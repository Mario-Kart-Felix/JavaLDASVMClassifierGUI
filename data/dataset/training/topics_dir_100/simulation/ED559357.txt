Executive Summary
W
hat is on the five-year horizon for higher 
education institutions? Which trends and 
technologies will drive educational change? 
What are the challenges that we consider as 
solvable or difficult to overcome, and how 
can we strategize effective solutions? These questions 
and similar inquiries regarding technology adoption and 
educational change steered the collaborative research 
and discussions of a body of 56 experts to produce 
the NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition, 
in partnership with the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative 
(ELI). The NMC Horizon Report series charts the five-year 
horizon for the impact of emerging technologies in 
learning communities across the globe. With more than 
13 years of research and publications, it can be regarded 
as the world’s longest-running exploration of emerging 
technology trends and uptake in education.
The experts agreed on two long-term trends: advancing 
learning environments that are flexible and drive 
innovation, as well as increasing the collaboration that 
takes place between higher education institutions. 
These are just two of the 18 topics analyzed in the NMC 
Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition, indicating 
the key trends, significant challenges, and important 
technological developments that are very likely to 
impact changes in higher education across the world 
over the next five years.  
Regarding the challenges for universities and colleges, 
improving digital literacy is considered one of the 
solvable challenges. It is already being addressed by 
actions at individual institutions. At The Open University 
in the UK, they developed the “Digital and Information 
Framework” to standardize and implement better 
digital literacy training in their curriculum. Cornell 
University also has made available online resources for 
learning key technology skills. On the other hand, the 
experts identified rewarding teachers for innovative 
and effective pedagogy as a wicked challenge — one 
that is impossible to define, let alone solve.  Many 
institutions provide more incentives for research over 
exemplary teaching.
In view of the trends and challenges observed, the 
panel also signalled the technological developments 
that could support these drivers of innovation and 
change. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the flipped 
classroom are expected to be increasingly adopted by 
institutions in one year’s time or less to make use of 
mobile and online learning. The time-to-adoption for 
makerspaces and wearable technology are estimated 
within two to three years, while adaptive learning 
technologies and the Internet of Things is expected to 
be mainstream in universities and colleges within four 
to five years. 
The three key sections of this report constitute a 
reference and straightforward technology-planning 
guide for educators, higher education leaders, 
administrators, policymakers, and technologists. It 
is our hope that this research will help to inform the 
choices that institutions are making about technology 
to improve, support, or extend teaching, learning, and 
creative inquiry in higher education across the globe. 
Education leaders worldwide look to the NMC Horizon 
Project and both its global and regional reports as key 
strategic technology planning references, and it is for 
that purpose that the NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher 
Education Edition is presented.
With more than 13 years of research 
and publications, the NMC Horizon 
Project can be regarded as the 
world’s longest-running exploration 
of emerging technology trends and 
uptake in education.

Introduction
I
n the pages that follow, 18 topics carefully selected 
by the 2015 Horizon Project Higher Education 
Expert Panel related to the educational applications 
of technology are examined, all of them areas very 
likely to impact technology planning and decision-
making over the next five years (2015-2019). Six key 
trends, six significant challenges, and six important 
developments in educational technology are placed 
directly in the context of their likely impact on the core 
missions of universities and colleges, and detailed in 
succinct, non-technical, and unbiased presentations. 
Each has been tied to essential questions of relevance, 
policy, leadership, and practice.
The NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition 
was produced by the NMC in collaboration with the 
EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative. The internationally 
recognized NMC Horizon Report series and regional NMC 
Technology Outlooks are part of the NMC Horizon Project, 
a comprehensive effort established in 2002 by the NMC 
that identifies and describes emerging technologies 
likely to have a large impact over the coming five years 
in education around the globe.The NMC Horizon Report: 
2015 Higher Education Edition is the 12th in the annual 
higher education series of reports and is produced by 
the NMC in collaboration with the EDUCAUSE Learning 
Initiative (ELI).
Key trends, challenges, and technological 
developments that are detailed here will directly inform 
policy, leadership, and practice at all levels impacting 
universities and colleges. This report aims to help 
universities, governing boards, and education leaders 
to strategically approach the further evolution of 
teaching, learning, and creative inquiry. Each topic has 
been carefully researched and framed in the context of 
its potential impact on global higher education. 
The report’s first two sections focus on an analysis 
of trends driving technology decision-making and 
planning, and the challenges likely to impede the 
adoption of new technologies, respectively. Each 
includes an explicit discussion of the trend or challenge’s 
implications for policy, leadership, and practice in 
universities and colleges, along with examples and 
relevant readings. 
The third section, in which six important developments 
in educational technology are described, is ultimately 
framed by these trends and challenges. The adoption 
or abandonment of these technologies by higher 
education institutions will be very much determined by 
the responses taken across the globe to these drivers of 
and obstacles to innovation and change. 
Each of the four global editions of the NMC Horizon 
Report — higher education, primary and secondary 
education (K-12), museum, and library — highlights 
six emerging technologies or practices that are likely 
to enter mainstream use within their focus sectors over 
the next five years. Key trends and challenges that will 
affect current practice over the same period frame these 
discussions. The discussions of trends and technologies 
have been organized into three time-related categories; 
challenges are discussed within a similar three-part 
framework related to the scope of the challenge.
Key trends, challenges, and 
technological developments  
that are detailed here will directly 
inform policy, leadership, and 
practice at all levels impacting 
universities and colleges.
Each topic closes with an annotated list of suggested 
readings and additional examples that expand on the 
discussion in the report. These resources, along with a 
wide collection of other helpful projects and readings, 
can all be found in the project’s open content database 
that is accessible via the free NMC Horizon EdTech 
Weekly App for iOS1 and Android devices.2 All the 
background materials for the NMC Horizon Report: 2015 
Higher Education Edition, including the research data, 
the preliminary selections, the topic preview, and this 
publication, can be downloaded for free on iTunes U.3
4 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
The process used to research and create the NMC 
Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition is rooted 
in the methods used across all the research conducted 
within the NMC Horizon Project. All editions of the 
NMC Horizon Report are informed by both primary 
and secondary research. Dozens of meaningful trends, 
challenges, and emerging technologies are examined 
for possible inclusion in the report for each edition. 
Every report draws on the considerable expertise of an 
international expert panel that first considers a broad 
set of important trends, challenges, and emerging 
technologies, and then examines each of them in 
progressively more detail, reducing the set until the 
final listing of trends, challenges, and technologies is 
selected. This process takes place online, where it is 
captured in the NMC Horizon Project wiki. The wiki is 
intended to be a completely transparent window into 
the work of the project, one that not only provides 
a real-time view of the work as it happens, but also 
contains the entire record of the process for each of the 
various editions published since 2006. The wiki used for 
the NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition 
can be found at horizon.wiki.nmc.org.
The panel was composed of 56 technology experts 
from 17 countries on six continents this year; their 
names and affiliations are listed at the end of this report. 
Despite their diversity of backgrounds and experience, 
they share a consensus view that each of the profiled 
technologies is going to have a significant impact on 
the practice of higher education around the globe over 
the next five years. The key trends driving interest in 
their adoption, and the significant challenges higher 
education institutions will need to address if they are to 
reach their potential, also represent their perspective.
The procedure for selecting the topics in the report is 
based on a modified Delphi process refined over the 
now 13 years of producing the NMC Horizon Report 
series, and began with the assembly of the panel. 
The panel represents a wide range of backgrounds, 
nationalities, and interests, yet each member brings a 
relevant expertise. Over the decade of the NMC Horizon 
Project research, more than 1,200 internationally 
recognized practitioners and experts have participated 
on the panels; in any given year, a third of panel 
members are new, ensuring a flow of fresh perspectives 
each year. Nominations to serve on the expert panel are 
encouraged; see go.nmc.org/horizon-nominate.
Once the panel for a particular edition is constituted, 
their work begins with a systematic review of the 
literature — press clippings, reports, essays, and other 
materials — that pertains to emerging technology. 
Members are provided with an extensive set of 
background materials when the project begins, and 
are then asked to comment on them, identify those 
that seem especially worthwhile, and add to the set. 
The group discusses existing applications of emerging 
technology and brainstorms new ones. A key criterion 
for the inclusion of a topic in this edition is its potential 
relevance to teaching, learning, and creative inquiry 
in higher education. A carefully selected set of RSS 
feeds from hundreds of relevant publications ensures 
that background resources stay current as the project 
progresses. They are used to inform the thinking of the 
participants.
Following the review of the literature, the expert panel 
engages in the central focus of the research — the 
research questions that are at the core of the NMC 
Horizon Project. These questions were designed to elicit 
a comprehensive listing of interesting technologies, 
challenges, and trends from the panel:
1Which of the key technologies catalogued in the NMC Horizon Project Listing will be most 
important to teaching, learning, or creative inquiry 
within the next five years?
2What key technologies are missing from our list? Consider these related questions:
> What would you list among the established 
technologies that some higher education 
institutions are using today that arguably 
all institutions should be using broadly to 
support or enhance teaching, learning, or 
creative inquiry?
> What technologies that have a solid user 
base in consumer, entertainment, or other 
industries should higher education institutions 
be actively looking for ways to apply?
> What are the key emerging technologies 
you see developing to the point that higher 
education institutions should begin to take 
notice during the next four to five years?
3What trends do you expect to have a significant impact on the ways in which higher education 
institutions approach our core missions of teaching, 
learning, and creative inquiry?
4What do you see as the key challenges related to teaching, learning, or creative inquiry that higher 
education institutions will face during the next five 
years?
In the first step of this approach, the responses to 
the research questions are systematically ranked and 
5
placed into adoption horizons by each expert panel 
member using a multi-vote system that allows members 
to weight and categorize their selections. These are 
compiled into a collective ranking, and inevitably, the 
ones around which there is the most agreement are 
quickly apparent.
From the comprehensive list of trends, challenges, 
and technologies originally considered for any report, 
the dozen that emerge at the top of the initial ranking 
process in each area are further researched and 
expanded. Once these interim results are identified, the 
group explores the ways in which these topics impact 
teaching and learning in higher education institutions. 
A significant amount of time is spent researching real 
and potential applications for each of the topics that 
would be of interest to practitioners. For every edition, 
when that work is done, each of these interim results 
topics is written up in the format of the NMC Horizon 
Report. With the benefit of the full picture of how the 
topic will look in the report, the topics in the interim 
results are then ranked yet again, this time in reverse. 
The final topics selected by the expert panel are those 
detailed here in the NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher 
Education Edition. 
Introduction
6 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
Key Trends Accelerating Technology Adoption in Higher 
Education
T
he six trends described in the following pages were 
selected by the project’s expert panel in a series of 
Delphi-based voting cycles, each accompanied 
by rounds of desktop research, discussions, and 
further refinements of the topics. These trends, 
which the members of the expert panel agreed are very 
likely to drive technology planning and decision-making 
over the next five years, are sorted into three movement-
related categories — long-term trends that typically 
have already been impacting decision-making, and 
will continue to be important for more than five years; 
mid-term trends that will likely continue to be a factor 
in decision-making for the next three to five years; and 
short-term trends that are driving edtech adoption now, 
but will likely remain important for only one to two years, 
becoming commonplace or fading away in that time.
While long-term trends have already been the topic 
of many education leaders’ discussions and extensive 
research, short-term trends often do not have an 
abundance of concrete evidence pointing to their 
effectiveness and future directions. All of the trends 
listed here were explored for their implications for 
higher education in a series of online discussions that 
can be viewed at horizon.wiki.nmc.org/Trends.
The NMC Horizon Project model derived three meta-di-
mensions that were used to focus the discussions of 
each trend and challenge: policy, leadership, and prac-
tice. Policy, in this context, refers to the formal laws, reg-
ulations, rules, and guidelines that govern universities 
and colleges; leadership is the product of experts’ visions 
of the future of learning, based on research and deep 
consideration; and practice is where new ideas and ped-
agogies take action, in universities and related settings.
Policy. While all of the identified trends had policy 
implications, two trends in particular are expected to 
have a strong impact on policy decisions in the next five 
years. The proliferation of open educational resources 
has emerged as a major topic of interest to national 
governments and universities, but requires effective 
policy to become mainstream in practice. The European 
Commission’s Institute for Prospective Technological 
Studies (IPTS) launched the “Opening Up Education” to 
assist in the formulation of guidelines in OER adoption 
and implementation.4
Likewise, measuring learning through data-driven 
practice and assessment, currently on the rise in 
universities in the developed world, will reach its 
maximum impact in higher education in about three 
to five years, but many leading institutions are moving 
considerably faster. The Open University in the UK has 
created policies that support the ethical use of learning 
analytics,5 and in the US, the recent Asilomar Conference 
convened educators, data scientists, and legal scholars 
to develop a framework to influence policy.6
These trends, which the members 
of the expert panel agreed are very 
likely to drive technology planning 
and decision-making over the next 
five years, are sorted into three 
movement-related categories.
Leadership. While there are leadership implications 
for all the identified trends that are discussed in the 
following pages, two trends stand out as unique 
opportunities for vision and leadership. The redesign of 
learning spaces requires initiative to imagine how the 
physical set-up of classrooms can better accommodate 
progressive teaching, but also how to share those ideas 
broadly. Launched by SUNY’s University at Buffalo, 
FLEXspace is an interactive online database that 
highlights best practices in design from universities all 
over the world.7
A long-term trend is the growth of collaboration 
between different higher education institutions. This 
trend reflects the notion that innovation can scale 
better when ideas are shared between institutions. The 
University of California Riverside is a notable example, 
co-founding the University Innovation Alliance with ten 
other universities to investigate emerging technologies 
and determine how they can best scale.8
7
Practice. Each of the six trends identified by the 
expert panel has numerous implications for teaching 
and learning practice, and current examples are easy 
to find. The increase of blended learning, highlighted 
as one of two developing short-term trends in the 
following pages, is bringing both technical and 
pedagogical enhancements to online and blended 
learning. Channel 9, for example, is a website that 
encompasses a library of training resources in computer 
coding and programming, with streaming videos and 
interactive events.9
All over the world, universities and colleges have 
been gradually rethinking how their organizations 
and infrastructures can be more agile. The thought is 
that if institutions are more flexible, they will be better 
able to support and promote entrepreneurial thinking 
— a long-term trend. At the University of Florida, the 
Innovation Academy acts as an incubator for students 
to plan and develop products and businesses, and even 
seek external funding.10
The following pages provide a discussion of each of 
the trends highlighted by this year’s expert panel that 
includes an overview of the trend, its implications, and 
a set of curated recommendations for further reading 
on the topic.
Key Trends
8 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
Advancing Cultures of Change and Innovation
Long-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for five or more years
M
any thought leaders have long believed 
that universities can play a major role 
in the growth of national economies. 
Research universities are generally 
perceived as incubators for new discoveries 
and innovations that directly impact their local 
communities and even the global landscape.11 In order 
to breed innovation and adapt to economic needs, 
higher education institutions must be structured in 
ways that allow for flexibility, and spur creativity 
and entrepreneurial thinking. There is a growing 
consensus among many higher education thought 
leaders that institutional leadership and curricula 
could benefit from agile startup models. Educators are 
working to develop new approaches and programs 
based on these models that stimulate top-down 
change and can be implemented across a broad range 
of institutional settings.12 In the business realm, the 
Lean Startup movement uses technology as a catalyst 
for promoting a culture of innovation in a more 
widespread, cost-effective manner, and provides 
compelling models for higher education leaders to 
consider.13
Overview
This topic reflects a broader trend in society in which 
businesses are adapting their strategies to remain 
relevant to consumers. A well-known example is the 
publishing industry, which has transitioned their focus 
in the past decade from print to digital to keep pace with 
the rapidly changing technology landscape. Similarly, 
many companies that once manufactured hardware 
and software packages have shifted to providing cloud-
based services. In the business of higher education, 
the consumers are the students, and there is a need to 
better cater to them as their expectations and behaviors 
evolve. In many ways, this shift is being driven by the 
technologies that students use in their daily lives and 
that extend to learning. For example, once it was clear 
that smartphones could play a major role in teaching 
and learning, institutions updated their infrastructures 
to accommodate BYOD programs. In this sense, it has 
become the responsibility of universities to foster 
environments that accelerate learning and creativity.14
The onus is on universities to create the conditions 
for innovation to happen.  In a recent speech to the 
Detroit Economics Club, the outgoing University of 
Michigan president asserted that the institution could 
be paramount in promoting more entrepreneurship 
throughout the state.15 She emphasized the need for 
universities to establish policies that spur more creativity 
and encourage more risk-taking, collaboration, and 
activities that more accurately reflect the contemporary 
workplace.  Bringing university organizational models 
into the future can translate into advancing local and 
global economies and cultures. A university lecturer and 
researcher from the University of Tampere in Finland 
published “The Roles of Universities in the Chinese 
Innovation Systems,” which showed a correlation 
between universities that emphasize technology use 
in improving China’s economy, especially in cultivating 
more technologically savvy graduates.16
Attitude is also key in adopting more organizational 
flexibility and innovative practices. The SUNY System 
hosted a conference in late 2014 — “Higher Education 
Reconsidered: Executing Change to Drive Collective 
Impact” — to identify tactics for SUNY universities to be 
more agile and forward-thinking. Their goal is to develop 
leadership that “understands the science of change,” 
systems that are more adaptive, and a culture that relies 
more on real evidence and data for decision making.17 
The US Department of Commerce published a report 
entitled “The Innovative and Entrepreneurial University,” 
which depicted the ways in which universities around 
the country are nurturing entrepreneurship within their 
infrastructure. Many examples highlight partnerships 
between the institutions with businesses and 
government agencies, including Clemson University’s 
International Center for Automotive Research.18
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
There is a need for policies that more aggressively support 
agility. The European Commission’s “Modernizing 
Universities” agenda focuses on implementing reform in 
higher education by restructuring institutions to enable 
faculty and students to be more active participants in 
the global marketplace of research and innovation. 
The EC’s goals include stimulating a more open 
research environment, fostering stronger partnerships 
with businesses, and rethinking how qualifications 
are recognized.19 In the US, university consortia are 
9
leading the charge. The Association of American 
Universities is dedicated to spreading innovation across 
campuses. They are championing a number of agendas 
and policies, including the Task Force on American 
Innovation, which advocates for greater government 
investments in innovative research projects in the fields 
of physical science and engineering.20 They also work 
with universities, government agencies, and businesses 
to implement more policies and university competitions 
that stimulate innovation and economic growth.21
It will require visionary leadership to build higher 
education environments that are equipped to quickly 
change processes and strategies as startups do. If these 
organizational models are designed well, universities 
can experience more efficient implementation of 
new practices and pedagogies. Aalborg University 
in Denmark is designed to spur more creativity and 
entrepreneurship, as it is a problem-based learning (PBL) 
university with the central values of interdisciplinary 
studies and innovation.22 UNESCO has placed its only 
Danish Chair at the university to oversee the continued 
development of the PBL model as it relates to students 
and faculty solving local and global issues.23 
There are many opportunities for higher education 
institutions to become leaders in promoting innovation 
across their campuses. The University of Florida, 
for example, launched the Innovation Academy, a 
community of students from more than 30 majors 
who are mentored in the areas of entrepreneurship 
and creativity. These students are encouraged to 
start and grow their own small businesses.24 Similarly, 
the Singapore Management University’s Institute of 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship helps faculty and 
students grow their own businesses through a variety 
of competitions and initiatives. Thus far, they have 
raised $3.7 million in grant funding and $9.4 million 
more in follow-up funding to further invest in the 110 
companies they have helped generate.25

Increasing Cross-Institution Collaboration
Long-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for five or more years
C
ollective action among universities is growing 
in importance for the future of higher 
education. More and more, institutions are 
joining consortia — associations of two or 
more organizations — to combine resources 
or to align themselves strategically with innovation 
in higher education. Today’s global environment is 
allowing universities to unite across international 
borders and work toward common goals concerning 
technology, research, or shared values. Support behind 
technology-enabled learning in higher education 
classrooms has reinforced the trend toward open 
communities and university consortia, as educators 
and administrators recognize collective action as 
a sustainable method of supporting upgrades in 
technological infrastructure and IT services.
Overview
The tradition of university associations and consortia 
originates in the early 20th century in the US, when 
universities began aligning with one another to 
meet common goals. Although purposes for creating 
consortium have grown more varied over time, the 
oldest collegiate partnerships were based on creating 
a network for which every associated institution could 
benefit from a collective pool of resources. One of the 
oldest consortia, Claremont Colleges, was established 
in 1925 and today joins five undergraduate colleges 
and two graduate universities. While each institution 
rewards degrees independently, enrolled students have 
access to specialized programs and expensive facilities 
of the partner schools outside of their institution. 
A sense of solidarity with learners is leading institutions 
to join together with the objective of increasing 
accessibility, affordability, and the quality of education 
on a global scale. The World University Consortium, 
for example, operates under these values, adopting 
a human-centric approach to education, developing 
a system that leverages online and hybrid learning 
strategies to reach people of all ages globally.26 
Technology also plays a key role in the creation of 
consortia. Universities are increasingly competitive 
environments, and campuses must constantly review 
and upgrade infrastructure to optimize their capacity. 
Deemed as a long-term trend, the prevalence of 
consortia underscores a vision of institutions as 
belonging to part of a larger ecosystem in which long-
term survival and relevance in higher education relies 
on the mutually beneficial partnerships.
Emerging consortia are founded with the express 
purpose of helping institutions continuously adopt best 
practices for digital learning. Founded in 2014, Unizin is 
a non-profit association that aims to create a common, 
scalable digital infrastructure through its role as a cloud-
based services operator.27 Steered by its members, 
Unizin offers content, platforms, and analytics that are 
sourced from its community of the nation’s top research 
institutions. Among the first commercial services offered 
to its members at scale is Canvas by Infrastructure, an 
open source LMS that aligns with Unizin’s commitment 
to global open standards.28 Guided by its focus on 
interoperability and open standards, Unizin will 
continue to develop services that help members to 
manage content their students and faculty create; to 
share this content across universities cost effectively; to 
promote interoperability among systems for teaching 
and learning; and to facilitate learning analytics with the 
aim of improving student outcomes.29
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Institutional policies often dictate the nature of 
consortia that university leaders are seeking. Carnegie 
Mellon University (CMU), for example, has a strong 
ethos about open access and open data for scholarly 
communications. This approach has been called strategic 
by the institution’s president who has underlined the 
importance of developing sustainable financial models 
for open access in order to disseminate works as broadly 
as possible.30  This is underscored by CMU’s membership 
in the Open Cloud Consortium (OCC), an open cloud 
computing infrastructure that facilitates community 
based science, in which researchers from member 
institutions, including the University of Chicago and 
Johns Hopkins University among others, can compile, 
analyze, and share huge data sets via the Open Science 
Data Cloud. Bolstered by the shared cloud computing 
service, researchers from CMU can work collaboratively 
with other scientists in a common area, increasing the 
efficacy and speed of research activities. 
Joining a consortium is often an institution’s way of 
11Long-Term Trend
defining its position as a leader of innovation and 
progress in a certain area. In a recent interview with 
The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Chancellor of 
University of California at Riverside discussed how the 
institution has managed to evolve with student success 
as a focal point.31 UC Riverside is a large public institution 
with a socio-economically diverse student population, 
yet it has fostered a system in which the number of 
underrepresented minority and low-income students 
graduate at the same rate as the campus average. 
In 2014, UC Riverside became one of 11 founding 
members of the University Innovation Alliance, a 
consortium dedicated to making high-quality degrees 
accessible to all students regardless of background. This 
specialized group of large, public research universities 
will be experimenting with new technologies, such as 
predictive analytics, in order to build on their success 
and bring innovation to scale.32 
BCNET is a consortium that has a long history of helping 
its members upgrade and maintain their technological 
infrastructure and IT services. Since 1998, BCNET has 
been unifying British Columbia’s public, post secondary 
sector as they explore and develop solutions to mutual 
IT challenges, bringing together 25 public universities 
and 18 research institutions in the region. In BCNET’s 
2014 annual report, ROC: Return on Collaboration, the 
consortium presented several examples of successful 
initiatives at member sites, including an account of 
how BCNET engineers helped Kwantlen Polytechnic 
University (KPU) build the IT foundation to realize its 
vision for 2018.  In order to achieve its goals of 5% annual 
growth, expansion of continuing and professional 
studies, and improvement in learner engagement and 
retention, KPU turned to BCNET to support them as they 
planned and implemented a strategy that incorporates 
a high-capacity campus network and cloud video 
conferencing services at scale.33

Growing Focus on Measuring Learning
Mid-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for three to five years
T
here is an increasing interest in using new 
sources of data for personalizing the learning 
experience, for ongoing formative assessment 
of learning, and for performance measurement; 
this interest is spurring the development of 
a relatively new field — data-driven learning and 
assessment. A key element of this trend is learning 
analytics, the application of web analytics, a science 
used by businesses to analyze commercial activities 
that leverages big data to identify spending trends and 
predict consumer behavior. Education is embarking on 
a similar pursuit into data science with the aim of learner 
profiling, a process of gathering and analyzing large 
amounts of detail about individual student interactions 
in online learning activities.34 The goal is to build better 
pedagogies, empower students to take an active part 
in their learning, target at-risk student populations, 
and assess factors affecting completion and student 
success. For learners, educators, and researchers, 
learning analytics is already starting to provide crucial 
insights into student progress and interaction with 
online texts, courseware, and learning environments 
used to deliver instruction. Data-driven learning and 
assessment will build on those early efforts.
Overview
Data are routinely collected, measured, and analyzed in 
the consumer sector to inform companies about nearly 
every aspect of customer behavior and preferences. A 
number of researchers and companies are working to 
design similar analytics that reveal patterns in learning-
related data that can be used to improve learning both 
for individual students, and across institutions and 
systems. The types of student data being analyzed vary, 
but include institutional information such as student 
profile information (age, address, and ethnicity), 
course selections, and pace of program completion; 
engagement data such as number of page views, 
contributions by students to discussion threads, 
percentage of students completing assignments, 
and number of logins; and learning analytics such as 
which concepts were mastered and which concepts 
were particularly difficult for a student.35 While many 
experiments are underway, leaders are just beginning to 
understand which data is useful for advancing learning, 
as well as the scope of privacy and ethics issues.36 
The emerging science of learning analytics is providing 
the statistical and data mining tools to recognize 
challenges early, improve student outcomes, and 
personalize the learning experience. With recent 
developments in online learning in particular, 
students are generating an exponential amount of 
data that can offer a more comprehensive look at their 
learning.37 A recent report by the National Institute 
for Learning Outcomes and Assessment found that 
student assessment is emerging as a leading priority 
for institutions of higher education because of pressure 
from accrediting and governing entities and the 
growing need for more and better evidence of student 
achievement. They reported that in 2013, nearly 84% 
of colleges and universities surveyed adopted stated 
learning outcomes for all of their undergraduates, up 
from 10% in 2009, and the range of tools and measures 
used to assess student learning has expanded greatly.38 
While maintaining its position as a mid-term trend from 
last year’s report, this topic is experiencing increasing 
activity as projects around the world launch pilots 
and implementations. Victoria University in Australia, 
for example, moved to a blended learning strategy 
that required a change in their LMS. They revitalized 
their e-learning environment by using the data 
analytics platform Brightspace for detailed reporting, 
assessment, and collaboration.39 After a pilot of four 
courses confirmed the potential high value of adopting 
learning analytics, Nottingham Trent University (NTU) 
in the UK introduced the NTU student dashboard that 
features learning analytics software that aggregates 
data on library use, attendance, and grades.40 In the US, 
California State University is also developing a Student 
Success Dashboard to help university leaders better 
understand problematic areas and assist in determining 
the effectiveness of specific interventions they have 
implemented.41
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
In online environments especially, students are 
generating a large amount of learning-related data 
that could inform important decisions in addition to 
the learning process, but there is more work needed 
to structure appropriate policies to protect student 
privacy. There is a growing concern that ethical and 
13
privacy considerations are not advancing as quickly 
as practice.42 The Open University in the UK produced 
policy on the ethical use of student data for learning 
analytics, grounded on eight key principles that are 
linked to particular facets of collecting and analyzing 
student data.43 Progress is also being made in the US. 
In 2014, educators, scientists, and legal/ethical scholars 
gathered at the Asilomar Conference in California to 
develop a framework that will inform the ethical use of 
data and technology in learning research. Six principles 
emerged: respect for the rights of learners, beneficence, 
justice, openness, the humanity of learning, and 
continuous consideration.44
University leaders are demonstrating their commitment 
to the use of learning data through the addition of 
new offices and partnerships, including the University 
of Maryland’s new Office of Analytics and their 
cooperation with the Predictive Analytics Reporting 
(PAR) Framework, Civitas Learning, and Transfer 
Data Repository. By sharing data on retention and 
progression with other institutions, universities can 
benchmark their progress. In the PAR project, the 
University of Maryland found that they had higher 
freshman retention rates than many of their peers, 
but fell behind others for students in years two and 
three.45 Similarly, the Marist College and University of 
Amsterdam announced the Apereo Learning Analytics 
community in 2014 to accelerate the operationalization 
of learning analytics software and frameworks, support 
cross-institutional pilots, and avoid duplication.46 The 
sharing of best practices, research, emerging tools, and 
proven strategies are hallmarks of this trend.47
Data-driven projects at universities are beginning to 
mature and are revealing promising results. At the 
University of Wisconsin, the Student Success System pilot 
program was initiated to identify struggling students 
and behavioral patterns. In addition to expanding 
pilot courses and institutional partners in the project’s 
second year, there is an effort to foster a community of 
interest and practice, which is being accomplished by 
incorporating data analytics discussions into faculty 
professional development and inviting experts in the 
field of learning analytics to engage with the faculty 
community.48 Dashboards, visual representations of 
data that are integrated in many management systems, 
are also currently being used by a number of universities 
as a way to personalize the learning experience. These 
sorts of tools can provide students with the means 
of understanding their progress.49 Examples of new 
commercially available dashboards include Enterprise 
Analytics,50 Campus Quad Engage,51 and Jenzabar 
Analytics.52

14 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
Proliferation of Open Educational Resources
Mid-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for three to five years
D
efined by the Hewlett Foundation in 2002, open 
educational resources (OER) are “teaching, 
learning, and research resources that reside 
in the public domain or have been released 
under an intellectual property license that 
permits their free use and re-purposing by others.”53 
Momentum behind OER began early on, getting a 
major boost when the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology founded the MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) 
initiative in 2001, making MIT instruction materials 
for over 2,200 of its courses available online, free of 
charge. Soon after, prestigious universities including 
Carnegie Mellon University and Harvard University, 
among others, pushed forward their own open learning 
initiatives. Understanding that the term “open” is 
a multifaceted concept is essential to following this 
trend in higher education; often mistaken to simply 
mean “free of charge,” advocates of openness have 
worked towards a common vision that defines it more 
broadly — not just free in economic terms, but also in 
terms of ownership and usage rights.
Overview
Altogether, OER represents a broad variety of digital 
content, including full courses, course materials, 
modules, textbooks, videos, tests, software, and any 
other means of conveying knowledge. OER uses 
Creative Commons and alternative licensing schemes 
to more easily distribute knowledge, media, and 
educational resources, which guarantees that content 
is freely copiable, freely remixable, and free of barriers 
to access, cultural sensitivities, sharing, and educational 
use. Open textbooks are being considered as a viable 
means for cutting excess costs with the goal of making 
education more affordable for students. According 
to a 2014 study by US PIRG Education Fund and the 
Student PIRGs, of 2,039 students surveyed, 65% said 
that they had not bought a textbook due to its high 
price. Open textbooks are open-source e-books that are 
freely available with nonrestrictive licenses, and have 
been popularized by projects such as Rice University’s 
Open Stax College54 and College Open Textbooks,55 a 
non-profit collaborative of over 200 universities and 29 
organizations.
While OER is gaining traction across campuses, its 
broader acceptance into higher education hinges on 
the issue of awareness and accessibility.56 Babson Survey 
Research Group published an in-depth exploration of 
OER uptake in higher education throughout the US and 
found that among 2,144 faculty members surveyed, 
the majority demonstrated benevolent attitudes about 
using OER, unlike other technological advances in 
teaching.57 Yet the survey revealed that awareness of 
OER and related issues was significantly scarce, with 
only 5.1% of respondents answering that they were 
“very aware” of OER and its use in the classroom.58 More 
than half of the respondents said they were deterred by 
the lack of search tools or a comprehensive catalog of 
materials.59  While understanding about OER is lacking, 
Babson researchers highlighted why knowledge in 
this area has the potential to increase greatly over the 
next three years; more than three-quarters of faculty 
members indicated that they expected to use OER or 
would consider using OER in the future.60 
There are a number of existing OER repositories 
and search tools in place for the higher education 
community. Among the first, MERLOT was started in 
1997 by California State University, and has since been 
offering its members a platform to create, share, and 
curate online learning materials.61 Similarly, Jorum is 
a portal for university educators in the UK to collect 
and share OER.62 Funded by JISC, Jorum allows users 
to filter materials based on community, institution, 
author, keyword, and license, among other search 
criteria.63 Mexico’s Tecnológico de Monterrey has been 
compiling and sharing OER through “Temoa,” an online 
portal with over 500,000 learning materials, each 
subject to different conditions related to control of use, 
reproduction, interpretation, and material distribution 
established by each author. Started in 2008, “Temoa” 
invites users to participate as collaborators, cataloguers, 
and auditors, to evaluate the credibility of materials in 
their areas of expertise.64
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Governmental policies have done much to shape 
OER’s path through higher education environments 
around the world. Researchers from IPTS documented 
the trajectory of OER policies, attitudes, and trends in 
“OER: A European Policy Perspective.” They highlight 
the creation of the “Opening Up Education” initiative in 
15Mid-Term Trend
2013 as an essential framework to develop integrated 
economies of access and unimpeded exchange of 
knowledge across borders in order for Europe to remain 
competitive.65 Experts point out that although the 
OER has solid footing in secondary schools, policies 
for higher education are scarcer due to institutional 
autonomy. Yet top-down initiatives funded by public 
institutions and foundations exist to help universities 
pursue large-scale OER integration, such as the Support 
Centre for Open Resources in Education led by the Open 
University. 
While data shows that some faculty are integrating OER 
on their own,66 institutional leadership can reinforce the 
use of open content. Produced by the Office of the Pro 
Vice Chancellor, the University of South Africa (Unisa) 
developed an Open Education Resources Strategy for 
2014-2016 to introduce a new business model and 
detailed plan for the assimilation of open resources into 
courses.  The Unisa strategy acknowledges that emerging 
technologies, such as MOOCs and open badges, have 
disrupted the institution’s traditional means of earning 
revenue, and emphasizes OER’s potential for helping 
the university redirect its focus from content delivery 
to the improvement of academic and administrative 
services.  Furthermore, Unisa highlights open licensing 
and sharing as a method of promoting their learning 
experience to prospective students, with the larger goal 
of becoming a major producer and distributor of high-
quality instructional materials and information.67 
Regional communities of practice have formed to 
provide a foundation of knowledge and tools for 
educators as they integrate OER into their instruction. 
The North-West OER Network, for example, is an online 
resource that encourages collaboration between 13 
higher education institutions in the North-West of 
England.68 The project began in Spring 2014 with a five-
day open online course called “Openness in Education” 
as a way of on-boarding its member institutions during 
Open Education Week. Learners were encouraged to 
participate in Google Hangouts, share their thoughts 
in Twitter discussions, or reflect on their learning via 
the Facebook community page.69 Led by the Centre 
for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at Manchester 
Metropolitan University, the project maintains a website 
that offers several ways for member institutions to stay 
informed including a dedicated Google+ community 
and a comprehensive list of OER search engines.70

Increasing Use of Blended Learning 
Short-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for the next one to two years
O
ver the past several years, perceptions of 
online learning have been shifting in its favor 
as more learners and educators see it as a 
viable alternative to some forms of face-to-face 
learning. Drawing from best practices in online 
and face-to-face methods, blended learning is on the rise 
at universities and colleges. The affordances blended 
learning offers are now well understood, and its flexibility, 
ease of access, and the integration of sophisticated 
multimedia and technologies are high among the list of 
appeals. Recent developments of business models for 
universities are upping the ante of innovation in these 
digital environments, which are now widely considered 
to be ripe for new ideas, services, and products. While 
growing steadily, the recent focus in many education 
circles on the rapid rise and burnout of massive open 
online courses (MOOCs) has led to the view that these 
sorts of offerings may be fad-like. However, progress in 
learning analytics; adaptive learning; and a combination 
of cutting-edge asynchronous and synchronous tools will 
continue to advance the state of online learning and keep 
it compelling, though many of these methods are still the 
subjects of experiments and research by online learning 
providers and higher education institutions.
Overview
Recently, the US National Center for Education Statistics 
reported that one in ten students were enrolled 
exclusively in online courses.71 Studies conducted by the 
Babson Research Group reveal that 7.1 million American 
students are engaged in online learning in some form.72 
As online learning garners increasing interest, higher 
education institutions are developing more online 
courses to both replace and supplement existing 
courses. While the effectiveness varies from course to 
course, it has become clear that there is a demand from 
students for more accessible learning opportunities, 
and blended learning — the combination of online and 
face-to-face instruction — is a model currently being 
explored by many higher education institutions.
The University of Central Florida examined face-to-face, 
blended, and fully online models and found that blended 
approaches were most successful in “unbundling” the 
classroom — students felt that instructors were more 
accessible when learning materials and discussion 
forums were placed online and there was altogether more 
persistent communication through the use of virtual 
learning environments.73 When assessing the quality 
of courses, researchers pinpointed clarity, authenticity, 
unity, suspense, economy, depth, proportion, vividness, 
brilliance, sensitivity, emphasis, authority, flow, and 
precision as the ultimate benchmarks. Institutions and 
instructors now have a better understanding that online 
learning opportunities need to encompass each of these 
characteristics; the task for higher education leaders for 
the next two years will revolve around how courses can 
be better designed, from conception to execution. 
According to the University of Illinois, effective blended 
learning instructors must find ways to stimulate 
social activities and critical thinking within an online 
environment — just as they are expected to do in face-
to-face experiences.74 They also emphasize the need 
to support different learning preferences by enabling 
multiple ways for learners to engage with a concept.75 
Some students may absorb the material better through 
reading passages in online textbooks, while others may 
respond better by progressing through a playlist of video 
lectures and other supporting media. Furthermore, 
instructors are thinking more deeply about mimicking 
the types of interactions learners are accustomed to in 
brick-and-mortar settings. Cloud-based audio tools such 
as VoiceThread76 and SoundCloud,77 along with video 
creation tools such as iMovie78 and Dropcam,79 allow 
faculty to capture important human gestures, including 
voice, eye contact, and body language, which all foster 
an unspoken connection with learners.
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Many higher education institutions recognize the 
need for concrete online learning guidelines and are 
taking it upon themselves to devise effective policies. 
The University of Glasgow, for example, released 
“E-Learning Strategy 2013-2020,” a whitepaper that 
outlines best practices for the campus and increases the 
range and accessibility of the online learning methods 
that faculty can adopt.80 Among their priorities is the 
use of a flexible virtual environment that incorporates 
interactive features to make learning more social for 
students. In regards to how online learning programs 
can be best managed and organized at an institutional 
and departmental level, California State University, 
17
Sacramento has published their own policies.81 On their 
campus, online course evaluation has been standardized 
to mirror face-to-face evaluation, and all resources that 
are placed online must satisfy current CSU policy to 
improve accessibility for students with disabilities.
Advancing the field of blended learning will require 
continuous visionary leadership. The European Distance 
and E-Learning Network (EDEN) consists of 200 member 
institutions and was founded to spread knowledge and 
best practices across the continent. EDEN is currently 
involved in a number of online initiatives that promote 
the use of emerging technologies and pedagogies for 
online learning, including LACE (Learning Analytics 
Community Exchange) and POERUP, which focuses 
on the integration of open educational resources in 
learning. The European Journal of Open, Distance and 
E-Learning is also supported by EDEN as a forum for 
sharing the latest research and development in online 
learning practices.82 In the US, Penn State University and 
the Sloan Consortium are advancing a similar push for 
innovation in blended learning. The two organizations 
joined forces to launch the Institute for Engaged 
Leadership in Online Learning — a blended learning 
leadership development program that identifies key 
challenges and focus areas for the field.83
In practice, there are a number of innovative examples 
of online learning programs, some of which specialize in 
helping students acquire in-demand skill sets. Channel 
9 provides users with a growing library of training 
resources in nearly any type of computer coding 
and programming, and offers streaming videos and 
interactive events.84 While they remain a controversial 
topic laden with mixed reviews and opinions, MOOCs 
have enabled students to engage in learning at their own 
pace.  Johns Hopkins University offers a MOOC through 
Coursera — “Getting and Cleaning Data.” Video lectures 
and online quizzes help students learn about obtaining 
data through API’s and databases, and includes peer-to-
peer assessments to make for a more social experience.85

Redesigning Learning Spaces
Short-Term Trend: Driving Ed Tech adoption in higher education for the next one to two years
S
ome thought leaders believe that new forms of 
teaching and learning require new spaces for 
teaching and learning. More universities are 
helping to facilitate these emerging models of 
education, such as the flipped classroom, by 
rearranging learning environments to accommodate 
more active learning.86 Educational settings are 
increasingly designed to facilitate project-based 
interactions with attention to mobility, flexibility, and 
multiple device usage. Wireless bandwidth is being 
upgraded in institutions to create “smart rooms” 
that support web conferencing and other methods of 
remote, collaborative communication. Large displays 
and screens are being installed to enable collaboration 
on digital projects and informal presentations. As 
higher education continues to move away from 
traditional lecture-based programming and to more 
hands-on scenarios, university classrooms will start 
to resemble real-world work and social environments 
that facilitate organic interactions and cross-
disciplinary problem solving.
Overview
A student-centered approach to education has taken 
root, prompting many higher education professionals 
to rethink how learning spaces should be configured.87 
The mold of the traditional classroom is being broken by 
several institutions to accommodate new pedagogies; 
instead of the traditional rows of chairs with writing 
surfaces facing a podium, universities are creating 
more dynamic classroom layouts, often with seating 
arrangements that foster collaborative work. These 
redesigned spaces support what is often referred to as 
flexible or active learning.88 While active learning spaces 
vary, they share many common features. The typical 
podium is moved from the front of the classroom to the 
center and is surrounded by round or oval tables with 
movable chairs that enable students to shift between 
groups as needed. Each table may be technology-
enabled, with interactive whiteboards or other marking 
surfaces. Many examples of these arrangements, such as 
at McGill University and Dawson College in Canada, have 
been in use for several years.89 
This shift is also requiring universities to examine how 
informal campus environments can be modified to 
become theaters for learning.90 Casual spaces in high-
traffic areas such as lobbies, atriums, and hallways are 
being purposefully redesigned so that they can become 
locations where students congregate and work more 
productively. They often feature comfortable furniture, 
power outlets for charging mobile devices, and LCD 
monitors for connecting laptops.91 Loughborough 
University in the UK has created three distinct informal 
learning areas where students can work collaboratively 
or independently. Their Learning Lounge features 16 PCs 
and an interactive Utouch display; the Learning Zone is 
outfitted with 12 PCs, two interactive whiteboards with 
connected PCs, two group tables, and flipcharts; and the 
Learning Lab contains three collaborative work zones, 
a group table, and vending facilities to keep students 
fueled during their study sessions.92 
Academic libraries across the globe are seeing a flurry 
of activity as their informal learning spaces are being 
reimagined to take advantage of the emerging maker 
movement. Libraries have always been spaces to find 
tools for learning and some argue that in addition 
to books, 3D printers, laser cutters, and even sewing 
machines should be available to students. The physical 
layout of university libraries is currently being redrawn 
so that row upon row of stacks containing books that 
have not been touched in decades can be archived to 
make room for more productive use of floor space.93 
The DeLaMare Science and Engineering Library at the 
University of Nevada Reno, for example, was recently 
named one of the most interesting makerspaces in 
America by Make magazine. Over the summer of 2014, 
the ground floor of their facility was remodeled to create 
a more functional space for self-directed learning using 
new visualization hardware and software.94
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
While many learning space policies fall under a university’s 
general appropriate use of information technology 
resources and systems principles, the evaluation of new 
spaces is being guided by a new Learning Spaces Rating 
System (LSRS) which provides a set of measurable criteria 
to assess the effectiveness of classroom design for 
promoting active learning activities. This rating system 
eliminates competing internal guidelines to enable 
benchmarking across institutions, helping universities 
identify lower- or higher-performing spaces within their 
19Short-Term Trend
portfolios. The preliminary rating system currently allows 
the measurement of formal learning spaces, but future 
iterations will include informal and specialized learning 
spaces.95 The LSRS is based on Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) green building ratings 
systems, which promote sustainability in the planning 
of buildings, interiors, and schools. Policymakers can 
refer to this emerging system of rating and underlying 
research to support decisions to scale innovative 
classroom layouts with technology. 
Campus leaders can work with instructional 
technologists and strategists when building technology 
ecosystems that are compatible, secure, and easy to 
update. One noteworthy resource is the Flexible Learning 
Environments eXchange (FLEXspace), an interactive, 
searchable online database containing best practices 
in active learning design. The site contains three main 
taxonomies that focus on technology integration, 
facilities integration, and learning and assessment.96 The 
Learning Spaces Collaboratory (LSC) is another initiative 
that is gathering findings in contemporary research 
and practice to guide the creation and assessment of 
learning environments in undergraduate settings. This 
collaboration involves the perspectives of academics, 
architects, and other stakeholders.97 
Before new technologies are introduced, faculty must 
consider how they fit into the current course structure 
and make necessary changes to the physical space. 
Australia’s University of Western Sydney recently 
updated their curriculum to provide more options for 
their students. By 2016, all undergraduate courses will be 
offered in blended form.98 To support this new structure, 
the university created collaborative learning spaces 
that support group activities outside of classroom 
settings through mobile furniture, dual projection 
screens, and maximized wall-writing surfaces — among 
other amenities. More authentic learning experiences 
are also driving the redesign of learning spaces in 
the medical field. George Washington University’s 
Nursing Simulation Lab, for example, is an experiential 
learning space designed to provide a more realistic 
learning laboratory that mimics the actual hospital 
environment. Key features of the laboratory include a 
model emergency room suite, strategically embedded 
cameras and microphones to capture trainings, live 
streaming access to the lab, and a system capable of 
closed-circuit broadcast to a 100-seat lecture hall and 
50-seat classroom.99

Significant Challenges Impeding Technology Adoption in 
Higher Education
T
he six challenges described on the following 
pages were selected by the project’s expert panel 
in a series of Delphi-based cycles of discussion, 
refinement, and voting; the expert panel was 
in consensus that each is very likely to impede 
the adoption of one or more new technologies if 
unresolved. A complete record of the discussions and 
related materials were captured in the online work site 
used by the expert panel and archived at horizon.wiki.
nmc.org/Challenges.
Because not all challenges are of the same scope, the 
discussions here are sorted into three categories defined 
by the nature of the challenge. The Horizon Project 
defines solvable challenges as those that we both 
understand and know how to solve; difficult challenges 
are ones that are more or less well-understood but for 
which solutions remain elusive; and wicked challenges, 
the most difficult, are categorized as complex to even 
define, and thus require additional data and insights 
before solutions will even be possible. Once the list of 
challenges was identified, they were examined through 
three meta-expressions: their implications for policy, 
leadership, and practice.
Policy. While all of the identified challenges had policy 
implications, two specific challenges are driving policy 
decisions on many campuses at the moment. The easiest 
one to address is creating policies that better advance 
digital literacy. Governments at both the national and 
local level are already making ample headway. The 
Massachusetts Department of Education, for example, 
has convened expert panelists from higher education 
and K-12 to develop “Digital Literacy and Computer 
Science Standards.” Tapping into the knowledge and 
experiences of university leaders and instructors, the 
goal is to better prepare students in understanding and 
creatively applying technology before they even step 
foot on campus.100
A more challenging policy area is that there is a great 
deal of competition from new models of education. The 
growing abundance of free online learning courses and 
resources that can be digested at the learner’s own pace 
is calling into question the need for traditional four-year 
institutions. In the US, President Obama and the US 
Department of Education took actions to redefine the 
credit hour to encompass different kinds of activities 
that reflect learning outcomes.101
Because not all challenges are  
of the same scope, the  
discussions here are sorted  
into three categories defined by  
the nature of the challenge.
Leadership. Again, while all the identified challenges 
have leadership implications that are discussed in the 
following pages, two pose roadblocks to employing 
effective vision and leadership. There is a major need 
to integrate more personalized learning into university 
courses and accommodate each student’s needs, but 
this will not be possible overnight.  The Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation has been instrumental in working 
to solve this challenge. They recently founded the 
Personal Learning Network which convenes more than 
one dozen colleges and universities to investigate and 
implement potential applications of personalized and 
adaptive learning.102
The lack of rewards for exemplary teaching is considered 
by the panel as a wicked challenge that requires 
visionary leadership. Universities are set up in ways that 
inherently emphasize research over teaching. Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Center for Teaching Excellence 
and Educational Innovation is focused on being an 
incubator for progressive pedagogies. Noteworthy 
professors are selected for the Spotlight on Innovative 
Teaching program, where they impart their wisdom to 
other educators in the form of workshops.103
Practice. Each of the six challenges identified by 
the expert panel presents numerous impediments for 
advancing teaching and learning, but two in particular 
are presenting unique obstacles. Fortunately, the expert 
panel perceives the blending of formal and informal 
learning to be a solvable challenge. Cork Institute of 
21
Technology in Ireland is providing a compelling model 
for other universities by incorporating and rewarding 
work experience and other kinds of learning experience 
into a formal setting.104
Teaching more complex thinking has also been a 
challenge for higher education institutions, especially in 
very singularly focused disciplines such as biology and 
mechanical engineering. At Yale University, a molecular, 
cellular, and developmental virology professor designed 
a four-course series to train postdoctoral and graduate 
science students in creating effective presentations and 
public speeches.105
The following pages provide a discussion of each of the 
challenges highlighted by this year’s expert panel that 
includes an overview of the challenge, its implications, 
and a set of curated recommendations for further 
reading on the topic.
Significant Challenges

Blending Formal and Informal Learning
Solvable Challenge: Those that we understand and know how to solve
T
raditional approaches to teaching and learning 
with roots in the 18th century and earlier are 
still very common in many institutions, and 
often stifle learning as much as they foster it. 
As the Internet has brought the ability to learn 
something about almost anything to the palm of 
one’s hand, there is an increasing interest in the kinds 
of self-directed, curiosity-based learning that has 
long been common in museums, science centers, and 
personal learning networks. These and other more 
serendipitous forms of learning fall under the banner 
of informal learning, and serve to enhance student 
engagement by encouraging them to follow their own 
learning pathways and interests. Many experts believe 
that a blending of formal and informal methods of 
teaching and learning can create a higher education 
environment that fosters experimentation, curiosity, 
and above all, creativity.106
Overview
The blending of informal learning into formal education is 
an intriguing notion, but hampered by the lack of ways to 
acknowledge and qualify learning that happens beyond 
the classroom. Adding complexity to the matter is the 
ability for institutions to quantify the kinds of informal 
learning experiences in which students engage. Some 
argue that in order to integrate informal education into the 
formal higher education system, skills that have tangible, 
transferable value in the real world must be identified 
and promoted as key competencies.107 Many workplaces 
already encourage informal learning methods for 
professional development; Cisco’s Technology Evangelist 
even cites the act of convening with like-minded people 
at a restaurant or coffee shop to discuss pressing topics in 
the IT industry as a creative example.108 However, people 
rarely receive formal or substantial recognition for these 
experiences, setting a shaky precedent for informal 
learning at universities and colleges.
Regardless of whether or not it is being rewarded, 
informal learning is already impacting how students 
gain and demonstrate knowledge. According to an 
article published in the EDUCAUSE Review, “A growing 
appreciation for the porous boundaries between the 
classroom and life experience, along with the power 
of social learning, authentic audiences, and integrative 
contexts, has created not only promising changes in 
learning but also disruptive moments in teaching.”109 
Indeed, the ways in which people learn have been 
expanding as more and more interactive content has 
been made freely available via the web. The Hechinger 
Report points to games and videos as two of the primary 
ways that students learn outside of their schooling. 
Games are cited specifically for their applications in 
developing inductive reasoning skills.110 An increasing 
number of universities, such as Stanford University111 
and MIT112 are leveraging the soft skills that games have 
proven to instill in learners, integrating games into their 
curriculum designs to simulate real world activities.
Social media and its tapestry of networks, articles, videos, 
and other resources are also making learning more 
ubiquitous. The 2013 “E-Expectations Report” found that 
students trust information delivered through universities’ 
social media more than if the same content was posted 
to universities’ websites.113 Social media has transcended 
its initial usage for building social connections;114 
people increasingly rely on their Facebook and Twitter 
newsfeeds, for example, to stay up to date on major 
global events, and even use these platforms as a vehicle 
for sharing and garnering feedback on personal creative 
works. The book Personal Learning Networks explores the 
ways in which social media can stimulate new learning 
pathways.115 As an example, social networks enable the 
creation of learning teams that mimic interest groups — 
students are able to congregate by areas of curiosity and 
even learn from each other.
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
While much work has been done to define and explore 
aspects of informal learning, ways to formally evaluate 
those experiences are not as well understood. There is a 
need for national policies that guide the substantiation 
of informal learning across education systems. Launched 
by European University Continuing Education Network, 
VALERU is the development of methodology for 
validating informal learning in Russia.116 VALERU is 
focused on how students’ learning outcomes that were 
generated outside of higher education can be integrated 
into study programs. Using the framework that initiative 
leaders aim to devise over the next few years, more 
experts will be trained to expand the pool of informal 
learning validators in Russia.
23
At a global leadership level, OECD has acknowledged that 
learning happens constantly, and that capturing insights 
around informal learning can provide governments 
with critical information for improving educational 
opportunities. In 2010, they worked with representatives 
from 22 countries to compile their experiences in a 
report entitled “Recognising Non-Formal and Informal 
Learning,” which provides a foundation for countries 
to begin defining learning and skills gained outside of 
formal institutions.117 The goal of this work is a massive 
undertaking — to be able to accurately assess human 
capital within a nation with the aim of strengthening 
the economy.118 A similar report by JISC, “Learning in a 
Digital Age,” discussed the growing use of blogs, wikis, 
podcasting, social networking, and other tools as 
vehicles to deepen learning.119 In the US, the National 
Science Foundation Directorate for Education and 
Human Resources is funding grants that emphasize the 
need to gain a better grip on informal learning,120 with 
projects including Advancing Informal STEM Learning.121 
Researchers and faculty at the Cork Institute of Technology 
in Ireland have been dedicated to incorporating informal 
learning experiences into their offerings. As described 
in the paper “Capturing and Valuing Non Formal and 
Informal Learning: Higher Education can Support 
Learning Gained in Life,” they hosted Cork City’s Lifelong 
Learning Festival, which joined together adult learners 
who had re-enrolled at local universities and colleges. The 
event highlighted the development of a digital archive 
where students can present on their most influential 
informal learning experiences as they unfold. Additionally, 
the Institute held a workshop that introduced students 
to e-portfolios with the goal of understanding how they 
can be best applied to showcase informal learning and 
creative projects that occur outside of the college.122 
Educators are also major beneficiaries of solutions to 
this challenge as there is a growing host of informal 
professional development opportunities for them — 
many of which take place exclusively online, including 
the NMC’s own Academy for teacher training,123 HP LIFE 
e-Learning,124 and the European Schoolnet Academy.125

Solvable Challenge
24 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
Improving Digital Literacy
Solvable Challenge: Those that we understand and know how to solve
W
ith the proliferation of the Internet, mobile 
devices, and other technologies that are 
now pervasive in education, the traditional 
view of literacy as the ability to read 
and write has expanded to encompass 
understanding digital tools and information. This new 
category of competence is affecting how education 
institutions address literacy issues in their curriculum 
objectives and teacher development programs. 
Lack of consensus on what comprises digital literacy 
is impeding many colleges and universities from 
formulating adequate policies and programs that 
address this challenge. Discussions among educators 
have included the idea of digital literacy as equating to 
competence with a wide range of digital tools for varied 
educational purposes, or as an indicator of having the 
ability to critically evaluate resources available on 
the web.126 However, both definitions are broad and 
ambiguous. Compounding this issue is the notion 
that digital literacy encompasses skills that differ for 
educators and learners, as teaching with technology is 
inherently different from learning with it. Supporting 
digital literacy will require policies that both address 
digital fluency training in pre- and in-service teachers, 
along with the students they teach.
Overview
While this challenge is widespread in higher education, 
the 2015 Horizon Project Expert Panel recognized it as 
solvable as it has already been made actionable by local 
and national governments. In the UK, the Leicester City 
Council hosted a live panel to tackle this challenge, 
and set out to establish a common definition of digital 
literacy, characterizing it as a life-long practice that 
includes critical thinking about how the skills can be 
applied and used for social engagement.127 A JISC 
consultant at the event stated that developing digital 
literacy in practice requires individual scaffolding and 
support along with helping learners as they manage 
conflict between practice and different contexts. As 
an example, a student’s notion of what is considered 
referencing a resource versus plagiarizing it may differ 
from that of their university’s official policy.
Researchers at Kennesaw State University recently 
published the paper “Unraveling the Digital Literacy 
Paradox: How Higher Education Fails at the Fourth 
Literacy,” which critically examines the current 
landscape of this topic. They believe that an often-
overlooked aspect of digital literacy is finding training 
techniques that prioritize creativity. Understanding 
how to use technologies is a key first step, but being 
able to leverage them for innovation is vital to fostering 
real transformation in higher education.128 Current 
definitions of literacy only account for the gaining of 
new knowledge, skills, and attitudes, but do not include 
the deeper components of intention, reflection, and 
generativity. The addition of aptitude and creativity 
to the definition emphasizes that digital literacy is an 
iterative process that involves students learning about, 
interacting with, and then demonstrating or sharing 
their new knowledge.
Now that a deeper understanding of the topic is 
emerging, higher education institutions have recognized 
that in order to instill digital literacy in their students, 
they must better equip their faculty. While universities 
and colleges around the world have launched a number 
of professional development programs and centers, not 
all of them are entirely effective. Campus Technology 
cautions that programs with one-size-fits-all training 
approaches that assume all faculty are at the same level 
of digital literacy pose a higher risk of failure. The Director 
of the Center for Academic Technology at the University 
of the District of Columbia asserts that university leaders 
must first comprehend the wide spectrum of faculty 
IT needs before designing professional development 
opportunities. A data-driven approach that depicts 
faculty use of the university’s technology can reveal 
patterns of their literacy and help leaders to identify 
areas for improvement.129
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Governing bodies are developing guidelines for digital 
literacy to help students learn skills that will be critical 
to their success in the workplace. The Australian 
government recently established the Commonwealth 
Science Council,130 chaired by the Prime Minister, to 
advise on science and technology issues and policies 
and help the education system produce workplace-
ready graduates.131 At a local government level, the 
Massachusetts Department of Education is designing 
“Digital Literacy and Computer Science Standards” with 
25Solvable Challenge
an expert panel that consist of leaders in both K-12 and 
higher education.132 Library organizations have also 
been instrumental in creating literacy standards. The 
Association of College & Research Libraries developed 
the “Information Literacy Competency Standards for 
Higher Education,” which provide a framework to 
evaluate students’ literacy levels, including their lower 
and higher order thinking skills.133 Individual institutions 
are also creating their own standards. In the UK, The 
Open University designed the “Digital and Information 
Framework,” and emphasizes the importance of students 
learning how to collaborate with technology.134
In order for educators to better integrate digital literacy 
into curricula, they must receive ongoing training. 
It requires substantial leadership to create effective 
programs that enable busy educators to take time 
to learn new skills. St. Mary’s University of Texas, for 
example, institutionalized their faculty development 
structure, offering a yearlong program with ongoing 
follow-up workshops.135 So far, this initiative has aided 
instructors in flipping their classrooms, incorporating 
mobile devices into their curriculum, and using video 
assessment. Additionally, the St. Mary’s Faculty Institute 
includes roundtable discussions with the students to get 
a better sense of their digital literacy and technology 
use.136 Through Arcadia University, teachers have the 
opportunity to pursue a Certificate in Digital Literacy, 
which focuses on integrating technology into innovative 
pedagogies.137
Solving this challenge also calls for better digital literacy 
support for students. Cornell University developed the 
public “Digital Literacy Resources” to help their student 
body become more adept at creating media-centric 
presentations, conducting research, understanding 
intellectual property rights, and more.138 As part of 
their Mobile Development Bachelor’s Degree plan, Full 
Sail University offers a digital literacy course, teaching 
students to leverage digital tools in order to navigate, 
evaluate, create, and critically apply information.139 Many 
graduate programs are also increasingly emphasizing 
the importance of digital literacy. Medical students at 
the University of California-Irvine, for example, can enroll 
in “Health 2.0 + Digital Literacy” to learn about trends in 
healthcare technology and social media.140 Content from 
the course has been made freely available in a special 
collection in iTunes U.141

Personalizing Learning
Difficult Challenge: Those that we understand but for which solutions are elusive
P
ersonalized learning refers to the range of 
educational programs, learning experiences, 
instructional approaches, and academic-
support strategies intended to address the 
specific learning needs, interests, aspirations, 
or cultural backgrounds of individual students.142 
While there is a demand for personalized learning, it 
is not adequately supported by current technology 
or practices. The increasing focus on customizing 
instruction to meet students’ unique needs is driving the 
development of new technologies that provide more 
learner choice and allow for differentiated instruction. 
Advances such as online learning environments and 
adaptive learning technologies make it possible to 
support a learner’s individual learning path. The 
biggest barrier to personalized learning, however, is 
that scientific, data-driven approaches to effectively 
facilitate personalization have only recently begun 
to emerge; learning analytics, for example, is still 
evolving and gaining traction within higher education.
Overview
The goal of personalized learning is to enable students 
to determine the strategy and pace at which they learn. 
Though effective personalized learning strategies focus 
on the learner and not the technology, personalized 
learning may significantly draw on enabling 
technologies and tools. The underlying technologies 
needed to support personalized learning are relatively 
straightforward and readily available. For example, 
a person’s smartphone or tablet and their personal 
collection of apps directly represents their assortment 
of interests. Universities are taking advantage of mobile 
technology to meet students where they are to offer 
tailored educational content and tools. The University of 
Texas System, for example, is creating a mobile-first stack 
of technology services called TEx (Total Educational 
Experience) for use in STEM and medical science courses 
in order to improve completion rates in areas of high 
employment demand.143
Education researchers have emphasized the need 
for learning settings to be adaptable and flexible in 
order for personalized learning to take root. Students’ 
preferences and needs must be understood accurately 
before designing or implementing personalized learning 
scenarios and activities. The goal is to give the student 
the flexibility to make their learning as effective and 
efficient as possible, but adequate mentorship is still a 
clear necessity.144 Enabling technology, such as E2Coach, 
is helping to address this challenge of inadequate 
support for faculty in high-enrollment introductory 
science courses at the University of Michigan. The 
E2Coach web application delivers customized student 
websites and pushes out personalized messages about 
course content, advice on study methods and resources, 
and reminders. An evaluation on the effectiveness of 
this personalized learning tool found that users of the 
service performed better academically than nonusers by 
a notable amount.145
While the benefits of personalized learning are becoming 
increasingly clear, there is still debate on what defines 
personalized learning and an unwillingness of some 
faculty to embrace new technological advancements 
— some are concerned that the use of automated 
software for tutoring is of lesser quality than traditional 
college approaches.146 There is also a lack of research 
on the effectiveness of personalized learning in higher 
education. The assessments that exist are primarily in 
the K-12 arena and offer words of caution. A recently 
released report by the National Education Policy Center 
found that personalized instruction shows mixed results 
ranging from modest impacts to no impact at all in K-12 
settings.147
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
While scalable methods and concepts will take 
some time to refine, there is considerable consensus 
among government, policymakers, funders, and 
higher education leaders of the growing importance 
of personalized learning. The Association of Public 
and Land-grant Universities (APLU), in coordination 
with the Coalition of Urban Serving Universities, has 
awarded grants to seven universities including Florida 
International University, Georgia State University, 
University of Akron, and others, to improve student 
success through different personalized learning 
strategies. University of Akron, for example, is 
investigating how to measure, assess, and credential 
what students learn on their own, on the job, or at the 
university — by using modularized course content, 
students can test out of certain concepts, accelerating 
27Difficult Challenge
the time needed to graduate. The findings from these 
different projects are being shared beyond the cohort to 
more than 200 public universities in the APLU, helping 
to create greater awareness of best practices in this 
emerging field for action in the policy arena.148 
Early research conducted through Carnegie Mellon 
University’s Open Learning Initiative revealed that the 
intelligent tutoring characteristic of adaptive learning 
environments proved almost as effective as one-on-one 
human tutors.149 For the past few years, the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation has been leading the charge in the 
field of adaptive learning. In 2012, they announced 
that they would be allocating $9 million in grants to 
support breakthrough learning models, specifically 
investing in several organizations and institutions 
that were developing adaptive learning solutions.150 
Later that year, they established a Personal Learning 
Network, consisting of leaders at more than one dozen 
universities, colleges, and university systems in an effort 
to advance the field of adaptive learning by launching 
research initiatives and incubating pilot programs.151 
Innovations in personalizing the consumer experience 
are now being harnessed for higher education, fulfilling 
the role of academic advisor and recommender service. 
One such example is the SHERPA at Saddleback College. 
The SHERPA software uses the types of algorithms 
found in recommender services of Netflix and Amazon 
to personalize course enrollment. Student preferences, 
schedules, and courses help to create individual profiles 
that respond to their individual needs. For instance, if a 
student enters their work schedule and they encounter 
a class that is full, SHERPA suggests other classes that 
are open at an individual’s preferred times.152 Similarly, 
the bX Recommender being used at Flinders University 
in Australia is a resource that offers students article 
suggestions based on their individual area of interest. 
The service takes an article a researcher is viewing and 
displays a list of relevant articles that were accessed by 
other users of the platform.153

Teaching Complex Thinking
Difficult Challenge: Those that we understand but for which solutions are elusive
I
n today’s world, higher-order thinking is not only 
a valuable skill, but necessary for understanding 
and solving complex, real world problems. Equally 
important is the ability to communicate complex 
information surrounding global dilemmas in ways 
that are accessible to the general public. In the age 
of big data, conditions are optimal for developing 
new research processes to examine systems and our 
environment in greater depth. Massive quantities of 
data traverse the Internet every day, and many sectors 
are tapping into these myriad data sets to decipher 
and resolve complex issues. As a result, demand for 
data specialists is expected to rise by 243% over the 
next five years in the UK alone, according to SAS.154 In 
this environment, institutions have a responsibility to 
prepare learners to take advantage of the latest tools 
and techniques to help them tackle complex problems 
and influence systemic change through their mode 
of communication. Other emerging technologies 
including semantic web and modeling software, 
among other innovations, are contributing to the 
experimental conditions that have the potential to 
train learners in complex and systems thinking.
Overview
The term “complex thinking” refers to the ability to 
understand complexity, or to comprehend how systems 
work in order to solve problems.155 Complex thinking is 
the application of systems thinking, which is the capacity 
to decipher how individual components work together 
as part of a whole, dynamic unit that creates patterns 
over time.156 Computational thinking is another higher-
order thinking skill that complements complex thinking, 
and it entails logical analysis and organization of data; 
modeling, abstractions, and simulations; and identifying, 
testing, and implementing possible solutions.157 
Emphasis on these approaches in education is helping 
equip learners with essential skills for deciphering the 
real-world systems and solving complex problems 
on a global scale. The difficulty in this challenge is in 
introducing complex thinking to students that have not 
yet had exposure to these modes of problem-solving 
along with related communication techniques.
Making complex ideas digestible for students has 
become easier with the use of innovative approaches 
such as data visualization, also referred to as infographics, 
a form of visual communication that coveys a succinct 
narrative. This method of data analysis and presentation 
has moved beyond the sciences to a more mainstream 
platform — journalism. Data journalism is an emerging 
field that leverages data visualization and engaging 
infographics to tell compelling stories, and the Open 
Knowledge Foundation and the European Journalism 
Centre who partnered to produce The Data Journalism 
Handbook in 2011 have formalized its use.158 With over 70 
contributors sourced from universities and media firms 
from around the world, The Data Journalism Handbook 
includes chapters about the symbiotic relationship 
between journalists and coders, the various methods of 
gathering and presenting data, as well as a range of case 
studies to support this mode of storytelling. 
Creating compelling presentations is also becoming 
more important to scientists and researchers at 
universities, as they are increasingly expected to be 
able to communicate their findings and connect with 
the public. A growing number of universities have 
established programs that are focused on developing 
young scientists in this area. Typically guided by an 
artistic director or acting coach, learners are taught 
improvisational techniques that encourage relaxed 
communication and positive attitudes about failure. The 
Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony 
Brook University has pioneered instruction in this area. 
Located within the Stony Brook School of Journalism, 
the project has been helping young scientists deliver 
on their responsibility of sharing the meaning and 
implications of their work since 2009.159
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Encouraging complex thinking and communication is 
challenging because educators have only just started 
articulating this multifaceted need in higher education. 
PBS’s Media Shift coordinated educators from University 
of Miami, Columbia University, Temple University, 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and technology 
contributors from The New York Times to discuss the 
rising importance of integrating data visualization 
into journalism education.160 Via a Twitter-mediated 
discussion, these leaders touched on the power of 
visualization to reveal patterns that are shrouded in 
complexity and data. Commentators also remarked 
29Difficult Challenge
on data visualization’s ability to convey complex 
relationships to the public that are not possible through 
traditional forms of reporting. Dialogs like this are paving 
the way for policies in support of integrating complex 
thinking and communication into core activities. 
Much of the difficulty of this challenge lies in the 
diversity and intricacy of the skills it entails, which means 
there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some institutions, 
however, are developing specialized schools of thought 
to address complex problem-solving and systemic 
change. In 2012, Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner 
Institute of Design launched the d.school fellowship 
program, which invites burgeoning and experienced 
professionals to learn formal design-thinking processes 
as they develop human-centric solutions that influence 
systems-level impact in their areas of expertise. 
Supported by instruction and resources from Stanford 
and Silicon Valley, the fellows represent a diverse group 
of multidisciplinary thinkers with strong communication 
skills. Among the 2014-15 d.school fellows are journalists, 
artists, educators, and public servants that have 
developed prototypes for innovative organizational 
models they intend to reinforce through systems and 
design-thinking processes.161 
Some departmental leaders are emphasizing communi-
cation as an integral skill for scientists, and have made 
significant progress on this front for their institutions. 
Robert Bazell, a molecular, cellular, and developmental 
virology professor at Yale University was instrumental in 
the development and implementation of a novel, four-
course program at his institution for postdoctoral and 
graduate students in the sciences that focus on presen-
tation and public speaking. Bazell, the former chief sci-
ence and health correspondent for NBC News, said that 
he was intent on starting the program to develop Yale’s 
emerging scientists as competent communicators.162 
Focused on improvisation and acting games, the ses-
sions have earned positive feedback from the students 
who have expressed their satisfaction with gaining new-
found perspectives and understanding of their fields.

Competing Models of Education
Wicked Challenge: Those that are complex to even define, much less address
N
ew models of education are bringing 
unprecedented competition to the traditional 
models of higher education where students 
typically receive instruction by faculty or 
teaching assistants per credit hour over four 
years, on-campus. Across the board, institutions are 
looking for ways to provide a high quality of service and 
more learning opportunities at lower costs.163 While 
massive open online courses are at the forefront of 
these discussions, a range of adult learning programs 
are creating innovative models that emphasize 
human interaction and multidimensional learning 
by cultivating 21st century skills such as intercultural 
communication and social entrepreneurship.164 
Additionally, competency-based education, which 
tracks student skills instead of credit hours, is 
emerging to disrupt existing credit-hour systems.165 
As these new platforms arise, there is a growing 
need to frankly evaluate the models and determine 
how to best support collaboration, interaction, and 
assessment at scale. It is clear that simply capitalizing 
on new technology is not enough; the new models 
must use these tools and services to engage students 
on a deeper level.
Overview
With free and low-cost, high-quality content accessible 
via the Internet, both formal and informal online learning 
is becoming increasingly widespread, which some fear 
could dampen the appeal of traditional higher education 
degrees and institutions. MOOCs have surfaced as one 
of the highest profile examples of a competing model. 
While MOOCs have experienced a meteoric rise followed 
by skepticism, experts believe that they will continue to 
be a potent disruptive technology that will jeopardize 
the futures of many inefficient universities. The rising cost 
of private and public university tuition is compounding 
this challenge, making students rethink the value of a 
traditional college education across the globe.166 New 
models that provide both the opportunity to save 
money and progress more quickly through degree 
programs will become increasingly sought after.167 
Interest in competency-based degree programs, which 
allow for more flexible and personalized degree options, 
is on the rise. According to EDUCAUSE, competency-
based education provides academic credit for the 
mastery of clearly defined competencies, and it leverages 
the potential of online learning by saving students time 
and money.168 Northern Arizona University is one of a 
handful of online competency-based programs that 
enables students to earn degrees through self-paced 
modules and assessment rather than in traditional 
semester-long programs. Capella University also offers 
FlexPath degree programs for Business, Information 
Technology, and Psychology. FlexPath is a style of 
learning that allows students to work at their own 
pace and spend more time working through new and 
challenging material by recognizing knowledge already 
gained on the job.169 The appeal of these more flexible 
models is how the degrees are earned — as direct-
assessment degrees, students receive competencies 
rather than credits. Along with their credit equivalencies, 
students must pass a summative assessment that is 
based on their learning portfolio.170 
Experimentation using alternative models of learning is 
beginning to increase in both size and type to address 
challenges related to high costs, deficient student 
engagement, and unsatisfactory student graduation 
rates in higher education.171 Three examples include 
Northeastern University’s cooperative education 
courses that offer on-the-job experience,172 Western 
Governors University competency-based education that 
involves the combination of expertise in both industry 
knowledge and academics,173 and Florida College 
System’s meta-majors or pathways that are a collection 
of related content aligned with potential academic 
and career goals.174 Critics caution that there is a need 
to examine these new approaches through a critical 
lens to ensure they are effective and provide long-term 
benefits equivalent to a traditional higher education 
experience.175
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Competition from new pedagogies is not likely to foster 
widespread change unless there is regulatory reform in 
the political arena. While the general sentiment is that 
the US federal government has been primarily hands-off, 
existing regulatory barriers such as accreditation, state 
authorization regulations for distance learning, and 
federal financial aid eligibility rules still favor traditional 
institutions of higher education. In the US, recent actions 
31Wicked Challenge
by the President and US Department of Education 
in redefining the credit hour to include amount of 
work represented by learning outcomes is a step 
forward, helping foster the growth of these innovative 
approaches.176 While there is a more supportive 
environment in the US, there is concern in India that 
over-regulation is stifling innovation and impeding the 
growth of online courses there. Government leaders 
there cite that ensuring quality control is the main 
obstacle, while businesses such as Coursera argue that 
MOOCs should be embraced and allowed to flourish 
because they do a better job at preparing students for 
the workforce.177
Increasing workforce preparedness has been cited 
as one of the forces encouraging more innovative 
pedagogical models, and projects such as Liverpool 
John Moores University’s World of Work program is 
serving as a leader in this area. As one of the UK’s new 
generation universities, the research university stresses 
work-related learning and skill development through 
the involvement of business experts from leading 
organizations such as Airbus, Ford Europe, and Sony. 
Students develop a set of skills that are verified through 
an employer-approved Skills Statement and interview 
during the course of their studies. Quest University in 
Canada is a lauded example of how institutions are 
engaging students at a deeper level. During the first two 
years of study, students complete the same foundational 
courses in a seminar-discussion format then select 
individual learning paths based on their personal 
interests and passion. There are no grades or lectures at 
Quest University; instead students receive check marks 
to indicate they are engaged in their learning.178 
Online learning is helping to facilitate entire new areas 
of focus and growth beyond MOOCs at global higher 
education institutions. Minerva University, for example, 
is a radically different university that focuses on key 
skill building in various cities instead of information 
transferring on a single campus. The university recently 
took in its first cohort of 33 students from different parts 
of the world — they do not take classes, but engage in 
intensive interactive online seminars. Students begin 
their journey their first year in California, then spend 
each semester in a different city around the world where 
they use the cities’ infrastructures to explore and create 
their own university experiences.179 Creating a new 
model that reduces geographical barriers and exposes 
students to global issues is also the focus of the work 
of Aga Khan University and University of Toronto. They 
have recently begun using blended learning strategies 
to connect students from different backgrounds and 
expose them to challenges facing the global health 
community.180

Rewarding Teaching
Wicked Challenge: Those that are complex to even define, much less address
T
eaching is often rated lower than research in 
academia. In the global education marketplace, 
a university’s status is largely determined on 
the quantity and quality of its research. In the 
Times Higher Education’s World University 
Rankings methodology, an institution’s research 
influence is the single most influential indicator out 
of their 13 criteria.181 There is an overarching sense 
in the academic world that research credentials are 
a more valuable asset than talent and skill as an 
instructor. Because of this way of thinking, efforts 
to implement effective pedagogies are lacking. 
Adjunct professors and students feel the brunt of this 
challenge, as teaching-only contracts are underrated 
and underpaid, and learners are subject to the 
outdated teaching styles of the university’s primary 
researchers. Overemphasis on research has caused 
a number of negative ramifications, including an 
excessive dependence on part-time faculty, which 
has diminished mobility within higher education, 
complicating the dilemma even further.182
Overview
It is largely understood that when university 
administrators are considering candidates for tenured, 
full-time positions, extent of research is weighted more 
heavily than student evaluations or effectiveness of 
instruction.183 This is the result of a higher education 
system in which funding and prestige are derived from 
an institution’s scholarly imprint, which has created 
an inhospitable environment for educators who like 
to teach.184 The Guardian explored this dilemma in the 
context of the EU where universities are competing to 
earn funding from the Research Excellence Framework 
(REF), an initiative of the UK government that will provide 
funding to institutions with outstanding rankings. 
Because of REF, universities are putting pressure on 
faculty to publish research, invoking negative reactions 
among professors and teaching fellows who believe that 
quality of instruction is undervalued.185 
One of the effects of this wicked challenge is that reliance 
on part-time faculty has increased substantially, but this 
is not necessarily a benefit for adjunct instructors. More 
and more American universities are favoring part-time 
employment over long-term, tenured positions.186 A 
2014 report by the American Association of University 
Professors showed that adjunct professors comprise 
76.4% of US faculty across institutions, from liberal 
arts colleges to research universities to community 
colleges.187 This challenge has engendered a struggle 
for teachers in higher education. The Atlantic recently 
covered a labor movement that has coalesced as more 
part-time professors find themselves living below the 
poverty line and working between several colleges. 
The affected instructors are calling for systemic change 
that will allow them mobility in higher education, 
which requires time, space, and resources to develop as 
educators and scholars. 
The roots of this issue are interwoven with past trends in 
university funding, which have generated a host of neg-
ative consequences. According to Jeffrey Selingo, author 
of College (Un)Bound: The Future of Higher Education and 
What It Means for Students, changes in hiring practic-
es have been caused by shifting priorities of university 
administrators.188 As the competition among colleges 
in the US grows fiercer, universities have focused fund-
ing on improving student services and amenities over 
improving teaching and learning within the classroom. 
Moreover, in a recent commentary for The Chronicle on 
Higher Education, Selingo points to this “mission creep” 
as a result of institutions trying to gain prestige by inflat-
ing their degree offerings to justify increases in tuition 
and the hiring of more administration. These funding 
trends have affected students at regional public colleges 
the most because they are expected to pay more for a 
mediocre graduate experience that fails to live up to the 
quality of its associated flagship research university.189
Implications for Policy, Leadership, or 
Practice
Acknowledgement of the issue at a national level has 
offered a starting point for addressing this complex issue. 
The EU has recognized this multifaceted dilemma in the 
2013 “Report to the European Commission on Improving 
the Quality of Teaching and Learning in Europe’s Higher 
Education Institutions,” which laid out three main points 
of this challenge: the need to prioritize teaching and 
learning over research, the importance of training 
faculty members to teach at a first-rate standard, and for 
policymakers and thought leaders to push institutions 
of higher education to reevaluate their missions so that 
teaching is a keystone.190 The Australian government 
33Wicked Challenge
has also recognized the quality of learning experiences 
in higher education by allocating grant funds from 
their 2014-2015 Department of Education and Training 
Budget to the Promotion of Excellence in Learning and 
Teaching in Higher Education.191 
There are a number of institutions that have taken the lead 
in improving and prioritizing the quality of instruction. 
At the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and 
Educational Innovation, professors at Carnegie Mellon 
University are selected for the Spotlight on Innovative 
Teaching, a semester-long period of recognition where 
they host workshops to impart their techniques to other 
educators.192 In Canada, administrators at York University 
plan to hire over 200 faculty members that will be 
teaching-focused. While the workload balance between 
research and instruction is more even in Canadian higher 
education, administrations have justified the need to 
create more teaching-centered positions, especially in 
regional public universities rather than flagship research 
institutions. It is important to point out that for Canadian 
universities, teaching-focused faculty are offered 
comparable pay, benefits, and tenure.193
Overemphasis on research can be corrected within the 
classroom, through the use of more effective pedagogies, 
which are often adopted at the departmental level. At 
The University of Texas, instructors in the Department 
of Mathematics have turned to inquiry-based learning 
(IBL) to help students become active generators of 
mathematical concepts instead of passive consumers 
of lectures. Since their initial success with Number 
Theory, the department now employs IBL across a 
range of mathematics courses.194 Similarly, the flipped 
classroom promotes hands-on learning and interaction 
during class, and has been adopted by faculty at the 
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering 
(ECE) at the University of Utah. In discussing the hype 
surrounding this method of instruction, an ECE educator 
commented that the flipped classroom is simply an 
application of technology that enables high-quality 
teaching practices.195

34 NMC Horizon Report: 2015 Higher Education Edition
Important Developments in Educational Technology for 
Higher Education
E
ach of the six developments in educational 
technology detailed in this section were selected 
by the project’s expert panel using the Horizon 
Project’s Delphi-based process of iterative rounds 
of study, discussion, and voting. In the NMC 
Horizon Project, educational technology is defined 
in a broad sense as tools and resources that are used 
to improve teaching, learning, and creative inquiry. 
While many of the technologies considered were not 
developed for the sole purpose of education, they have 
clear applications in the field.
The technologies, which the members of the expert 
panel agreed are very likely to drive technology 
planning and decision-making over the next five 
years, are sorted into three time-related categories — 
near-term technologies that are expected to achieve 
widespread adoption in one year or less; mid-term 
technologies that will take two to three years; and far-
term technologies, which are forecasted to enter the 
mainstream of education within four to five years. Each 
technology topic opens with an overview of the topic.
The initial list of topics considered by the expert panel 
was arranged into categories that were based on the 
primary origin and use of the technology. The potential 
applications of the technologies featured, specifically in 
the context of global higher education, were considered 
in a series of online discussions that can be viewed at 
horizon.wiki.nmc.org/Horizon+Topics.
The expert panel was provided with an extensive set 
of background materials when the project began 
that identified and documented a range of existing 
technologies used in both education and beyond. 
The panel was also encouraged to consider emerging 
technologies whose applications for higher education 
institutions may still be distant. A key criterion for the 
inclusion of a new technology in this edition was its 
potential relevance to teaching, learning, and creative 
inquiry in higher education.
In the first round of voting, the expert group reduced the 
master set, shown on the next page, to 12 technologies 
that were then researched in much greater depth by 
the NMC staff. Each was then written up in the format 
of the NMC Horizon Report and used to inform the final 
round of voting. Technologies that do not make the 
interim results or the final report are often thoroughly 
discussed on the project wiki at horizon.wiki.nmc.org. 
Sometimes a candidate technology does not get voted 
in because the expert panel believes it is already in 
widespread use in higher education, or, in other cases, 
they believe the technology is more than five years 
away from widespread adoption. Some technologies, 
while intriguing, do not have enough credible project 
examples to substantiate them. 
There are currently seven categories of technologies, 
tools, and strategies for their use that the NMC monitors 
continuously. These are not a closed set, but rather are 
intended to provide a way to illustrate and organize 
emerging technologies into pathways of development 
that are or may be relevant to learning and creative 
inquiry. The list of seven categories has proven fairly 
consistent, but new technologies are added within 
these categories in almost every research cycle; others 
are merged or updated. Collectively, the categories 
serve as lenses for thinking about innovation; each is 
defined below.
> Consumer technologies are tools created for recre-
ational and professional purposes and were not de-
signed, at least initially, for educational use — though 
they may serve well as learning aids and be quite 
adaptable for use in universities and colleges. These 
technologies find their ways into institutions because 
people are using them at home or in other settings.
> Digital strategies are not so much technologies as 
they are ways of using devices and software to enrich 
teaching and learning, whether inside or outside of 
the classroom. Effective digital strategies can be used 
in both formal and informal learning; what makes 
them interesting is that they transcend conventional 
ideas to create something that feels new, meaningful, 
and 21st century. 
> Enabling technologies are those technologies that 
have the potential to transform what we expect of our 
devices and tools. The link to learning in this category 
is less easy to make, but this group of technologies 
is where substantive technological innovation begins 
to be visible. Enabling technologies expand the reach 
of our tools, make them more capable and useful, and 
often easier to use as well.
35
> Internet technologies include techniques and 
essential infrastructure that help to make the 
technologies underlying how we interact with the 
network more transparent, less obtrusive, and easier 
to use.
> Learning technologies include both tools and 
resources developed expressly for the education 
sector, as well as pathways of development that 
may include tools adapted from other purposes 
that are matched with strategies to make them 
useful for learning. These include technologies that 
are changing the landscape of learning, whether 
formal or informal, by making it more accessible and 
personalized. 
> Social media technologies could have been 
subsumed under the consumer technology category, 
but they have become so ever-present and so widely 
used in every part of society that they have been 
elevated to their own category. As well established as 
social media is, it continues to evolve at a rapid pace, 
with new ideas, tools, and developments coming 
online constantly. 
Important Developments in Educational Technology for Higher Education
> Visualization technologies run the gamut from 
simple infographics to complex forms of visual data 
analysis. What they have in common is that they tap 
the brain’s inherent ability to rapidly process visual 
information, identify patterns, and sense order in 
complex situations. These technologies are a growing 
cluster of tools and processes for mining large data 
sets, exploring dynamic processes, and generally 
making the complex simple. 
The following pages provide a discussion of the six 
technologies highlighted by the 2015 Higher Education 
Expert Panel, who agree that they have the potential 
to foster real changes in education, particularly in the 
development of progressive pedagogies and learning 
strategies; the organization of teachers’ work; and the 
arrangement and delivery of content. As such, each 
section includes an overview of the technology; a 
discussion of its relevance to teaching, learning, or 
creative inquiry; and curated project examples and 
recommendations for further reading.

Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: One Year or Less
B
YOD, also referred to as BYOT (Bring Your 
Own Technology), refers to the practice of 
people bringing their own laptops, tablets, 
smartphones, or other mobile devices with 
them to the learning or work environment. Intel 
coined the term in 2009, when the company observed 
that an increasing number of its employees were 
using their own devices and connecting them to the 
corporate network. Since implementing BYOD policies, 
the company has reported up to 5 million hours of 
annual productivity gains, a statistic that is compelling 
many other companies to consider BYOD.196 In higher 
education, the BYOD movement addresses the same 
reality; many students are entering the classroom 
with their own devices, which they use to connect 
to the institutions’ networks. While BYOD policies 
have been shown to reduce overall technology 
spending, they are gaining traction more so because 
they reflect the contemporary lifestyle and way of 
working. A 2013 Cisco Partner Network Study found 
that BYOD practices are becoming more common 
across industries, particularly in education; over 95% 
of educators surveyed responded that they use their 
own device for work purposes.197 Although higher 
education institutions have cited IT security concerns, 
technology gap issues, and platform neutrality as 
challenges to the uptake of this technology, a growing 
number of models in practice are paving the way for 
BYOD to enter the mainstream.
Overview
The link between the use of personal devices and 
increases in productivity gets stronger each passing 
year as more organizations adopt BYOD policies. The 
integration of personal smartphones, tablets, and PCs 
into the workflow supports an on-the-go mentality, 
changing the nature of work and learning activities so 
that they can happen anywhere, at anytime. Employers 
and higher education institutions are finding that when 
given the opportunity to choose their device, users are 
saved from the effort and time needed to get accustomed 
to new devices and can therefore accomplish tasks with 
more ease and efficiency. A recent study by Gartner 
predicted that by 2017, half of the world’s employers will 
expect their employees to supply their own device for 
work.198
Adoption of BYOD policy into the corporate sphere 
has provided a model for educational contexts, and 
the practice is gaining acceptance in universities and 
colleges all over the world. The latest “College Explorer” 
study from re:fuel reveals that on average, college 
students spend more than 3.5 hours per day using their 
mobile phones,199 and Information Week reports that 
students own an average of 2.7 devices.200 Using this 
technology has become an essential part of the learning 
process; a study at California State University found that 
students could only engage in educational activities for 
six minutes before turning to their devices for support.201 
Devices have become the gateways to personal working 
and learning environments that facilitate the exploration 
of new subjects at a pace that is unique to each learner. 
BYOD proponents at Griffith University in Australia cite 
personal mobile device use as a way for students to 
engage with learning material more effectively; they 
have instant access to more resources to gain a better 
understanding of the subjects at hand.202 The BYOD 
movement is enabling students to learn using the 
technology with which they are already familiar and 
comfortable. Universities and colleges are following suit 
as a Bradford Network Study revealed that 85% of the 
responding educational institutions allow faculty and 
students to use their own devices on campus, and 52% 
said that those devices are being integrated into the class 
experience.203 However, discussions around the topic 
have raised concerns regarding a digital divide — some 
pundits caution that BYOD could alienate students who 
cannot afford the latest technologies. To alleviate this 
issue, several institutions purchase tablets for all students 
who need them, including Bethel University, Seton 
Hill University, and Illinois Institute of Technology.204 
Södertörn University in Sweden provides 13,000 students 
and 850 staff with access to both PCs and Macs.205
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
For higher education institutions, often BYOD is less 
about the devices and more about the personalized 
content that users have loaded onto them. Rarely do 
two devices share the same content or settings, and 
BYOD enables students and educators to leverage the 
tools that make them most efficient. In many cases, their 
devices are already populated with productivity apps, 
37Time-to-Adoption Horizon: One Year or Less
such as Skitch206 and iTunes U,207 helping them to better 
organize their notes, syllabi, and schedules on campus 
and beyond. Furthermore, instructors can leverage this 
mobile device use by implementing polling and other 
interactive features during class. At Manchester Medical 
School, students use iPads during class to annotate 
instructors’ slides, record lectures, take notes, and create 
mind maps to illustrate their understanding of complex 
topics. Students are also able to share documents with 
each other more easily through the Dropbox app.208 In 
a do-it-yourself manner, biology students at Missouri 
University of Science and Technology are using their 
smartphones, along with cheap plywood, Plexiglass, and 
LED laser pointers to design their own microscopes to 
use for lab work.209
Higher education institutions are increasingly updating 
their IT infrastructures to accommodate BYOD policies. 
University College London, for example, is home to a 
dedicated IT service desk that helps connect students 
to their wireless network, Eduroam.210 However, one 
of the inherent challenges in the growing BYOD trend 
is facilitating learning environments that are device-
agnostic; when students have the flexibility to use the 
technology of their choosing, sufficient infrastructure 
must be in place to support devices of all kinds. 
University CTOs are being tasked with forging solutions. 
In an article from Higher Ed Tech Decisions, campus IT 
experts provided critical tips for success, including the 
need for more radio waves within the wireless access 
points and focusing on devising BYOD policies well 
ahead of deployment.211 
EDUCAUSE has published BYOD considerations for 
higher education, emphasizing best practices for 
secure networks, systems, and sensitive data. The CIO 
of Roche Diagnostics asserts that creating effective 
BYOD policy is less about the technology and more 
about understanding and anticipating the needs 
and behaviors of students and faculty.212 In 2014, the 
University of Scranton published their BYOD strategy, 
which outlined their plans for students to access virtual 
laboratories through their mobile devices. Additionally, 
they believe implementing BYOD will foster better 
hybrid learning models, allowing faculty and students 
to both capture and access lectures online. University 
of Scranton leaders assert that BYOD policies will also 
impact the physical environment of the classroom, and 
that rigid furniture should be replaced with more flexible 
workspaces to accommodate the collaboration that 
mobile apps and other features promote.213

Flipped Classroom
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: One Year or Less
T
he flipped classroom refers to a model of 
learning that rearranges how time is spent 
both in and out of class to shift the ownership 
of learning from the educators to the students. 
In the flipped classroom model, valuable class 
time is devoted to higher cognitive, more active, 
project-based learning where students work together 
to solve local or global challenges — or other real-
world applications — to gain a deeper understanding 
of the subject. Rather than the instructor using class 
time to dispense information, that work is done by 
each student after class, and could take the form 
of watching video lectures, listening to podcasts, 
perusing enhanced e-book content, or collaborating 
with peers in online communities.214 Students access 
the online tools and resources any time they need 
them. Faculty can then devote more time to interacting 
with each individual. After class, students manage the 
content they use, the pace and style of learning, and 
the ways in which they demonstrate their knowledge; 
the instructor adapts instructional and collaborative 
approaches to suit their learning needs and personal 
learning journeys.
Overview
The flipped classroom model is part of a larger 
pedagogical movement that overlaps with blended 
learning, inquiry-based learning, and other instructional 
approaches and tools that are meant to be flexible, 
active, and more engaging for students. The first well-
documented example of the flipped classroom was in 
2007 when two chemistry teachers at Woodland Park 
High School in Colorado wanted to address the issue of 
students missing class when they were traveling to and 
from school activities. Students were struggling to keep 
up with their work. The teachers experimented with 
using screen capture software and PowerPoint to record 
live lessons and post them on YouTube. They immediately 
observed a dramatic change in the classroom: the focus 
shifted to increasing interactions and fostering deeper 
connections between them and their students, as well 
as between students.215
Eight years after the first iteration of flipped learning, 
educators all over the world have successfully adopted 
the model. Whereas many learning technology 
trends first take off in higher education before seeing 
applications in schools, the flipped classroom reflects 
an opposite trajectory. Today, many universities and 
colleges are increasingly embracing this approach. 
Flipped learning is seen as especially suited for higher 
education because the rearranging of class time gives 
students in large introductory lecture courses more 
opportunity to engage and interact with their peers. 
Instructors also make more efficient use of their time 
by focusing on content that is especially challenging for 
students — handheld clickers in large seminars are often 
paired with this method in order to help understand 
students’ comprehension of material and customize 
discussions accordingly.216
The flipped classroom is seeing its most widespread use 
in the US. The Center for Digital Education’s survey of 
higher education instructors found that 29% of faculty 
were using the flipped classroom and another 27% 
said they planned to use it within a year.217 Cultural 
differences may contribute to the lack of mainstream 
adoption worldwide. In the report, “The Flipped 
Classroom: Viewpoints in Asian Universities,” researchers 
claim that Western and Eastern differences in learning 
styles may explain why the model is still in infancy in 
Asian countries. The flipped classroom requires a lot 
of autonomous work, which may be disorienting to 
students who prefer to rely on the teacher as the leading 
source of information.218
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
The flipped classroom can invoke a broad spectrum 
of implementation — from an instructor integrating 
several minutes of hands-on learning in exchange for 
less lecture time to designing an entire course where 
content is delivered through video lectures or pre-class 
readings, with class time used solely for group work 
activities. To help both researchers and practitioners 
make sense of this vast landscape, there is a growing 
array of resources available. The Flipped Learning 
Network is an organization working to help define and 
differentiate flipped learning approaches by providing 
an analysis of research studies, archived webinars, 
examples of instructor videos, and more.219 Additionally, 
at the institution level, Cornell University’s Center for 
Teaching Excellence provides resources on their website 
that detail how instructors can flip their classroom, what 
39
types of learning and assessment opportunities can be 
accomplished, and who to contact on campus to consult 
on flipping a particular course.220 
Beyond watching recorded video lectures, other 
technologies such as e-books with collaborative 
annotation and discussion software enable instructors 
to be more in tune with their students’ learning patterns. 
By reviewing the comments and questions that students 
pose online, instructors can better prepare for class and 
address particularly challenging ideas. The learning 
environment transforms into a dynamic and more social 
space where students can participate in critiques or 
work through problems in teams. A Columbia University 
biochemistry professor flipped his large lecture course 
because of the troubling number of students who came 
to class unprepared. His strategy was to create weekly 
PowerPoint presentations paired with screen-recording 
software ScreenFlow and post them to YouTube and 
his learning management system. Using embedded 
quizzes, he could ensure that the students would come 
to class ready to engage in livelier discussions.221 
While there is little national research on the effectiveness 
of the flipped classroom model as compared with 
traditional lectures, there are several experiments 
underway that are helping to establish a valuable 
baseline. Villanova University piloted four flipped 
introductory engineering classes in 2013 that were so 
successful that they ran eight additional flipped classes in 
the fall of 2014. Students in the bottom third performed 
on average seven percentage points better than their 
counterparts in a traditional classroom.222 Faculty at 
Harvey Mudd College are currently in the second year of 
a four-year controlled study comparing active learning 
lecture classes in flipped classrooms in engineering 
and math courses. While preliminary results show no 
significant difference in learning, metacognitive, or 
affective gains, students reported preferring the flipped 
classroom model because they had access to lectures 
online and could replay sections they did not understand. 
While class subject might be a factor in the success of the 
project, more data is needed to verify this hypothesis.223

Makerspaces
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
T
he turn of the 21st century has signaled a 
shift in what types of skillsets have real, 
applicable value in a rapidly advancing 
world.  In this landscape, creativity, design, 
and engineering are making their way to the 
forefront of educational considerations, as tools such 
as 3D printers, robotics, and 3D modeling web-based 
applications become accessible to more people. 
Proponents of makerspaces for education highlight 
the benefit of engaging learners in creative, higher-
order problem solving through hands-on design, 
construction, and iteration.224 The question of how to 
renovate or repurpose classrooms to address the needs 
of the future is being answered through the concept 
of makerspaces, or workshops that offer tools and 
the learning experiences needed to help people carry 
out their ideas. Makerspaces are intended to appeal 
to people of all ages, and are founded on openness 
to experiment, iterate, and create. The driving force 
behind makerspaces is rooted in the maker movement, 
a following comprised of artists, tech enthusiasts, 
engineers, builders, tinkerers, and anyone else with 
a passion for making things.225 The foundation of the 
maker movement was built on the success of the Maker 
Faire, a gathering that launched in 2006 and has since 
propagated itself into numerous community-driven 
events all over the world.226
Overview
Makerspaces, also referred to as hackerspaces, hack 
labs, or fab labs, are community-oriented workshops 
where tech enthusiasts meet regularly to share and 
explore electronic hardware, manufacturing tools, and 
programming techniques and tricks.227 Much of the 
hype around this cultural trend burgeoned around 3D 
MakerBot printers, a rapid-prototyping technology 
that requires a DIY mentality to assemble, operate, and 
replicate it.228 Other tools that are commonly found 
in makerspaces include laser cutters, soldering irons, 
Legos, Arduinos and Raspberry Pi computers, and 
circuitry gadgets, among others.  Whatever the supplies, 
the overarching goal of a makerspace is to be a place 
where people are free to experiment and make things, 
on their own, and as part of a productive community. 
Widespread enthusiasm behind makerspaces is steadily 
growing. Dale Dougherty, the CEO of Maker Media, 
Editor of Make magazine, and creator of Maker Faire, is 
a major advocate of installing makerspaces into learning 
environments and has been helping put the concept 
at the forefront of national discussions. This year, the 
White House hosted its first ever Maker Faire, leading 
President Obama to publicly highlight the power of DIY 
to revolutionize American manufacturing and stoke 
innovation and job growth.229 During a recent talk at ISTE 
2014, Dougherty related his experience of bringing the 
Maker Faire to the White House, and described “making” 
as a universal language of learning and discovery.230 
Dougherty continues to educate the public about 
makerspaces and maker culture in schools, college 
campuses, and communities everywhere.    
Makerspaces are becoming a more relevant part of 
cultural and economic discussions, and universities are 
taking notice. Florida Polytechnic University, a STEM-
focused college and new school of the State University 
System of Florida, recently partnered with MakerBot 
3D Printing. Its inaugural class is already benefitting 
from the Innovation, Science, and Technology building, 
a state-of-the art facility that is home to the Rapid 
Application Development (RAD) makerspace, which is 
equipped with 55 MakerBot 3D Printers and Scanners.231 
The Plymouth College of Art administration has entered 
a partnership with Europe’s leading fab labs as part of 
the Made@EU project in order to design a program of 
workshops and residencies that will facilitate exchange 
of ideas across borders. In the Fab Lab Plymouth, 
students and members of the community can freely 
access 3D printers and scanners, CNC milling machines, 
a CNC router, a laser cutter, and a vinyl cutter.232
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
Institutions are taking advantage of makerspaces to 
provide students and faculty a place that is integrated 
into the community to do their tinkering. Sierra College 
in Rocklin has partnered with the Hacker Lab of 
Sacramento, California to open a co-working makerspace 
that offers office space at accessible month-to-month 
rates. The Sierra Joint Community College District 
President commented that the makerspace’s downtown 
location makes it more accessible to members of the 
community beyond the university, including local start-
ups and small businesses.233 In a similar agreement, the 
41Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
Nova Scotia College of Art & Design (NSCAD) worked 
with the Halifax Makerspace to create a place on campus 
that can be accessed by the entire community.234 
Located in the NSCAD Institute for Applied Creativity 
on the Halifax Seaport, the makerspace invites students, 
faculty, retired people, high schoolers, and everyone in 
between to enjoy the space and take advantage of a 
room full of tools.235 
A growing number of universities have established 
makerspaces as interdisciplinary hubs where students 
can experiment with computer-assisted design (CAD) 
software and invent products. At the University of 
Nairobi’s Science and Technology Park, a first-year 
electrical engineering student has invented and 
prototyped a 3D printed device that will help doctors 
place intravenous needles accurately on infant children. 
The student carried out this process in the university’s 
fab lab, which is one of three in Kenya.236 A Turkish 
design student created an award-winning 3D printed 
lightweight cast called The Osteoid that incorporates an 
ultrasound system to stimulate bone growth.237 
Substantial discussions are taking place about 
how makerspaces can bolster not only science and 
engineering departments, but media and journalism 
schools as well. PBS EducationShift interviewed faculty 
members from higher education institutions that are 
creating makerspaces to support the production of 
digital media and other storytelling activities. Currently, 
West Virginia University is in the process of designing 
the Media and Innovation Center that will feature 
a makerspace, a digital storytelling lab, spaces for 
collaboration, and an augmented reality studio. Houston 
Community College is working on a similar project, the 
West Houston Institute, which is a dedicated building 
that will have active learning classrooms and support 
for media production.  These makerspaces share the 
common goal of being a collaborative workspace where 
learners from every discipline can feel comfortable 
learning skills outside of the curriculum and engage in 
meaningful learning.238

Wearable Technology
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
W
earable technology refers to computer-
based devices that can be worn by 
users, taking the form of an accessory 
such as jewelry, eyewear, or even actual 
items of clothing such as shoes or a 
jacket. The benefit of wearable technology is that 
it can conveniently integrate tools that track sleep, 
movement, location, and social media interactions or 
it can enable virtual reality. There are even new classes 
of devices that are seamlessly integrated with a user’s 
everyday life and movements. Google Glass is one of 
the best known, enabling users to see information 
about their surroundings displayed in front of them. 
Smart watches from Samsung, Sony, and Pebble are 
already allowing users to check emails and perform 
other productive tasks through a tiny interface. A 
rapidly growing category of wearable technology 
takes advantage of the burgeoning interest in the 
“quantified self.” Jawbone, Nike, and Fitbit bracelets 
are three product examples accounting for 97% of 
all smartphone-enabled tracker sales that monitor 
how people eat, sleep, and move.239 Empowered by 
these insights, many individuals now rely on these 
technologies to improve their lifestyle and health. 
Today’s wearables not only track where a person goes, 
what they do, and how much time they spend doing it, 
but now what their aspirations are and when those can 
be accomplished.
Overview
Wearable technology is not a new category; one of 
the most popular early incarnations of the technology 
was HP’s calculator watch, which was introduced in the 
1980s.240 Since then, the field has advanced significantly, 
but the overarching theme behind the technology 
remains the same — convenience. Portable, lightweight, 
and often taking the place of an accessory that the user 
already has, wearable tools are meant to go anywhere. 
Effective wearable devices become an extension of the 
person wearing them, allowing them to comfortably 
engage in everyday activities, such as checking 
and responding to emails and other tasks that help 
instructors and students to stay productive on-the-go.
Wearable technology is poised to see significant growth 
in the coming years, spurring experimentation in higher 
education because the demand for wearables is seen to 
be coming in large part from college-aged students; a 
recent poll showed that 21% of US adult students use 
wearables. Further, another report by GlobalWebIndex 
revealed that 71% of students ages 16 to 24 want to use 
wearable technology such as smart watches, wristbands, 
or glasses.241 The global wearable technology market as 
a whole is expected to grow at a compound annual rate 
of 35% over the next five years primarily dominated 
by Apple and Google, who already comprise 90% of 
the mobile platform market. While North America and 
Europe are the largest players in the global market, Asia 
is expected to show increased growth rates over the 
next several years.242 
A notable recent advancement in wearable technology 
involves the release of the Oculus Rift and its capability 
of providing virtual reality through goggles. YouVisit has 
adapted over 1,000 virtual college tours so they can be 
viewed on Oculus Rift headsets. Stony Brook University 
in New York and University of New Haven in Connecticut, 
for example, plan to implement this wearable technology 
into their marketing efforts. Virtual tours will allow 
students to go into campus spaces not typically open 
to visitors.243 The Oculus Rift headset is also enabling 
students to explore potentially dangerous situations 
from the safety of the classroom. One virtual education 
expert has created a virtual construction worksite 
where engineering students can identify unsafe areas 
without exposure to harm. Health care research and 
training continues to advance the potential of wearable 
technology, as well. The Medical Virtual Reality group 
at the University of Southern California has developed 
simulations for wearable technology use for clinical 
purposes.244 One of their projects focuses on medical 
training under simulated battlefield conditions.245
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
Google Glass’ ability to display information in a hands-
free format, enable communication via voice command, 
and broadcast and record student training activities is 
giving medical school leaders the confidence to begin 
integrating it into their degree programs. Students are 
gaining an unprecedented first-person perspective, 
learning medical procedures from a faculty member or 
becoming more empathetic by taking a patient’s point 
of view. The University of California Irvine School of 
43Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
Medicine is incorporating Google Glass into its degree 
program, from first- and second-year anatomy courses 
to third- and fourth-year hospital rotations.246 Similarly, 
SUNY Cobleskill is piloting the use of Google Glass devices 
to show how instructors perform paramedic or animal 
hoof health procedures.247 Beyond medical training, 
Google Glass is seeing applications in other fields. At 
University of Wisconsin-Madison, a finance professor 
is using it to record himself grading assignments. By 
verbalizing the grading process, students are able to get 
personalized feedback that would otherwise be lost.248 
The number of new wearable devices in the consumer 
sector seems to be increasing daily, greatly outpacing 
the implementation of this technology in universities. 
The higher education sector is just beginning to 
experiment with wearable technologies, though 
potential applications for athletic and health-related 
uses are already being realized. Most fitness sensors that 
are currently available can only measure a person’s pace 
or their heart rate, but recent innovations are adding the 
dimension of chemical information analysis. Researchers 
at University of California San Diego, for example, are 
creating disposable and embeddable sensors to analyze 
a person’s perspiration and saliva to improve fitness, 
wellness, and performance.249 The University of Michigan 
is also developing a vapor sensor that can help monitor 
the health of patients with diabetes and lung disease 
as well as detect airborne chemicals. This monitoring 
system can be extended to the laboratory by registering 
the presence of hazardous chemical leaks and alerting 
students of danger.250 
While universities continue to experiment with 
wearable technologies and formally integrate them 
into educational settings, there is increased activity 
in university research departments where they are 
pushing the boundaries to provide a foundation for 
future wearables. In New Zealand, two University of 
Canterbury psychology and engineering researchers 
are joining forces to examine ways to make wearable 
technology systems easier to use. Their goal is to create 
an interface with sensors, data storage, and memory, 
to minimize distractions so a user is more in tune with 
their physical surroundings while composing and 
sending a text or email.251 The University of Surrey 
and University of Oldenburg are leveraging wearable 
technology so that researchers can gather data on 
brain behavior in real-time during real world activities. 
By using new electroencephalography (EEG) systems 
worn by participants doing everyday activities outside 
of traditional laboratory settings, researchers hope to 
understand brain structures, functions, and processes.252

Adaptive Learning Technologies
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Four to Five Years
A
daptive learning technologies refer to software 
and online platforms that adjust to individual 
students’ needs as they learn. According to 
a paper commissioned by the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation and authored by Education 
Growth Advisors, adaptive learning is a “sophisticated, 
data-driven, and in some cases, nonlinear approach to 
instruction and remediation, adjusting to a learner’s 
interactions and demonstrated performance level, 
and subsequently anticipating what types of content 
and resources learners need at a specific point in time 
to make progress.”253 In this sense, contemporary 
educational tools are now capable of learning the 
way people learn; enabled by machine learning 
technologies, they can adapt to each student’s 
progress and adjust content in real-time or provide 
customized exercises when they need it. In higher 
education, many faculty envision these adaptive 
platforms as new, patient tutors that can provide 
personalized instruction on a large scale. There are 
two levels to adaptive learning technologies — the 
first platform reacts to individual user data and adapts 
instructional material accordingly, while the second 
leverages aggregated data across a large sample of 
users for insights into the design and adaptation of 
curricula.
Overview
The emergence of adaptive learning technologies reflects 
a movement in academia towards customizing learning 
experiences for each individual. Governments and 
campuses across the globe are increasingly recognizing 
that the one-size-fits-all approach to teaching alienates 
students who are struggling with specific concepts — 
along with students who are grasping the material more 
quickly than their peers.254 In higher education settings, 
especially in large, introductory courses, instructors 
rarely have the capacity to design curricula and lectures 
that uniquely cater to every student enrolled. Integrating 
personalized learning was cited as a difficult challenge in 
this report, and adaptive learning technologies provide 
one pathway for tailoring educational opportunities. 
While adaptive learning technologies are still at 
least four years away from widespread use in higher 
education, a number of studies highlight their potential 
for transforming traditional learning paradigms, and an 
important next step is developing standards and best 
practices.255
Adaptive learning is best suited to take place in 
hybrid and online learning environments, where 
student activities are conducted virtually and can 
be monitored by software and tracking applications. 
Historically categorized as intelligent tutoring, adaptive 
learning takes advantage of the latest developments 
in artificial intelligence to adjust to students’ personal 
preferences.256 At the most basic level, the adaptive 
component of the platforms involve algorithms that 
employ an “if this, then that” approach. More robust 
models entail algorithms that link specific concepts and 
skills from the course to how students are interacting 
with the material; a student, for example, may spend 
a disproportionate amount of time reading a single 
passage that summarizes String Theory, signaling the 
algorithm to serve up more resources for them to better 
comprehend the concept.
Upon collecting students’ behavioral data, adaptive 
learning technologies often display data visualizations 
in the form of comprehensive dashboards that can be 
regularly monitored by instructors.257 These dashboards 
are often viewable by students so they can gain a better 
understanding of their progress through the course as 
well as what habits and activities are helping them learn 
more effectively. Instructor dashboards present data on 
a granular level, identifying which students may be at 
risk of failing their courses with the goal of increasing 
student retention. On a broader level, adaptive 
learning dashboards can help faculty better evaluate 
the effectiveness of their course design by examining 
student data collectively and making comparisons 
across all courses.
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
While adaptive learning technologies have the potential 
to be a game-changer and foster more personalized 
learning for students while providing institutions with 
key insights about the effectiveness of their instruction, 
current applications in higher education have been 
mostly limited to research, development, and pilot 
programs,258 justifying the topic’s position on the far-term 
horizon. There is a growing host of companies entirely 
45Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Four to Five Years
dedicated to developing adaptive learning platforms, 
including Knewton,259 Smart Sparrow,260 and Cerego.261 
Some education leaders, however, have expressed a 
need for adaptive learning platforms that integrate 
smoothly into campus’ existing learning management 
systems and courseware;262 standalone products may 
be a bigger investment for higher education institutions 
because they often require state-of-the-art technology 
infrastructures.
Some universities are staying ahead of the curve and 
have developed their own adaptive learning platforms. 
This is especially the case in the for-profit education 
sector; in 2013, a patent was issued to the University of 
Phoenix for its adaptive learning platform “Academic 
Activity Stream” — a billion dollar investment.263 
“Academic Activity Stream” is similar in appearance and 
functionality to social networks, ranking information for 
students based on their unique interests, performance 
history, and learning objectives. Similarly, the University 
of Michigan created “Gradecraft,” an online platform that 
encourages risk-taking and multiple pathways towards 
mastery as students progress through course material.264 
The “Gradecraft” environment is gamified, enabling 
students to see how their choices directly impact how 
well they absorb and demonstrate their understanding 
of new material as they move from level to level.265  
In one of the most large scale applications of adaptive 
learning technologies, major educational publisher 
Pearson teamed up with adaptive learning provider 
Knewton to provide thousands of science and business 
students at Arizona State University (ASU) with access 
to MyLab, adaptive services that detect patterns of 
students’ successes and failures with the course material 
and provide them with guidance accordingly.266 The data 
collected depicts the amount of time students spend on 
specific elements of an online resource, such as video 
and text, in correlation with their exam performances 
and assignments. After discerning patterns in student 
behavior, MyLab recommends to each student tailored 
content that will further their knowledge of the 
subject.267 Though initial results from the pilot were 
mixed, ASU reported that in many cases, instructors 
who were using MyLab more prominently experienced 
better outcomes. Preliminary findings indicated an 
18% increase in pass rates, and a 47% decrease in ASU’s 
student dropout rate.268

The Internet of Things
Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Four to Five Years
T
he Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of 
connected objects that link the physical world 
with the world of information through the 
web. When TCP/IPv6 launched in 2006, the 
new network expanded the capabilities of the 
Internet and enabled objects, sensors, and devices to be 
addressable and communicate across the Internet.269 
This augmented address space became particularly 
useful for automating industrial and manufacturing 
processes, enabling tracking technologies that 
monitor sensitive equipment or materials, point-
of-sale purchases, passport tracking, inventory 
management, and identification.270 Embedded chips, 
sensors, or tiny processors attached to an object 
can transmit information about the object such as 
cost, age, temperature, color, pressure, or humidity 
to another smart device or piece of machinery. This 
networked connection allows remote management, 
status monitoring, tracking, and alerts if the objects 
they are attached to are in danger of being damaged 
or spoiled. On another level, IoT is being applied by 
municipal governments and education institutions 
that are using automation to streamline processes, 
leverage data, and promote sustainability.271
Overview
It is no longer far-fetched to envision a world where 
all people, objects, and devices are connected to act 
in concert, regardless of brand or vendor. This idea is 
also known as The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is 
comprised of machine-to-machine (M2M), machine-to-
person, and person-to-person networked technologies. 
In this environment, sensors embedded on machines, 
people, and objects can capture events, which are 
sent through the IPv6 network to applications that 
create actionable information. Many consumers are 
already familiar with IoT through their experience with 
Nest, a next-generation thermostat that programs 
itself based on its surroundings and can be controlled 
via a smartphone.272 On the industry side, M2M IoT 
technologies are being used to modernize railways, 
agricultural equipment, and construction machinery 
with real-time monitoring capabilities.273 In the world 
where the Internet of Everything is realized, many 
choices and decisions will be automated, making life, and 
potentially learning, an efficient, streamlined experience. 
Enabling technologies such as smart sensors and chips 
are all well understood, easily mass-produced, and 
inexpensive, and a number of universities are already 
incorporating IoT technologies on their campuses. At 
the College of the Holy Cross, sensors within the biology 
lab freezers send warning emails when temperatures 
need to be adjusted, and students doing laundry in 
their dormitories can check availability of washing 
machines via their smartphones.274 Seeing potential for 
massive growth in this area and beyond, technology 
companies are setting their sights on realizing the 
potential for connected device technologies. After only 
a year of operation, Intel’s Internet of Things business 
unit is expected to reach $2 billion a year in revenue 
with nearly 20 percent annual growth.275 Currently, Intel 
provides energy management systems for clients in 
the commercial and industrial sector and equips cars 
with connected technology, although investments into 
wearables are on the horizon.276 
On a more comprehensive scale, urban planners 
are designing cityscapes with connectivity in mind, 
embedding networks into major infrastructures 
including roads, intersections, and parking lots. In 
2013, the mayor of Barcelona announced a 10-year 
plan that leverages IoE and a citywide wireless network 
to communicate with citizens, streamline operations, 
and conserve resources.277 Investments in devices that 
remotely monitor water pressure and pipe leakage 
are saving an estimated $58 million, and networked 
streetlights are reducing annual maintenance costs by 
one-third.278 The World Economic Forum (WEF) is keeping 
tabs on where the next smart city will pop up with the 
Networked Readiness Index (NRI), an assessment of 148 
countries; in their 2014 Global Information Technology 
Report, Singapore, Finland, and Sweden were ranked 
as the top three countries with a level of information 
and communication technologies that are developed 
enough to support IoE design.279
Relevance for Teaching, Learning, or 
Creative Inquiry
Use of IoT in educational environments is finally 
coming into focus as terms such as “hypersituation” are 
being coined to explain the potential of IoT in learning 
situations. Hypersituating is the ability to amplify 
knowledge based on the user’s location. In other words, 
47Time-to-Adoption Horizon: Four to Five Years
learners that carry connected devices with them can 
benefit from a host of interdisciplinary information 
that is pushed to them from their surroundings. For 
instance, a learner exploring a city with a rich historical 
past can explore their environment through an 
architectural, political, or biological lens, depending 
on how the surroundings are equipped. IoT can also 
create an environment where learners are informed by 
crowdsourced contributions and observations from the 
community via networked objects.280 
At the institutional level, Cisco Systems has laid out a four 
pillar vision for networked technologies that interweave 
people, processes, and data. For instruction, IoT in higher 
education takes the form of blended learning models 
that integrate personalized materials and formative 
assessment technologies that deliver instant feedback. 
In this landscape, students will have the ability to monitor 
their own environment and collect real-time data for 
further study. Similar to hypersituating, Cisco Systems 
also envisions a context-aware environment, where 
objects can communicate with students and vice versa 
to create relevant, interactive learning experiences.281 
Data gleaned from networked environments has been 
positioned as the great enabler of this scenario.282 While 
IoT for higher education is a relatively new area for Cisco 
Systems, the company’s CEO recently announced that 
their long-term strategy will focus efforts almost entirely 
on developing and creating networked environments 
for every sector.283 
As understanding around this emerging technology 
develops, universities are taking advantage of 
opportunities to give learners greater insight into the 
power of IoT. In summer 2014, Internet2 and micro-car 
maker Innova UEV partnered to give Innova Dash electric 
smart cars to Colorado State University, University of 
Pittsburg, University of Washington, and the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison. Each of these institutions will 
be embarking on a sustainable research project, using 
vehicle sensor data to investigate a host of questions 
related to the effectiveness of public transportation, 
physiological effects on drivers, and gamification, 
among others. Ultimately, the institutions that were 
selected intend to use their research to promote 
sustainable practice and support initiatives to reduce 
energy consumption.284
