ABSTRACT 
For the past 50 years, a wide variety of building 
energy simulation programs have been developed, 
enhanced and are in use throughout the building 
energy community. This paper is an overview of a 
report which provides up-to-date comparison of the 
features and capabilities of twenty major building 
energy simulation programs. The comparison is 
based on information provided by the program 
developers in the following categories: general 
modeling features; zone loads; building envelope and 
daylighting and solar; infiltration, ventilation and 
multizone airflow; renewable energy systems; 
electrical systems and equipment; HVAC systems; 
HVAC equipment; environmental emissions; 
economic evaluation; climate data availability, 
results reporting; validation; and user interface, links 
to other programs, and availability. 
INTRODUCTION  
Over the past 50 years, literally hundreds of building 
energy programs have been developed, enhanced and 
are in use. The core tools in the building energy field 
are the whole-building energy simulation programs 
which provide users with key building performance 
indicators such as energy use and demand, 
temperature, humidity, and costs. 
During that time, a number of comparative surveys 
of energy programs have been published, ranging 
from comprehensive surveys of building energy 
simulation programs to reviews of single topics such 
as daylighting tools or energy auditing.  Yet in our 
study we found that no comprehensive comparative 
survey of tools had been conducted in the past ten 
years.  
This paper provides a small excerpt from a much 
longer report which compares the features of twenty 
major building energy simulation programs: BLAST, 
BSim, DeST, DOE-2.1E, ECOTECT, Ener-Win, 
Energy Express, Energy-10, EnergyPlus, eQUEST, 
ESP-r, IDA ICE, IES <VE>, HAP, HEED, 
PowerDomus, SUNREL, Tas, TRACE and 
TRNSYS. The developers of these programs 
provided initial detailed information about their 
tools. This report by Crawley, Hand, Kummert, and 
Griffith (2005) includes more than five pages of 
detailed references for the surveys mentioned above 
as well as for the 20 tools.  The report contains 
detailed tables comparing the features and 
capabilities of the programs in the following 14 
categories:  General Modeling Features, Zone Loads, 
Building Envelope and Daylighting, Infiltration, 
Ventilation and Multizone Airflow, Renewable 
Energy Systems, Electrical Systems and Equipment, 
HVAC Systems, HVAC Equipment, Environmental 
Emissions, Economic Evaluation, Climate Data 
Availability, Results Reporting, Validation, and User 
Interface, Links to Other Programs, and Availability.

OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY 
PROGRAMS 
BLAST Version 3.0 Level 334, August 1998 
www.bso.uiuc.edu/BLAST   
The Building Loads Analysis and System 
Thermodynamics (BLAST) system predicts energy 
consumption and energy system performance and 
cost in buildings. BLAST contains three major 
subprograms: Space Loads Prediction, Air System 
Simulation, and Central Plant. Space Loads 
Prediction computes hourly space loads given hourly 
weather data and building construction and operation 
details using a radiant, convective, and conductive 
heat balance for all surfaces and a heat balance of the 
room air. This includes transmission loads, solar 
loads, internal heat gains, infiltration loads, and the 
temperature control strategy used to maintain the 
space temperature. BLAST can be used to investigate 
the energy performance of new or retrofit building 
design options of almost any type and size.  
BSim Version 4.4.12.11 
www.bsim.dk  
BSim provides user-friendly simulation of detailed, 
combined hygrothermal simulations of buildings and 
constructions. The package comprise several 
modules: SimView (graphic editor), tsbi5 (building 
- 231 -
simulation), SimLight (daylight), XSun (direct 
sunlight and shadowing), SimPV (photovoltaic 
power), NatVent (natural ventilation) and SimDxf 
(import from CAD). BSim has been used extensively 
over the past 20 years, previously under the name 
tsbi3. Today BSim is the most commonly used tool 
in Denmark, and with increasing interest abroad, for 
energy design of buildings and for moisture analysis. 
DeST Version 2.0, 2005 
www.dest.com.cn  (Chinese version only)  
DeST (Designer’s Simulation Toolkits) allows 
detailed analysis of building thermal processes and 
HVAC system performance. DeST comprises a 
number of different modules for handling different 
functions: Medpha (weather data), VentPlus (natural 
ventilation), Bshadow (external shading), Lighting 
(lighting), and CABD (CAD interface). BAS 
(Building Analysis & Simulation) performs hourly 
calculations for indoor air temperatures and 
cooling/heating loads for buildings, including 
complicated buildings of up to 1000 rooms. 
There are five versions in the DeST family: DeST-h 
(residences), DeST-c (commercial), DeST-e 
(building evaluation), DeST-r (building ratings) and 
DeST-s (solar buildings). DeST has been widely 
used in China for various prestige large structures 
such as the State Grand Theatre and the State 
Swimming Centre. 
DOE-2.1E Version 121, September 2003 
simulationresearch.lbl.gov  
DOE-2.1E predicts the hourly energy use and energy 
cost of a building given hourly weather information, 
a building geometric and HVAC description, and 
utility rate structure. DOE-2.1E has one subprogram 
for translation of input (BDL Processor), and four 
simulation subprograms (LOADS, SYSTEMS, 
PLANT and ECON). LOADS, SYSTEMS and 
PLANT are executed in sequence, with the output of 
LOADS becoming the input of SYSTEMS, etc. The 
output then becomes the input to ECONOMICS. 
Each of the simulation subprograms also produces 
printed reports of the results of its calculations.  
DOE-2.1E has been used extensively for more than 
25 years for both building design studies, analysis of 
retrofit opportunities, and for developing and testing 
building energy standards in the U.S. and around the 
world. The private sector has adapted DOE-2.1E by 
creating more than 20 interfaces that make the 
program easier to use.  
ECOTECT Version 5.50, April 2005 
www.ecotect.com  
Ecotect is a highly visual architectural design and 
analysis tool that links a comprehensive 3D modeller 
with a wide range of performance analysis functions 
covering thermal, energy, lighting, shading, acoustics 
and cost aspects. Whilst its modelling and analysis 
capabilities can handle geometry of any size and 
complexity, its main advantage is a focus on 
feedback at the earliest stages of the building design 
process. 
In addition to standard graph and table-based reports, 
analysis results can be mapped over building surfaces 
or displayed directly within the spaces. This includes 
visualisation of volumetric and spatial analysis 
results, including imported 3D CFD data. Real-time 
animation features are provided along with 
interactive acoustic and solar raytracing that updates 
in real time with changes to building geometry and 
material properties. 
Ener-Win Version EC, June 2005 
members.cox.net/enerwin 
Ener-Win, originally developed at Texas A&M 
University, simulates hourly energy consumption in 
buildings, including annual and monthly energy 
consumption, peak demand charges, peak heating 
and cooling loads, solar heating fraction through 
glazing, daylighting contribution, and a life-cycle 
cost analysis. Design data, tabulated by zones, also 
show duct sizes and electric power requirements. 
The Ener-Win software is composed of several 
modules — an interface module, a weather data 
retrieval module, a sketching module, and an energy 
simulation module. The interface module includes a 
rudimentary building sketching interface.  Ener-Win 
requires only three basic inputs: (1) the building 
type, (2) the building’s location, and (3) the 
building’s geometrical data.  
Energy Express, Version 1.0, February 2005  
www.ee.hearne.com.au 
Energy Express is a design tool, created by CSIRO, 
for estimating energy consumption and cost at the 
design stage.  The user interface allows fast and 
accurate model creation and manipulation. Energy 
Express includes a dynamic multi-zone heat transfer 
model coupled to an integrated HVAC model so that 
zone temperatures are impacted by any HVAC 
shortcomings. 
Energy Express for Architects provides graphic 
geometry input and editing, multiple report viewing, 
comparison of alternative designs and results, 
simplified HVAC model, and detailed online help. 
Energy Express for Engineers provides those 
capabilities along with peak load estimating, and 
detailed HVAC model, graphic editing of air 
handling system and thermal plant layouts. 
- 232 -
Energy-10 Version 1.8, June 2005 
www.nrel.gov/buildings/energy10  
Energy-10 was designed to facilitate the analysis of 
buildings early in the design process with a focus on 
providing a comprehensive tool suited to the design-
team environment for smaller buildings. Rapid 
presentation of reference and low-energy cases is the 
hallmarks of Energy-10. Since Energy-10 evaluates 
one or two thermal zones, it is most suitable for 
smaller, 10,000 ft2 (1000 m2) or less, simpler, 
commercial and residential buildings. 
Energy-10 takes a baseline simulation and 
automatically applies a number of predefined 
strategies ranging from building envelope 
(insulation, glazing, shading, thermal mass, etc.) and 
system efficiency options (HVAC, lighting, 
daylighting, solar service hot water and integrated 
photovoltaic electricity generation). Full life-cycle 
costing is an integral part of the software. 
EnergyPlus Version 1.2.2, April 2005 
www.energyplus.gov  
EnergyPlus is a modular, structured code based on 
the most popular features and capabilities of BLAST 
and DOE-2.1E. It is a simulation engine with input 
and output of text files. Loads calculated (by a heat 
balance engine) at a user-specified time step (15-
minute default) are passed to the building systems 
simulation module at the same time step. The 
EnergyPlus building systems simulation module, 
with a variable time step, calculates heating and 
cooling system and plant and electrical system 
response. This integrated solution provides more 
accurate space temperature prediction—crucial for 
system and plant sizing, occupant comfort and 
occupant health calculations. Integrated simulation 
also allows users to evaluate realistic system 
controls, moisture adsorption and desorption in 
building elements, radiant heating and cooling 
systems, and interzone air flow. 
eQUEST Version 3.55, February 2005 
www.doe2.com/equest 
eQUEST is a easy to use building energy use 
analysis tool which provides high quality results by 
combining a building creation wizard, an energy 
efficiency measure (EEM) wizard and a graphical 
results display module with an enhanced DOE-2.2-
derived building energy use simulation program.  
The building creation wizard walks a user through 
the process of creating a building model.  Within 
eQUEST, DOE-2.2 performs an hourly simulation of 
the building based on walls, windows, glass, people, 
plug loads, and ventilation. DOE-2.2 also simulates 
the performance of fans, pumps, chillers, boilers, and 
other energy-consuming devices.  eQUEST allows 
users to create multiple simulations and view the 
alternative results in side-by-side graphics. It offers 
energy cost estimating, daylighting and lighting 
system control, and automatic implementation of 
energy efficiency measures (by selecting preferred 
measures from a list).  
ESP-r Version 10.1, February 2005 
www.esru.strath.ac.uk/Programs/ESP-r.htm  
ESP is a general purpose, multi-domain—building 
thermal, inter-zone air flow, intra-zone air 
movement, HVAC systems and electrical power 
flow—simulation environment which has been under 
development for more than 25 years. It follows the 
pattern of `simulation follows description` where 
additional technical domain solvers are invoked as 
the building and system description evolves. Users 
control the complexity of the geometric, 
environmental control and operations to match the 
requirements of particular projects. It supports an 
explicit energy balance in each zone and at each 
surface..  ESP-r is distributed under a GPL license. 
The web site also includes an extensive publications 
list, example models, source code, tutorials and 
resources for developers.  
HAP Version 4.20a, February 2004 
www.commercial.carrier.com  
Hourly Analysis Program (HAP) provides two tools 
in one package: sizing commercial HVAC systems  
and simulating hourly building energy performance 
to derive annual energy use and energy costs. Input 
data and results from system design calculations can 
be used directly in energy studies. 
HAP is designed for the practicing engineer, to 
facilitate the efficient day-to-day work of estimating 
loads, designing systems and evaluating energy 
performance. Tabular and graphical output reports 
provide both summaries of and detailed information 
about building, system and equipment performance. 
HAP is suitable for a wide range of new design and 
retrofit applications. It provides extensive features 
for configuring and controlling air-side HVAC 
systems and terminal equipment. Part-load 
performance models are provided for split DX units, 
packaged DX units, heat pumps, chillers and cooling 
towers. Hydronic loops can be simulated with 
primary-only and primary/secondary configurations, 
using constant speed or variable speed pumps.  
HEED Version 1.2, January 2005 
www.aud.ucla.edu/heed  
The objective of HEED is to combine a single-zone 
simulation engine with an user-friendly interface. It 
is intended for use at the very beginning of the 
design process, when most of the decisions are made 
that ultimately impact the energy performance of 
envelope-dominated buildings. 
- 233 -
HEED requires just four project inputs: floor area, 
number of stories, location (zip code), and building 
type. An expert system uses this information to 
design two base case buildings: scheme 1 meets 
California’s Title 24 Energy Code, and a scheme 2 
which is 30% more energy efficient. HEED 
automatically manages up to 9 schemes for up to 25 
different projects. 
HEED’s strengths are ease of use, simplicity of input 
data, a wide array of graphic output displays, 
computational speed, and the ability to quickly 
compare multiple design alternatives. Context 
specific Help, Advice, and a FAQ file are included. 
A full Spanish language version is also included. 
HEED is free, and can be downloaded from 
www.aud.ucla.edu/heed.  
IDA ICE Version 3.0, build 15, April 2005 
www.equa.se/ice  
IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) is based 
on a general simulation platform for modular 
systems, IDA Simulation Environment. Physical 
systems from several domains are in IDA described 
using symbolic equations, stated in either or both of 
the simulation languages Neutral Model Format 
(NMF) or Modelica. IDA ICE offers separated but 
integrated user interfaces to different user categories: 
• Wizard interfaces lead the user through the steps 
of building a model for a specific type of study. 
The Internet browser based IDA Room wizard 
calculates cooling and heating load. 
• Standard interface for users to formulate a 
simulation model using domain specific 
concepts and objects, such as zones, radiators 
and windows.  
• Advanced level interface – where the user is able 
to browse and edit the mathematical model of 
the system. 
• NMF and/or Modelica programming – for 
developers. 
IES <VE> Version 5.2, December 2004 
www.iesve.com  
The IES <Virtual Environment> (IES <VE>) is an 
integrated suite of applications linked by a common 
user interface and a single integrated data model. 
<Virtual Environment> modules include: 
• ModelIT – geometry creation and editing 
• ApacheCalc – loads analysis 
• ApacheSim – thermal 
• MacroFlo – natural ventilation  
• Apache HVAC – component based HVAC 
• SunCast – shading visualisation and analysis 
• MicroFlo – 3D computational fluid dynamics 
• FlucsPro/Radiance – lighting design 
• DEFT – model optimisation 
• LifeCycle – life-cycle energy and cost analysis 
• Simulex – building evacuation 
 
The program provides an environment for the 
detailed evaluation of building and system 
designs, allowing them to be optimized with 
regard to comfort criteria and energy use.  
PowerDomus Version 1.5, September 2005 
www.pucpr.br/lst  
PowerDomus is a whole-building simulation tool for 
analysis of both thermal comfort and energy use. It 
has been developed to model coupled heat and 
moisture transfer in buildings when subjected to any 
kind of climate conditions, i.e., considering both 
vapor diffusion and capillary migration. Its models 
predict temperature and moisture content profiles 
within multi-layer walls for any time step and 
temperature and relative humidity for each zone. 
PowerDomus allows users to visualize the sun path 
and inter-buildings shading effects and provides 
reports with graphical results of zone temperature 
and relative humidity, PMV and PPD, thermal loads 
statistics, temperature and moisture content within 
user-selectable walls/roofs, surface vapor fluxes and 
daily-integrated moisture sorption/ desorption 
capacity.  
SUNREL Version 1.14, November 2004 
www.nrel.gov/buildings/sunrel  
SUNREL is an hourly building energy simulation 
program that aids in the design of small energy-
efficient buildings where the loads are dominated by 
the dynamic interactions between the building's 
envelope, its environment, and its occupants.  
SUNREL has a simplified multizone nodal airflow 
algorithm that can be used to calculate infiltration 
and natural ventilation. Windows can be modeled by 
one of two methods.  Users can enter exact optical 
interactions of windows with identical layers of clear 
or tinted glass and no coatings on the layers. Thermal 
properties are modeled with a fixed U-value and 
fixed surface coefficients. For the second method, a 
user imports data from Window 4 or 5.  SUNREL 
only models idealized HVAC equipment. The 
equipment and loads calculations are solved 
simultaneously, and the equipment capacities can be 
set to unlimited. Fans move a schedulable fixed 
amount of air between zones or from outside.  
Tas Version 9.0.7, May 2005 
 www.edsl.net  
Tas is a suite of software products, which simulate 
the dynamic thermal performance of buildings and 
their systems. The main module is Tas Building 
Designer, which performs dynamic building 
simulation with integrated natural and forced airflow. 
It has a 3D graphics based geometry input that 
includes a CAD link. Tas Systems is a HVAC 
- 234 -
systems/controls simulator, which may be directly 
coupled with the building simulator. It performs 
automatic airflow and plant sizing and total energy 
demand. The third module, Tas Ambiens, is a robust 
and simple to use 2D CFD package which produces a 
cross section of micro climate variation in a space. 
Tas combines dynamic thermal simulation of the 
building structure with natural ventilation 
calculations which include advanced control 
functions on aperture opening and the ability to 
simulate complex mixed mode systems. The software 
has heating and cooling plant sizing procedures, 
which include optimum start. Tas has 20 years of 
commercial use in the UK and around the world.  
TRACE 700 Version 4.1.10, November 2004 
www.tranecds.com  
TRACE is divided into four distinct calculation 
phases: Design, System, Equipment and Economics. 
During the Design Phase the program first calculates 
building heat gains for conduction through building 
surfaces as well as heat gains from people, lights, and 
appliances and impact of ventilation and infiltration. 
Finally, the program sizes all coils and air handlers 
based on these maximum loads.  
During the System Phase, the dynamic response of 
the building is simulated for an 8760-hour (or 
reduced) year by combining room load profiles with 
the characteristics of the selected airside system to 
predict the load imposed on the equipment. The 
Equipment Phase uses the hourly coil loads from the 
System Phase to determine how the cooling, heating, 
and air moving equipment will consume energy. The 
Economic Phase combines economic input supplied 
by the user with the energy usage from the 
Equipment Phase to calculate each alternative's 
utility cost, installed cost, maintenance cost and life 
cycle cost.  
TRNSYS Version 16.0.37, February 2005 
sel.me.wisc.edu/trnsys 
TRNSYS is a transient system simulation program 
with a modular structure that was designed to solve 
complex energy system problems by breaking the 
problem down into a series of smaller components. 
TRNSYS components (referred to as "Types") may 
be as simple as a pump or pipe, or as complicated as 
a multi-zone building model.  
The components are configured and assembled using 
a fully integrated visual interface known as the 
TRNSYS Simulation Studio, and building input data 
is entered through a dedicated visual interface 
(TRNBuild). The simulation engine then solves the 
system of algebraic and differential equations that 
represent the whole system. In building simulations, 
all HVAC-system components are solved 
simultaneously with the building envelope thermal 
balance and the air network at each time step. In 
addition to a detailed multizone building model, the 
TRNSYS library includes components for solar 
thermal and photovoltaic systems, low energy 
buildings and HVAC systems, renewable energy 
systems, cogeneration, fuel cells, etc. 
The modular nature of TRNSYS facilitates the 
addition of new mathematical models to the program. 
In addition to the ability to develop new components 
in any programming language, the program allows to 
directly embed components implemented using other 
software (e.g. Matlab/Simulink, Excel/VBA, and 
EES). TRNSYS can also generate executables that 
allow non-expert to run parametric studies. 
COMPARISON AMONG THE TOOLS 
Readers of the report who have specific simulation 
tasks or technologies in mind should be able to 
quickly identify likely candidate tools. The web sites 
and detailed references and footnotes included in the 
report would then allow a potential user to confirm 
that the programs indeed have the capabilities. 
From our experience, many users are relying on a 
single simulation tool when they might be more 
productive having a suite of tools from which to 
chose.  Early design decisions may not require a 
detailed simulation program to deal with massing or 
other early design problems.  We encourage users to 
consider adopting a suite of tools which would 
support the range of simulation needs they usually 
see in their practice.  
Because the 14 tables comprise 30 pages with more 
than 250 footnotes in the full comparison report, this 
paper provides only a glimpse of the wealth of 
information in the tables.  Here we present portions 
of Tables 2, 3, and 11, a summary of Tables 5, 7 and 
8, as well as the complete Table 4 to demonstrate the 
variety of approaches and solutions represented by 
these programs.  For example in Table 2, note that 
almost all the programs deal with internal thermal 
mass; yet most tools only perform design sizing 
calculations using dry bulb temperature. 
While the tables may indicate a tool has a capability, 
note that there are many nuances of ‘capability’ that 
the developers found difficult to communicate.  For 
example, there are several levels of resolution here—
one tool may do a simplified solution while another 
may have multiple approaches for that feature. 
The tables attempt to resolve this by providing more 
depth than a simple X (has capability) by including P 
(partially implemented), O (optional), R (research 
use), E (expert use), or I (difficult to obtain input 
data) or through extensive explanatory footnotes.  In 
many tables, many tools allow user-specified 
correlations, solution methods, or convergence 
criteria. 
- 235 -
CONCLUSIONS 
As we began working on this paper, we found that 
even among the ‘mature’ tools, there was not quite a 
common language to describe what the tools could 
do. There was much ambiguity which will continue 
to require additional work to resolve in the future. 
This report does not attempt to deal with whether the 
tools would support analysis over the lifetime of the 
project—from design through construction into 
operation and maintenance. 
We also found that there was a relatively new level 
of attention and interest in publishing validation 
results. Several program developers also indicated 
that they plan to make the simulation inputs available 
to users for download in the near future. 
There is also the issue of trust—do the tools really 
perform the capabilities indicated, and which level of 
effort by the user is involved?  How detailed is the 
model behind a tick in the table? For open source 
tools, everyone can check the model and adapt it. For 
the other tools, only very detailed BESTEST-like 
procedures can give the answer. We may need a way 
for users to provide feedback and ratings for these in 
the future. 
Next generation of the report?   Dynamic web-based   
community resource with direct links for each tool to 
example input files for each capability as well as the 
suite of validation inputs … and in some sense this is 
already beginning.  The authors’ organizations have 
begun making their input files for IEA BESTEST 
easily available. 
We envision this report as a community resource 
which will be regularly updated and expanded as the 
tools (and the simulation field) mature and grow.
