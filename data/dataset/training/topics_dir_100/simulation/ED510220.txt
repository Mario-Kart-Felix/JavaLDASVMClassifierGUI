The annual Horizon Report describes the continuing 
work of the New Media Consortium’s Horizon Project, 
a qualitative research project established in 2002 
that identifies and describes emerging technologies 
likely to have a large impact on teaching, learning, or 
creative inquiry on college and university campuses 
within the next five years. The 2010 Horizon Report 
is the seventh in the series and is produced as part 
of an ongoing collaboration between the New Media 
Consortium (NMC) and the EDUCAUSE Learning 
Initiative (ELI), an EDUCAUSE program. 
In each edition of the Horizon Report, six emerging 
technologies or practices are described that are 
likely to enter mainstream use on campuses within 
three adoption horizons spread over the next one 
to five years. Each report also presents critical 
trends and challenges that will affect teaching and 
learning over the same time frame. In the seven 
years that the Horizon Project has been underway, 
more than 400 leaders in the fields of business, 
industry, technology, and education have contributed 
to this long-running primary research effort. They 
have drawn on a comprehensive body of published 
resources, current research and practice, their own 
considerable expertise, and the expertise of the NMC 
and ELI communities to identify technologies and 
practices that are beginning to appear on campuses 
or are likely to be adopted in the next few years. The 
2010 Advisory Board, like those before it, considered 
a broad picture of emerging technology and its 
intersection with the academic world through a close 
examination of primary sources as well as through 
the lens of their own experiences and perspectives. 
The research methodology employed in producing 
the report is detailed in a special section that follows 
the body of the report.
The report’s format is consistent from year to 
year, opening with a discussion of the trends and 
challenges identified by the Advisory Board as 
most critical for the next five years. The format of 
the main section closely reflects the focus of the 
Horizon Project itself, centering on the applications 
eXeCuTiVe suMMarY
of emerging technologies to teaching, learning, 
and creative inquiry. Each topic is introduced with 
an overview that describes what it is, followed by a 
discussion of the particular relevance of the topic to 
education, creativity, or research. Examples of how 
the technology is being, or could be applied to those 
activities are given. Finally, each section closes 
with an annotated list of suggested readings and 
additional examples that expand on the discussion 
in the report and a link to the tagged resources 
collected during the research process by project 
staff, the Advisory Board, and others in the growing 
Horizon Project community.
Key Trends
The technologies featured in each edition of the 
Horizon Report are embedded within a contemporary 
context that reflects the realities of the time, both in 
the sphere of academia and in the world at large. 
To assure this perspective, each Advisory Board 
researches, identifies, and ranks key trends that are 
currently affecting the practice of teaching, learning, 
and creative inquiry, and uses these as a lens for 
its later work. These trends are surfaced through 
an extensive review of current articles, interviews, 
papers, and new research. Once identified, the list 
of trends is ranked according to how significant an 
impact they are likely to have on education in the 
next five years. The following four trends have been 
identified as key drivers of technology adoptions for 
the period 2010 through 2015; they are listed here in 
the order they were ranked by the Advisory Board.
 The abundance of resources and relationships 
made easily accessible via the Internet is 
increasingly challenging us to revisit our roles 
as educators in sense-making, coaching, and 
credentialing. Institutions must consider the 
unique value that each adds to a world in which 
information is everywhere. In such a world, sense-
making and the ability to assess the credibility 
of information are paramount. Mentoring and 
preparing students for the world in which they 
will live, the central role of the university when it 
achieved its modern form in the 14th century, is 
again at the forefront. Universities have always 
been seen as the gold standard for educational 
credentialing, but emerging certification 
programs from other sources are eroding the 
value of that mission daily. 
 People expect to be able to work, learn, and 
study whenever and wherever they want to. Life 
in an increasingly busy world where learners 
must balance demands from home, work, 
school, and family poses a host of logistical 
challenges with which today’s ever more mobile 
students must cope. A faster approach is often 
perceived as a better approach, and as such 
people want easy and timely access not only to 
the information on the network, but to their social 
networks that can help them to interpret it and 
maximize its value. The implications for informal 
learning are profound, as are the notions of 
“just-in-time” learning and “found” learning, both 
ways of maximizing the impact of learning by 
ensuring it is timely and efficient. 
 The technologies we use are increasingly 
cloud-based, and our notions of IT support 
are decentralized. The continuing acceptance 
and adoption of cloud-based applications and 
services is changing not only the ways we 
configure and use software and file storage, but 
even how we conceptualize those functions. It 
does not matter where our work is stored; what 
matters is that our information is accessible 
no matter where we are or what device we 
choose to use. Globally, in huge numbers, we 
are growing used to a model of browser-based 
software that is device-independent. While some 
challenges still remain, specifically with notions 
of privacy and control, the promise of significant 
cost savings is an important driver in the search 
for solutions.
 The work of students is increasingly seen as 
collaborative by nature, and there is more cross-
campus collaboration between departments. 
While this trend is not as widespread as the 
others listed here, where schools have created 
a climate in which students, their peers, and 
their teachers are all working towards the same 
goals, where research is something open even 
to first year students, the results have shown 
tantalizing promise. Increasingly, both students 
and their professors see the challenges facing 
the world as multidisciplinary, and the need for 
collaboration great. Over the past few years, the 
emergence of a raft of new (and often free) tools 
has made collaboration easier than at any other 
point in history.
Critical Challenges
Along with current trends, the Advisory Board notes 
critical challenges that face learning organizations, 
especially those that are likely to continue to affect 
education over the five-year time period covered by 
this report. Like the trends, these are drawn from a 
careful analysis of current events, papers, articles, 
and similar sources, as well as from the personal 
experience of the Advisory Board members in their 
roles as leaders in education and technology. Those 
challenges ranked as most significant in terms of 
their impact on teaching, learning, and creative 
inquiry in the coming years are listed here, in the 
order of importance assigned them by the Advisory 
Board.
 The role of the academy — and the way we 
prepare students for their future lives — is 
changing. In a 2007 report, the American As-
sociation of Colleges and Universities recom-
mended strongly that emerging technologies 
be employed by students in order for them to 
gain experience in “research, experimentation, 
problem-based learning, and other forms of 
creative work,” particularly in their chosen fields 
of study. It is incumbent upon the academy to 
adapt teaching and learning practices to meet 
the needs of today’s learners; to emphasize 
critical inquiry and mental flexibility, and provide 
students with necessary tools for those tasks; to 
connect learners to broad social issues through 
civic engagement; and to encourage them to ap-
ply their learning to solve large-scale complex 
problems.
e X e C u T i V e  s u M M a r Y
T H e  H o r i Z o N  r e P o r T  –  2 0 1 0 5
 New scholarly forms of authoring, publishing, 
and researching continue to emerge but appro-
priate metrics for evaluating them increasingly 
and far too often lag behind. Citation-based 
metrics, to pick one example, are hard to apply 
to research based in social media. New forms 
of peer review and approval, such as reader 
ratings, inclusion in and mention by influential 
blogs, tagging, incoming links, and retweeting, 
are arising from the natural actions of the global 
community of educators, with increasingly rel-
evant and interesting results. These forms of 
scholarly corroboration are not yet well under-
stood by mainstream faculty and academic de-
cision makers, creating a gap between what is 
possible and what is acceptable. 
 Digital media literacy continues its rise in im-
portance as a key skill in every discipline and 
profession. The challenge is due to the fact 
that despite the widespread agreement on its 
importance, training in digital literacy skills and 
techniques is rare in any discipline, and espe-
cially rare in teacher education programs. As 
faculty and instructors begin to realize that they 
are limiting their students by not helping them 
to develop and use digital media literacy skills 
across the curriculum, the lack of formal train-
ing is being offset through professional develop-
ment or informal learning, but we are far from 
seeing digital media literacy as a norm. This 
reality is exacerbated by the fact that as tech-
nology continues to evolve, digital literacy must 
necessarily be less about tools and more about 
ways of thinking and seeing, and of crafting nar-
rative. That is why skills and standards based 
on tools and platforms have proven to be some-
what ephemeral and difficult to sustain.
 Institutions increasingly focus more narrowly on 
key goals, as a result of shrinking budgets in the 
present economic climate. Across the board, 
institutions are looking for ways to control costs 
while still providing a high quality of service. 
Schools are challenged by the need to support 
a steady — or growing — number of students 
with fewer resources and staff than before. In 
this atmosphere, it is critical for information 
and media professionals to emphasize 
the importance of continuing research into 
emerging technologies as a means to achieve 
key institutional goals. As one example, knowing 
the facts about shifting server- and network-
intensive infrastructure, such as email or media 
streaming, off campus in the current climate 
might present the opportunity to generate 
considerable annual savings.
These trends and challenges are having a profound 
effect on the way we experiment with, adopt, and 
use emerging technologies. These aspects of the 
world that surround and permeate academia serve 
as a frame for considering the probable impacts of 
the emerging technologies listed in the sections that 
follow.
Technologies to watch
The six technologies featured in each Horizon 
Report are placed along three adoption horizons 
that indicate likely time frames for their entrance into 
mainstream use for teaching, learning, or creative 
inquiry. The near-term horizon assumes the likelihood 
of entry into the mainstream for institutions within the 
next twelve months; the mid-term horizon, within two 
to three years; and the far-term, within four to five 
years. It should be noted that the Horizon Report is 
not a predictive tool. It is meant, rather, to highlight 
emerging technologies with considerable potential for 
our focus areas of teaching, learning, and creative 
inquiry. Each of them is already the focus of work at 
a number of innovative institutions around the world, 
and the work we showcase here reveals the promise 
of a wider impact.
on the near-term horizon — that is, within the 
next 12 months — are mobile computing and open 
content. 
Mobile computing, by which we mean use 
of the network-capable devices students are 
already carrying, is already established on many 
campuses, although before we see widespread 
use, concerns about privacy, classroom 
management, and access will need to be 
addressed. At the same time, the opportunity 
is great; virtually all higher education students 
carry some form of mobile device, and the 
cellular network that supports their connectivity 
continues to grow. An increasing number 
of faculty and instructional technology staff 
are experimenting with the possibilities for 
collaboration and communication offered by 
mobile computing. Devices from smart phones 
to netbooks are portable tools for productivity, 
learning, and communication, offering an 
increasing range of activities fully supported by 
applications designed especially for mobiles.
Open content, also expected to reach 
mainstream use in the next twelve months, is the 
current form of a movement that began nearly 
a decade ago, when schools like MIT began to 
make their course content freely available. Today, 
there is a tremendous variety of open content, 
and in many parts of the world, open content 
represents a profound shift in the way students 
study and learn. Far more than a collection of 
free online course materials, the open content 
movement is a response to the rising costs of 
education, the desire for access to learning in 
areas where such access is difficult, and an 
expression of student choice about when and 
how to learn.
The second adoption horizon is set two to three 
years out, where we will begin to see widespread 
adoptions of two well-established technologies that 
have taken off by making use of the global cellular 
networks — electronic books and simple augmented 
reality. Both of these technologies are entering the 
mainstream of popular culture; both are already used 
in practice at a surprising number of campuses; and 
both are expected to see much broader use across 
academia over the next two to three years. 
Electronic books have been available in some 
form for nearly four decades, but the past twelve 
months have seen a dramatic upswing in their 
acceptance and use. Convenient and capable 
electronic reading devices combine the activities 
of acquiring, storing, reading, and annotating 
digital books, making it very easy to collect and 
carry hundreds of volumes in a space smaller 
than a single paperback book. Already in the 
mainstream of consumer use, electronic books 
are appearing on campuses with increasing 
frequency. Thanks to a number of pilot programs, 
much is already known about student preferences 
with regards to the various platforms available. 
Electronic books promise to reduce costs, save 
students from carrying pounds of textbooks, and 
contribute to the environmental efforts of paper-
conscious campuses.
Simple augmented reality refers to the shift 
that has made augmented reality accessible 
to almost anyone. Augmented reality used 
to require specialized equipment, none of 
which was very portable. Today, applications 
for laptops and smart phones overlay digital 
information onto the physical world quickly and 
easily. While still two to three years away from 
widespread use on campuses, augmented 
reality is establishing a foothold in the consumer 
sector, and in a form much easier to access than 
originally envisioned.
on the far-term horizon, set at four to five years 
away for widespread adoption, but clearly already 
in use in some quarters, are gesture-based 
computing and visual data analysis. Neither of 
these two technologies is yet commonly found in 
campus settings, but the high level of interest and 
the tremendous amounts of research in both areas 
indicates that they are worth following closely. 
Gesture-based computing is already strong in 
the consumer market and we are seeing a grow-
ing number of prototypical applications for train-
ing, research, and study, though this technology 
is still some time away from common educa-
tional use. Devices that are controlled by natural 
movements of the finger, hand, arm, and body 
are becoming more common. Game companies 
in particular are exploring the potential offered 
by consoles that require no handheld control-
ler, but instead recognize and interpret body 
motions. As we work with devices that react to 
e X e C u T i V e  s u M M a r Y
T H e  H o r i Z o N  r e P o r T  –  2 0 1 0 7
us instead of requiring us to learn to work with 
them, our understanding of what it means to in-
teract with computers is beginning to change.
Visual data analysis, a way of discovering and 
understanding patterns in large data sets via 
visual interpretation, is currently used in the 
scientific analysis of complex processes. As the 
tools to interpret and display data have become 
more sophisticated, models can be manipulated 
in real time and researchers are able to 
navigate and explore data in ways that were 
not possible previously. Visual data analysis 
is an emerging field, a blend of statistics, data 
mining, and visualization, that promises to make 
it possible for anyone to sift through, display, and 
understand complex concepts and relationships.
Each of these technologies is described in detail in 
the body of the report. These sections open with a 
discussion of what the technology is and why it is 
relevant to teaching, learning, and creative inquiry. 
Examples of the technology in practice, especially in 
academia, are listed there to illustrate how it is being 
adopted at the current time. Our research indicates 
that all six of these technologies, taken together, 
will have a significant impact on learning-focused 
organizations within the next five years.
Regular readers of the Horizon Report will note 
that some topics have strong ties to topics that 
were featured in past editions. Mobile computing, 
in particular, is the latest aspect of a trend toward 
smaller, more powerful computing devices that has 
grown over the past three years. We have watched 
mobile phones become increasingly capable and 
flexible. As described here, the topic of mobile 
computing encompasses handheld devices with the 
ability to access the Internet, a group of devices that 
includes the mobile phones most people carry as well 
as other often specialized devices that are increasingly 
powerful. The significance of mobile computing is 
not so much in the device used, but in the ability to 
easily access an expanding cellular network and fully-
featured tools from the palm of your hand.
Simple augmented reality and gesture-based 
computing also have roots in previous editions. 
Augmented reality first appeared in the 2005 
Horizon Report on the far-term horizon, returning in 
2006 with a focus on its applications for visualizing 
large data sets, a use that is now common in many 
research labs. Today, augmented reality has become 
simple and available on the computers and mobile 
devices we already own. Gesture-based computing 
is one offshoot of a group of technologies that was 
noted in the first Horizon Report, published in 2004; 
multimodal interfaces, as this group was called, 
included gestural as well as other types of input. 
Gesture-based computing also has ties to context-
aware computing, featured in 2005 and as context-
aware devices in 2006.
The Horizon Project 
Since March 2002, under the banner of the Horizon 
Project, the New Media Consortium has held an 
ongoing series of conversations and dialogs with 
hundreds of technology professionals, campus 
technologists, faculty leaders from colleges 
and universities, and representatives of leading 
corporations from more than two dozen countries. In 
each of the past six years, these conversations have 
resulted in the publication each January of a report 
focused on emerging technologies relevant to higher 
education. As the report is produced, an Advisory 
Board engages in lively dialogs using a wide range 
of articles, published and unpublished research, 
papers, scholarly blogs, and websites. The result of 
these dialogs is a list of the key technologies, trends, 
challenges, and issues that knowledgeable people 
in technology industries, higher education, and 
learning-focused organizations are thinking about. 
In 2008 and 2009, the NMC convened additional 
advisory boards to engage in a new series of regional 
and sector-based companion editions of the Horizon 
Report, with the dual goals of understanding how 
technology is being absorbed using a smaller lens, 
and also noting the contrasts between technology 
use in one area compared with another. To date, 
companion editions have been prepared that center 
on Australia and New Zealand, on the K-12 sector, 
and on small- to medium-sized businesses.
Each time a report is undertaken, the NMC 
uses qualitative research methods to identify the 
technologies selected for inclusion in that report, 
beginning with a survey of the work of other 
organizations and a review of the literature with an eye 
to spotting interesting emerging technologies. When 
the cycle starts, little is known, or even can be known, 
about the appropriateness or efficacy of many of the 
emerging technologies for these purposes, as the 
Horizon Project expressly focuses on technologies 
not currently in widespread use in academe. In a 
typical year, 75 or more of these technologies may 
be identified for further investigation; for the 2010 
report, more than 110 were considered. 
By engaging a wide community of interested parties, 
and diligently searching the Internet and other 
sources, enough information is gathered early in 
the process to allow the members of the Advisory 
Board to form an understanding of how each of 
the discovered technologies might be in use in 
settings outside of academe, to develop a sense 
of the potential the technology may have for higher 
education settings, and to envision applications of 
the technology for teaching, learning, and creative 
inquiry. The findings are discussed in a variety of 
settings — with faculty, industry experts, campus 
technologists, and of course, the Horizon Advisory 
Board. Of particular interest to the Advisory Board 
every year is finding educational applications for 
these technologies that may not be intuitive or 
obvious. 
Increasingly the Horizon Project is a global effort. 
Each year at least a third of the members of the 
advisory board represent countries outside of North 
America. Since 2007, with the aid of the Universitat 
Oberta de Catalunya, the Horizon Report has been 
translated into Spanish and Catalan. In 2008, the 
Horizon Project expanded with the publication of its 
first-ever regional report, the 2008 Horizon Report: 
Australia-New Zealand Edition. The 2009 Horizon 
Report was also translated into Japanese, German, 
and Chinese, as well as Spanish and Catalan, and 
plans are in place to add to those translations for 
the current report. In 2010, in partnership with the 
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, a new Spanish-
language report is planned especially for Ibero-
America that will look at the entire body of work from 
the project.
Each Horizon Report is produced over a period of 
just a few months so that the information is timely 
and relevant. This year, the effort to produce the 
report began in September 2009, and concluded 
when the report was released in January 2010, a 
period of just over four months. The six technologies 
and applications that emerged at the top of the final 
rankings — two per adoption horizon — are detailed 
in the chapters that follow. 
Each of those chapters includes detailed 
descriptions, links to active demonstration projects, 
and a wide array of additional resources related to 
the six profiled technologies. Those profiles are the 
heart of the 2010 Horizon Report, and will fuel the 
work of the Horizon Project throughout 2010-11. For 
those wanting to know more about the processes 
used to generate the Horizon Report, many of which 
are ongoing and extend the work in the report, we 
refer you to the report’s final section on the research 
methodology.

Time-to-adoption Horizon: one Year or Less
The available choices for staying connected while on the go are many — smart phones, netbooks, laptops, 
and a wide range of other devices access the Internet using cellular-based portable hotspots and mobile 
broadband cards, in addition to wi-fi that is increasingly available wherever people congregate. At the same 
time, the devices we carry are becoming ever more capable, and the boundaries between them more and 
more blurred. In the developed world, mobile computing has become an indispensable part of day-to-day life 
in the workforce, and a key driver is the increasing ease and speed with which it is possible to access the 
Internet from virtually anywhere in the world via the ever-expanding cellular network.
overview
Mobiles as a category have proven more interesting 
and more capable with each passing year, and 
continue to be a technology with new surprises. 
The mobile market today has nearly 4 billion 
subscribers, more than two-thirds of whom live in 
developing countries. Well over a billion new phones 
are produced each year, a flow of continuous 
enhancement and innovation that is unprecedented 
in modern times. The fastest-growing sales segment 
belongs to smart phones — which means that a 
massive and increasing number of people all over 
the world now own and use a computer that fits in 
their hand and is able to connect to the network 
wirelessly from virtually anywhere. Thousands of 
applications designed to support a wide range of 
tasks on virtually any smart-phone operating system 
are readily available, with more entering the market 
all the time. These mobile computing tools have 
become accepted aids in daily life, giving us on-the-
go access to tools for business, video/audio capture 
and basic editing, sensing and measurement, 
geolocation, social networking, personal productivity, 
references, just-in-time learning — indeed, virtually 
anything that can be done on a desktop. 
Users increasingly expect anytime, anywhere 
access to data and services that not very long ago 
were available only while sitting in front of a computer 
linked to the network via a cable. In addition to the 
typical software for email, communication, and 
calendaring, new tools allow users to manage 
personal information (such as Evernote, Nozbe, 
Wesabe, and TripIt), collaborate and easily access 
and share files (Dropbox and CalenGoo are two of 
many possible examples), or keep abreast of social 
networks (Limbo, Facebook, Foursquare, Whrrl), and 
generally make checking and updating work, school, 
or personal information flows something easily done 
on the fly. 
For many people all over the world, but especially 
in developing countries, mobiles are increasingly 
the access point not only for common tools and 
communications, but also for information of all kinds, 
training materials, and more. An ever more common 
pattern is for people to look to mobile computing 
platforms as their device of choice, as they are often 
far cheaper than desktop or laptop computers. For this 
group, mobile computing devices are more affordable, 
more accessible, and easier to use than desktop 
computers, and provide more than enough functionality 
to serve as their primary computing device. 
A middle ground for those who need a little more 
flexibility and power from a mobile platform includes 
netbooks, smartbooks, or other specialized devices. 
Smaller and lighter than a laptop, this category 
of devices can access the Internet via multiple 
networks. Netbooks run typical productivity and 
communications applications, using a standard 
keyboard and a compact laptop-like design. More 
specialized devices, like ebooks, email readers, 
and others are customized for a single purpose. The 
advantages they offer are storage and portability; the 
Kindle, for instance, makes it easy to carry a library 
full of reading material, while the Peek email reader 
delivers email access on a very compact device.
relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
The portability of mobile devices and their ability 
to connect to the Internet almost anywhere makes 
them ideal as a store of reference materials and 
learning experiences, as well as general-use tools 
for fieldwork, where they can be used to record 
observations via voice, text, or multimedia, and 
access reference sources in real time. At Ball State 
University, students gather meteorological data 
around campus, using Twitter on mobile devices 
to aggregate and disseminate their findings. At 
the University of Kansas, geology labs are being 
augmented by carefully designed field experiments 
that students can complete in blocks of three hours.
As faculty use of mobile computing has grown, studies 
have begun to emerge documenting the efficacy of 
both the tools and the techniques used to employ 
them. At Abilene Christian University, for example, all 
incoming freshmen were issued an iPhone or iPod 
Touch in 2009, providing a broad canvas upon which 
to explore the use of mobiles for instruction. One 
section of a chemistry course received laboratory 
preparation and safety lectures via podcast for mobile 
devices rather than in the classroom; performance 
scores for these students indicated that the mobile 
lectures were equally effective. At Franklin & Marshall 
College, sixteen faculty in the year-long mLearning 
Pilot Project are using iPod Touches to explore ways 
mobile computing can be used in teaching, learning, 
and research in disciplines like history, psychology, 
religious studies, world languages, government, 
classics, and more.
A Houston Community College pilot held in spring 
2009 compared study habits of two groups of 
students enrolled in the same anatomy course. One 
group, issued mobile devices, was found to work 
on the course during spare moments such as while 
waiting for appointments. The other group, using only 
desktop computers, appeared to spend less time 
overall working with the course content online. At the 
Open University of Catalunya (UOC), where many 
students commute or attend classes around full-time 
work schedules, course materials are made available 
not only in paper format, but also in audio, video, 
and text formats designed for mobile access. The 
University of Waterloo, another campus with a large 
commuter population, piloted delivery of materials 
for online courses to the BlackBerry platform. The 
response was very positive, and students noted 
increased time spent accessing course materials as 
well as higher levels of collaboration with classmates. 
The potential of mobile computing is being 
demonstrated in hundreds of projects at higher 
education institutions. Students in the University 
of Alabama’s Computer-Based Honors program, 
for example, are developing an application for the 
iPhone and iPod Touch that will deliver blood-sugar 
check reminders to patients with type 2 diabetes and 
provide resources about diabetes management, as 
well as collect information on how patients using 
the tool are succeeding in keeping their blood sugar 
under control. These data will be used in a research 
project comparing the effects of standard patient-
care practices with self-management practices as 
facilitated by the mobile application. A custom tool 
developed at Purdue University, Hotseat (http://
purdue.edu/hotseat), allows students to use their 
mobile devices to contribute to discussions, ask 
and answer questions, and respond to teacher 
prompts through any of several channels, including 
Facebook, Twitter, the Hotseat mobile application, 
or a web application. Students in a history course 
at the University of Texas-Dallas used Twitter to 
discuss course topics during class; the tweets were 
displayed on a large screen to encourage cross-
group communication.
A sampling of other applications of mobile computing 
across a variety of disciplines includes the following:
 Chemistry. At Bluegrass Community & Technical 
College, outdoor fieldwork has replaced many 
“cookbook” chemistry labs. Students use tablet 
o N e  Y e a r  o r  L e s s
T H e  H o r i Z o N  r e P o r T  –  2 0 1 0 11
PCs to record and analyze field research, 
present their findings, and compare results in 
real time.
 History. The Edinburgh College of Art, the 
University of Edinburgh, and the EDINA Data 
Centre collaboratively developed a mobile 
app called Walking Through Time. The app 
overlays historical maps onto current maps of 
the viewer’s location, showing street views and 
areas of interest from prior times.
 information Technology. Students at the Uni-
versity of Michigan developed an application for 
Google’s Android platform that measures power 
consumption on mobiles. The app, called Pow-
erTutor, is designed to help software developers 
create more efficient applications.
 Medicine. Harvard Medical School has released 
an iPhone app about the H1N1 virus, including 
maps of outbreaks, a symptom checker, and 
tips for avoiding infection or dealing with illness. 
The app is the first in a planned series of mobile 
applications developed at HMS in collaboration 
with medical school scientists and doctors.

overview
A new educational perspective, focused on collective 
knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning 
and scholarly content, has been gaining ground 
across the globe for nearly a decade. Open content 
has now come to the point that it is rapidly driving 
change in both the materials we use and the process 
of education. At its core, the notion of open content 
is to take advantage of the Internet as a global 
dissemination platform for collective knowledge and 
wisdom, and to design learning experiences that 
maximize the use of it. 
Open content, as described here, has its roots in 
a number of seminal efforts, including the Open 
Content Project, MIT’s Open Courseware Initiative 
(OCW), the Open Knowledge Foundation, and 
work by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation 
and others. Many of these projects focused on 
creating collections of sharable resources and on 
devising licenses and metadata schemata. The 
groundswell of interest in open content described 
here is differentiated from early work by its primary 
focus on the use of open content and its place in the 
curriculum. The role of open content producers has 
evolved as well, away from the idea of authoritative 
repositories of content and towards the broader 
notion of content being both free and ubiquitous. 
Building on the trailblazing models of institutions like 
MIT, schools like Tufts University (and many others) 
now consider making their course materials available 
to the public a social responsibility.
o P e N  C o N T e N T
Time-to-adoption Horizon: one Year or Less
The movement toward open content reflects a growing shift in the way academics in many parts of the world 
are conceptualizing education to a view that is more about the process of learning than the information 
conveyed in their courses. Information is everywhere; the challenge is to make effective use of it.  Part of 
the appeal of open content is that it is also a response to both the rising costs of traditionally published 
resources and the lack of educational resources in some regions, and a cost-effective alternative to textbooks 
and other materials. As customizable educational content is made increasingly available for free over the 
Internet, students are learning not only the material, but also skills related to finding, evaluating, interpreting, 
and repurposing the resources they are studying in partnership with their teachers.
An outgrowth of that perspective is the emergence 
of open-content textbooks that can be “remixed” — 
that is, customized, modified, or combined with other 
materials — and a number of publishers are finding 
ways to support authors of such materials. One such 
publisher, Flat World Knowledge, provides access 
to textbooks authored for open use, making it very 
easy for faculty to individually tailor a text for use in 
their own class. Flat World Knowledge operates as a 
publisher, reviewing book submissions and using a 
traditional editing process before release; however, 
electronic copies of the textbooks are free. Students 
only pay for print copies, and authors receive 
royalties for these purchases whether the book has 
been customized or not.
At the center of many discussions of open content are 
the challenges of sharing, repurposing, and reusing 
scholarly works; related to those discussions are 
concerns about intellectual property, copyright, and 
student-to-student collaboration, and solid work has 
been done by groups such as Creative Commons, 
the Academic Commons, Science Commons, and 
others to address many of the concerns commonly 
voiced. Many believe that reward structures that 
support the sharing of work in progress, ongoing 
research, highly collaborative projects, and a broad 
view of what constitutes scholarly publication are 
key challenges that institutions need to solve. Also 
to be addressed are reputation systems, peer review 
processes, and new models for citation of the new 
forms of content that are likely outgrowths of open 
content initiatives. 
While a number of highly structured projects exist 
to provide access to open content, in general, the 
open content community is diffuse and distributed; 
learning to find useful resources within a given 
discipline, assess the quality of content available, 
and repurpose them in support of a learning or 
research objective are in and of themselves valuable 
skills for any emerging scholar, and many adherents 
of open content list that aspect among the reasons 
they support the use of shareable materials. 
relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
Open content shifts the learning equation in a number 
of interesting ways; the most important is that its use 
promotes a set of skills that are critical in maintaining 
currency in any discipline — the ability to find, evaluate, 
and put new information to use. Almost as important 
is that the same set of materials, once placed online 
and made sharable via the appropriate licensing, can 
inform a wide variety of learning modalities, not the 
least of which is learning for the sheer joy of discovery.
Communities of practice and learning communities 
have formed around open content in a great many 
disciplines, and provide practitioners and independent 
learners alike an avenue for continuing education. 
OpenLearn (http://openlearn.open.ac.uk), a project 
of the Open University in the U.K., offers anyone the 
opportunity to join a study group while working through 
their open course content. OpenLearn practices a 
method known as “supported open learning,” in which 
students work through content at their own pace with 
help and guidance from a tutor. Faculty communities 
of practice are flourishing as well; at Trinity University, 
for example, faculty endorsed an Open Access policy 
that enables them to place copies of their scholarly 
works in an open-access repository shared by several 
liberal arts colleges.
Many sources of open content can easily be found 
in Creative Commons (http://creativecommons.
org), Teachers Without Borders (http://www.
teacherswithoutborders.org), and other online 
communities, while portals like Folksemantic (http://
www.folksemantic.com) offer a single point of entry to 
many open content offerings. Learning communities 
associated with services like Diigo or Twine can 
point educators in the right direction via the social 
networking equivalent of “word of mouth.”
A sampling of other open content projects across 
disciplines includes the following:
 art History. Smarthistory, an open educational 
resource dedicated to the study of art, seeks to 
replace traditional art history textbooks with an 
interactive, well-organized website. Search by 
time period, style, or artist (http://smarthistory.org).
 graduate studies. The Tokyo Institute of 
Technology offers 35 graduate level courses, 
open and free of charge, in the schools of science 
and engineering, bioscience and biotechnology, 
innovation management, and others.
 Health sciences. The Johns Hopkins Bloom-
berg School of Public Health provides open-
access classes to further the goal of improving 
global understanding of health-related issues. 
Courses include the school’s most popular sub-
jects, including adolescent health, infectious 
disease, genetics, and aging.
 Literature. Looking for Whitman (http://looking-
forwhitman.org) is an open-access, multi-institu-
tional experiment, dedicated to the study of the 
life and works of Walt Whitman.

Time-to-adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
As the technology underlying electronic readers has improved and as more titles have become available, 
electronic books are quickly reaching the point where their advantages over the printed book are compelling 
to almost any observer. The convenience of carrying an entire library in a purse, pocket, or book bag appeals 
to readers who find time for a few pages in between appointments or while commuting. Already firmly 
established in the public sector, electronic books are gaining a foothold on campuses as well, where they 
serve as a cost-effective and portable alternative to heavy textbooks and supplemental reading selections.
overview
Electronic books have reached mainstream adoption 
in the consumer sector; in 2009, the Kindle was 
Amazon.com’s best selling product, with more than 
390,000 titles available. The very first electronic 
versions of books were those digitized by Project 
Gutenberg in the 1970s. Electronic books were 
meant to be read using a computer until the late 
1990s; at that time, special devices for reading 
electronic books, known as e-readers or simply 
readers, began to appear on the market. The latest 
readers offer a high fidelity reading experience that 
offers most of the affordances of the printed book, 
with enhancements like wireless connectivity and 
ample storage that allow the typical device to hold 
more than 1,000 titles.
This ready availability of a selection of capable readers 
is one of the factors contributing to the success of 
electronic books. Not only are there many models 
available to please a variety of tastes — besides the 
Amazon Kindle, the Sony Reader, the new Barnes & 
Noble Nook, and a number of reader applications for 
iPhones, Android phones, and other smartphones have 
entered the market — but the capabilities of readers 
have advanced to the point where the experience truly 
rivals that of reading a paper book. Paper and ink color, 
font, type size, even the way pages are turned, are 
all customizable. Text is clear and crisp, with enough 
contrast to make it easy to read, and the devices are 
comfortable to hold for long periods of time.
Supported by such a wide variety of readers, 
electronic books have enjoyed a dramatic rise in 
popularity over the last year — Kindle editions, for 
example, now account for half of Amazon’s sales 
of books available both in print and for the Kindle. 
Readers of electronic books may be reading more, as 
well. Kindle owners, according to Amazon, buy three 
times as many books as they did before they had 
Kindles; Sony reports that Reader owners download 
about eight books per month — as compared to 
fewer than seven books per year purchased by the 
average American book buyer in 2008¹. 
The list of available titles, already broad and growing 
rapidly, is spurring that interest. Virtually all new books 
are available in electronic form, as well as classics, 
and popular books from the last 50 years. Collections 
of copyright-free texts, including great works of 
literature, are available at little or no cost. Publishers 
are releasing more titles in electronic formats as 
the popularity grows, leading to a wider selection of 
current books and new releases. Cost is generally a 
little lower than buying a paperback edition. 
Wirelessly connected readers make purchasing an 
electronic book a simple matter, often delivering a new 
volume in less than a minute. Purchases can be made 
at any time, from virtually any location, at no additional 
cost, and with no subscription or access fee. The 
convenience of having an entire library of books, 
magazines, and newspapers — each remembering 
exactly where you left off the last time you looked at 
them — and all in a single, small device is one of the 
most compelling aspects driving electronic reader sales.

relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
While the typical electronic reader could conceivably 
hold the entire sum of textbooks and readings for the 
entirety of one’s academic experience, campuses 
have been slower to adopt electronic books than the 
general public for three primary reasons, but all of 
them are becoming less of a constraint. 
The primary obstacle was simply availability. While 
a great variety of consumer titles are available 
electronically, textbooks or academic works have 
been published in electronic formats far less 
frequently. Secondly, as the reader technology 
developed, the ability to easily render high quality 
illustrations was initially limited. The last obstacle 
was related to the publishing model. Where electronic 
versions were available, they were most commonly 
viewed as ancillary to the printed version, which had 
to be purchased before the electronic version could 
be accessed — and the early versions were not in 
formats compatible with most readers. 
Over the past year or so, however, those obstacles 
have each started to fall away. Many academic 
titles are now available, and many more are in the 
pipeline. Amazon, for example, now lists some 
30,000 academic titles; all of the major textbook 
publishers have electronic versions in the Amazon 
education catalog. Advances in electronic reader 
technology have brought electronic versions of 
academic texts to a level with printed ones. The 
newest readers can display graphics of all kinds 
and make it easy to bookmark and annotate pages 
and passages. Annotations can be exported, viewed 
online, shared, and archived. In addition, electronic 
readers offer keyword searching, instant dictionary 
lookups and, in some cases, wireless Internet 
access. The experience of reading and note taking is 
becoming as easy in electronic form as it is in paper. 
Major publishers have largely uncoupled print and 
electronic sales of academic texts as well.
An encouraging number of colleges and universities 
are running pilot programs with electronic books. 
The Kindle DX, a larger format version of the device 
expressly built for academic texts, newspapers, and 
journals, is being piloted at Arizona State University, 
Ball State University, Case Western Reserve University, 
Pace University, Princeton, Reed College, Syracuse 
University, and the University of Virginia Darden School 
of Business. Northwest Missouri State University and 
Penn State have embarked on pilots using the Sony 
Reader. Johns Hopkins is piloting the enTourage 
eDGe, which combines the functions of an e-reader, 
a netbook, a notepad, and an audio/video recorder 
and player in one handheld device. Many other similar 
projects could be listed here, as the number of campus-
based evaluation pilots is large and growing rapidly. 
An obvious draw for students is the advantage of 
having a single handheld reading device that can 
easily accommodate the entirety of readings involved 
in one’s study, as well as all the essential reference 
texts. In a pilot program, Seton Hall University’s 
Teaching, Learning & Technology Center found that 
students appreciated the ability to store and review a 
semester’s worth of material in electronic form.
A survey of current projects shows that electronic 
books are being explored in virtually every discipline, 
although full-scale movement to electronic books is 
still two to three years away. A sampling of projects 
includes the following:
 extracurricular reading. The library at 
Fairleigh Dickinson University offers a selection 
of electronic readers that students may check 
out, including Amazon Kindles, Sony Readers, 
and iPod Touches. Each reader includes a 
selection of reference books, popular titles, 
literature, and more.
 foreign Language. First-year French students 
at the University of Texas at Austin use an online 
interactive textbook with a print-on-demand 
component, available in color or black-and-
white. The online portion includes audio clips of 
each part of the text and video clips to explore 
the culture of France (http://www.laits.utexas.

offered to institutions on a subscription basis 
by the American Council of Learned Societies, 
is a digital collection of 2,200 humanities texts. 
Students at subscribing institutions may browse 
and read the collection online or order printed 
copies on demand.
 Physics. MIT, in conjunction with Ball State 
University, produced an electronic book to 
visually demonstrate the principles of electricity 
and magnetism. (http://web.mit.edu/viz/EM/flash/

Time-to-adoption Horizon: Two to Three Years
While the capability to deliver augmented reality experiences has been around for decades, it is only very 
recently that those experiences have become easy and portable. Advances in mobile devices as well as in 
the different technologies that combine the real world with virtual information have led to augmented reality 
applications that are as near to hand as any other application on a laptop or a smart phone. New uses for 
augmented reality are being explored and new experiments undertaken now that it is easy to do so. Emerging 
augmented reality tools to date have been mainly designed for marketing, social purposes, amusement, or 
location-based information, but new ones continue to appear as the technology becomes more popular. 
Augmented reality has become simple, and is now poised to enter the mainstream in the consumer sector.
overview
The expression augmented reality (AR) is credited 
to former Boeing researcher Tom Caudell, who 
is believed to have coined the term in 1990. The 
concept of blending (augmenting) virtual data — 
information, rich media, and even live action — with 
what we see in the real world, for the purpose of 
enhancing the information we can perceive with 
our senses is a powerful one. Augmented reality 
itself is older than the term; the first applications of 
AR appeared in the late 1960s and 1970s. By the 
1990s, augmented reality was being put to use by 
a number of major companies for visualization, 
training, and other purposes. Now, the technologies 
that make augmented reality possible are powerful 
and compact enough to deliver AR experiences 
to personal computers and mobile devices. Early 
mobile applications began to appear in 2008, and 
several augmented reality mapping and social tools 
are now on the market.
Wireless mobile devices are increasingly driving 
this technology into the mobile space where the 
applications offer a great deal of promise.  Initially, AR 
required unwieldy headsets and kept users largely 
tethered to their desktop computers. The camera and 
screen embedded in smart phones and other mobile 
devices now serve as the means to combine real 
world data with virtual data; using GPS capability, 
image recognition, and a compass, AR applications 
can pinpoint where the mobile’s camera is pointing 
and overlay relevant information at appropriate 
points on the screen. 
Augmented reality applications can either be marker-
based, which means that the camera must perceive 
a specific visual cue in order for the software to call 
up the correct information, or markerless. Markerless 
applications use positional data, such as a mobile’s 
GPS and compass, or image recognition, where 
input to the camera is compared against a library 
of images to find a match. Markerless applications 
have wider applicability since they function anywhere 
without the need for special labeling or supplemental 
reference points.
Currently, many augmented reality efforts are 
focused on entertainment and marketing, but these 
will spill into other areas as the technology matures 
and becomes even more simplified. Layar (http://
layar.com) has been a leader in this space with 
AR applications for Android and iPhones. Layar’s 
mobile application features content layers that may 
include ratings, reviews, advertising, or other such 
information to assist consumers on location in 
shopping or dining areas. Other mobile applications 
that make use of AR for social or commercial 
purposes include Yelp, another review and rating 
service; Wikitude, which overlays information from 
Wikipedia and other sources onto a view of the real 
world; and a handful of Twitter clients. The mobile 
media company Ogmento develops AR games for 
mobiles. 
The improvement in technology allows more 
streamlined approaches and wider user adoption. 
Market projections for augmented reality on mobile 
devices predict revenues of $2 million in 2010, rising 
to several hundred million by 2014 ($350 million, 
according to ABI Research; Juniper Research’s 
projections are even higher). Augmented reality is 
poised to enter the mainstream in the consumer 
sector, and the social, gaming, and location-based 
applications that are emerging point to a strong 
potential for educational applications in the next few 
years.
relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
Augmented reality has strong potential to provide 
both powerful contextual, in situ learning experiences 
and serendipitous exploration and discovery of the 
connected nature of information in the real world. 
Mechanics in the military and at companies like 
Boeing already use AR goggles while they work 
on vehicles; the goggles demonstrate each step 
in a repair, identify the tools needed, and include 
textual instructions as well. This kind of augmented 
experience especially lends itself to training for 
specific tasks. 
Applications that convey information about a place 
open the door to discovery-based learning. Visitors to 
historic sites can access AR applications that overlay 
maps and information about how the location looked 
at different points of history. An application currently 
in development by the EU-funded iTacitus project 
(http://itacitus.org/) will allow visitors to pan across 
a location — the Coliseum, say — and see what it 
looked like during an historical event, complete with 
cheering spectators and competing athletes. People, 
too, will soon be explored through augmented 
reality. The TAT Augmented ID application, still in 
development, uses facial recognition technology to 
display certain, pre-approved information about a 
person when he or she is viewed through the camera 
of a mobile device. SREngine is another augmented 
reality application, also in development, that will 
use object recognition to display information about 
everyday things one encounters in the real world — 
comparing prices in a shopping center, for instance, 
or identifying trees. 
Of particular relevance to education is augmented 
reality gaming.   Games that are based in the real 
world and augmented with networked data can give 
educators powerful new ways to show relationships 
and connections. Games using marker technology 
often include a flat game board or map which 
becomes a 3D setting when viewed with a mobile 
device or a webcam. This kind of game could easily 
be applied to a range of disciplines, including 
archaeology, history, anthropology, or geography, to 
name a few. Another approach to AR gaming allows 
players or game masters to create virtual people and 
objects, tying them to a specific location in the real 
world. Players interact with these constructs, which 
appear when the player approaches a linked location 
in the real world. 
Augmented reality can also be used to model 
objects, allowing learners to envision how a given 
item would look in different settings. Models can 
be generated rapidly, manipulated, and rotated. 
Students receive immediate visual feedback about 
their designs and ideas in a way that allows them 
to spot inconsistencies or problems that need 
to be addressed. Researchers in the Human 
Interface Technology Laboratory at the University 
of Canterbury in New Zealand have created a tool 
that translates sketches into 3D objects and uses 
augmented reality to allow students to explore the 
physical properties and interactions between objects. 
Simple controls, drawn on slips of paper, are used 
to alter the properties of the sketched objects (see 
a demonstration video at http://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=M4qZ0GLO5_A). At Mauricio De Nassau 
College in Brazil, architecture students are exploring 
the possibilities of using augmented reality to project 
scale models of buildings, cutting down on the time 
required to construct and present architectural 
proposals. For another idea of how augmented 
reality could be applied to the study of architecture, 
see the concept video Realtà Aumentata (http://
vimeo.com/2341387), created as a thesis project by 
T w o  T o  T H r e e  Y e a r s
T H e  H o r i Z o N  r e P o r T  –  2 0 1 0 23
a student at the Valle Giulia Faculty of Architecture 
in Italy.
Augmented books, now just beginning to enter 
the market, are another interesting application of 
this technology. The German company Metaio is 
developing books that include AR elements, such 
as globes that pop up on the pages. The books are 
printed normally; after purchase, consumers install 
special software on their computers and point a 
webcam at the book to see the visualizations. The 
technology allows any existing book to be developed 
into an augmented reality edition after publication; an 
atlas featuring 3D views of geographic locations is 
currently in development. 
A sampling of applications of simple augmented 
reality across disciplines includes the following:
 astronomy. Google’s SkyMap is an augmented 
reality application that overlays information 
about the stars and constellations as a user 
views the sky through the camera on his or her 
mobile phone. Other astronomy applications, 
such as pUniverse, key detailed (and precisely 
oriented) maps of the sky to a user’s location 
and orientation.
 architecture. ARSights is a website and tool 
that allows users to visualize 3D models created 
in Google’s SketchUp. Pointing a webcam at a 
2D printout causes a 3D model to appear on 
the screen. It can be turned and manipulated 
by moving the sheet of paper (see http://www.
inglobetechnologies.com/en/products/arplugin_
su/info.php).
 Computer science. The FourEyes Lab at 
the University of California Santa Barbara is 
creating a finger-sensing augmented reality 
program. The software determines the finger 
positions of the user’s hand (spread out, close-
fisted, etc.) and moves an illustration on the 
screen accordingly (causing a rabbit to crouch 
or jump, for example).
 student guides. Graz University of Technology, 
Austria, has developed campus and museum 
tours using augmented reality. Looking through 
the camera on a mobile phone while walking 
the campus, students see tagged classrooms 
inside the buildings. At the museum, a virtual 
tour guide accompanies users through the halls.

gesTure-based CoMPuTiNg
Time-to-adoption Horizon: four to five Years
For nearly forty years, the keyboard and mouse have been the primary means to interact with computers. The 
Nintendo Wii in 2006 and the Apple iPhone in 2007 signaled the beginning of widespread consumer interest 
in — and acceptance of — interfaces based on natural human gestures. Now, new devices are appearing on 
the market that take advantage of motions that are easy and intuitive to make, allowing us an unprecedented 
level of control over the devices around us. Cameras and sensors pick up the movements of our bodies 
without the need of remotes or handheld tracking tools. The full realization of the potential of gesture-based 
computing is still several years away, especially for education; but we are moving ever closer to a time when 
our gestures will speak for us, even to our machines.
overview
It is already common to interact with a new class 
of devices entirely by using natural gestures. The 
Microsoft Surface, the iPhone and iPod Touch, the 
Nintendo Wii, and other gesture-based systems 
accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other 
ways of touching, hand and arm motions, or body 
movement. These are the first in a growing array 
of alternative input devices that allow computers to 
recognize and interpret natural physical gestures as 
a means of control. We are seeing a gradual shift 
towards interfaces that adapt to — or are built for — 
humans and human movements. Gestural interfaces 
allow users to engage in virtual activities with motion 
and movement similar to what they would use in the 
real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea 
that natural, comfortable motions can be used to 
control computers is opening the way to a host of 
input devices that look and feel very different from 
the keyboard and mouse.
As the underlying technologies evolve, a variety 
of approaches to gesture-based input are being 
explored. The screens of the iPhone and the 
Surface, for instance, react to pressure, motion, 
and the number of fingers touching the devices. The 
iPhone additionally can react to manipulation of the 
device itself — shaking, rotating, tilting, or moving 
the device in space. The Wii and other emerging 
gaming systems use a combination of a handheld, 
accelerometer-based controller and stationary 
infrared sensor to determine position, acceleration, 
and direction. The technology to detect gestural 
movement and to display its results is improving very 
rapidly, increasing the opportunities for this kind of 
interaction. Two new gaming systems are expected 
to be released in 2010 — a Sony platform based 
on a motion sensor code-named Gem, and the 
Microsoft Natal system. Both of these systems take 
a step closer to stripping the gesture-based interface 
of anything beyond the gesture and the machine, at 
least in terms of how it is experienced by the user.
Gesture-based interfaces are changing the way we 
interact with computers, giving us a more intuitive 
way to control devices. They are increasingly built into 
things we can already use; Logitech and Apple have 
brought gesture-based mice to market, and Microsoft 
is developing several models. Smart phones, 
remote controls, and touch-screen computers 
accept gesture input. As more of these devices are 
developed and released, our options for controlling 
a host of electronic devices are expanding. We can 
make music louder or softer by moving a hand, or 
skip a track with the flick of a finger. Apple’s Remote 
app for the iPhone turns the mobile device into a 
remote control for the Apple TV; users can search, 
play, pause, rewind, and so on, just by gliding a finger 
over the iPhone’s surface. Instead of learning where 
to point and click and how to type, we are beginning 
to be able to expect our computers to respond to 
natural movements that make sense to us.
Currently, the most common applications of gesture-
based computing are for computer games, file and 
media browsing, and simulation and training. A 
number of simple mobile applications use gestures. 
Mover lets users “flick” photos and files from one 
phone to another; Shut Up, an app from Nokia, 
silences the phone when the user turns it upside 
down; nAlertme, an anti-theft app, sounds an alarm if 
the phone isn’t shaken in a specific, preset way when 
it is switched on. Some companies are exploring 
further possibilities; for instance, Softkinetic (http://
www.softkinetic.net) develops platforms that support 
gesture-based technology, as well as designing 
custom applications for clients, including interactive 
marketing and consumer electronics as well as 
games and entertainment. 
Because it changes not only the physical and mechan-
ical aspects of interacting with computers, but also our 
perception of what it means to work with a computer, 
gesture-based computing is a potentially transforma-
tive technology. The distance between the user and 
the machine decreases and the sense of power and 
control increases when the machine responds to 
movements that feel natural. Unlike a keyboard and 
mouse, gestural interfaces can often be used by more 
than one person at a time, making it possible to en-
gage in truly collaborative activities and games. Our 
perception of the kinds of activities that computers are 
good for is also altered by gestural interaction — activ-
ities that require sweeping movements, such as many 
sports or exercises, are suited to gestural interfaces.
relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
The kinesthetic nature of gesture-based computing 
will very likely lead to new kinds of teaching or training 
simulations that look, feel, and operate almost 
exactly like their real-world counterparts. The very 
ease and intuitiveness of a gestural interface makes 
the experience seem very natural, and even fun. 
Already, medical students benefit from simulations 
that teach the use of specific tools through gesture-
based interfaces, and it is easy to see how such 
interfaces could be applied in the visual arts and 
other fields where fine motor skills come into play. 
When combined with haptic (touch or motion-based) 
feedback, the overall effect is very compelling.
Larger multi-touch displays support collaborative 
work, allowing multiple users to interact with content 
simultaneously. In schools where the Microsoft Surface 
has been installed in study areas, staff report that 
students naturally gravitate to the devices when they 
want to work together to study collaboratively. The 
promotional video for Microsoft’s Natal system shows a 
family taking on different roles in a racing game — driver, 
pit crew — and suggests that role-playing activities 
where several students work together to perform 
different but related tasks will be a scenario made 
common by tools that use gesture-based computing. 
Pranav Mistry, while at the MIT Media Lab, developed 
a gesture-based system called Sixth Sense that 
uses markers to allow interaction with all sorts of 
real-time information and data in extremely intuitive 
ways. He recently announced the release of the 
platform into open source (http://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=YrtANPtnhyg), which is likely to stimulate a 
raft of new ideas. Mgestyk’s gesture-based system of 
control uses a 3-dimensional camera to capture user 
movements. The system has been demonstrated 
with Microsoft Flight Simulator, and allows players to 
fly a simulated plane by simply moving their hands 
— without any joystick or remote (see http://www.
youtube.com/watch?v=FZyErkPjOR8). The system 
is expected to release to market in late spring 2010 
at a cost comparable to that of a high-end webcam. 
It is not difficult to picture similar applications, a little 
further down the road, that could be used to simulate 
many kinds of experiences.
A sampling of applications for gesture-based 
computing across disciplines includes the following:
 Kinesiology. Dutch company Silverfit uses 
a gesture-based system to deliver fitness 
games designed for the elderly. Used in elder 
care organizations, the games provide gentle 
exercise and “activity of daily life” practice.

 Medicine. Digital Lightbox by BrainLAB is a 
multi-touch screen that allows doctors and 
surgeons to view and manipulate data from MRI, 
CT, x-ray, and other scan images. The system 
integrates with hospital data sources to enable 
health professionals to collaborate throughout 
the cycle of treatment.
 sign Language. Researchers at Georgia 
Tech University have developed gesture-based 
games designed to help deaf children learn 
sign language. Deaf children of hearing parents 
often lack opportunities to pick up language 
serendipitously in the way hearing children do; 
the game provides an opportunity for incidental 
learning.
 surgical Training. After discovering the 
significant improvement in dexterity that 
surgeons-in-training gained from interacting with 
the Wii (in one study, those who warmed up with 
the Wii scored an average of 48% higher on tool 
tests and simulated surgical procedures than 
those who did not), researchers are developing 
a set of Wii-based medical training materials for 
students in developing countries.

Time-to-adoption Horizon: four to five Years
Visual data analysis blends highly advanced computational methods with sophisticated graphics engines to tap 
the extraordinary ability of humans to see patterns and structure in even the most complex visual presentations. 
Currently applied to massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets, such as those generated in studies of 
astrophysical, fluidic, biological, and other complex processes, the techniques have become sophisticated 
enough to allow the interactive manipulation of variables in real time. Ultra high-resolution displays allow teams 
of researchers to zoom in to examine specific aspects of the renderings, or to navigate along interesting 
visual pathways, following their intuitions and even hunches to see where they may lead. New research is 
now beginning to apply these sorts of tools to the social sciences and humanities as well, and the techniques 
offer considerable promise in helping us understand complex social processes like learning, political and 
organizational change, and the diffusion of knowledge.
overview
Over the past century, data collection, storage, 
transmission, and display has changed dramatically, 
and scholars have undergone a profound 
transformation in the way they approach data-
related tasks. Data collection and compilation is no 
longer the tedious, manual process it once was, 
and tools to analyze, interpret, and display data are 
increasingly sophisticated, and their use routine in 
many disciplines. The options for illustrating trends, 
relationships, and cause and effect have exploded, 
and it is now a relatively simple matter for anyone 
to do the sorts of analyses that were once only the 
province of statisticians and engineers.
In advanced research settings, scientists and others 
studying massively complex systems generate 
mountains of data, and have developed a wide 
variety of new tools and techniques to allow those 
data to be interpreted holistically, and to expose 
meaningful patterns and structure, trends and 
exceptions, and more. Researchers that work with 
data sets from experiments or simulations, such as 
computational fluid dynamics, astrophysics, climate 
study, or medicine draw on techniques from the 
study of visualization, data mining, and statistics to 
create useful ways to investigate and understand 
what they have found. 
The blending of these disciplines has given rise to 
the new field of visual data analysis, which is not 
only characterized by its focus on making use of the 
pattern matching skills that seem to be hard-wired 
into the human brain, but also in the way in which 
it facilitates the work of teams working in concert to 
tease out meaning from complex sets of information. 
While the most sophisticated tools are still mostly 
found in research settings, a variety of tools are 
emerging that make it possible for almost anyone 
with an analytical bent to easily interpret all sorts of 
data. 
Self-organizing maps are an approach that mimics the 
way our brains organize multi-faceted relationships; 
they create a grid of “neuronal units” such that 
neighboring units recognize similar data, reinforcing 
important patterns so that they can be seen. Cluster 
analysis is a set of mathematical techniques for 
partitioning a series of data objects into a smaller 
amount of groups, or clusters, so that the data objects 
within one cluster are more similar to each other than 
to those in other clusters. Visual, interactive principal 
components analysis is a technique once only 
available to statisticians that is now commonly used 
to identify hidden trends and data correlations in 
multidimensional data sets. Gapminder (http://www.
gapminder.org/), for example, uses this approach in 
its analysis of multivariate datasets over time.
These sorts of tools are now finding their way into 
common use in many other disciplines, where the 
analytical needs are not necessarily computational; 
visualization techniques have even begun to emerge 
for textual analysis and basic observation. Many 
are free or very inexpensive, bringing the ability 
to engage in rich visual interpretation to virtually 
anyone. 
Online services such as Many Eyes, Wordle,   
Flowing Data, and Gapminder accept uploaded 
data and allow the user to configure the output to 
varying degrees. Many Eyes, for instance, allows 
people to learn how to create visualizations, to share 
and visualize their own data, and to create new 
visualizations from data contributed by others. Some, 
like Roambi, have mobile counterparts, making it 
easy to carry interactive, visual representations of 
data wherever one goes. Even quite public data, 
such as the posts made in Twitter, can be rendered 
visually to reveal creative insights. For instance, New 
Political Interfaces (http://newpoliticalinterfaces.org) 
created a visualization examining political topics as 
expressed on Twitter, charting which topics are — 
and are not — being discussed by politicians, news 
outlets, and other sources.
relevance for Teaching, Learning,  
or Creative inquiry
As stated previously, one of the most compelling 
aspects of visual data analysis is in the ways it 
augments the natural abilities humans have to seek 
and find patterns in what they see. By manipulating 
variables, or simply seeing them change over time 
(as Gapminder has done so famously) if patterns 
exist (or if they don’t), that fact is easily discoverable. 
Such tools have applicability in nearly every field. 
As the tools, their capabilities, and their variety 
continue to expand, their use is already making its 
way out of scientific and engineering labs and into 
business and social research. Creative inquiry is 
benefiting from a wide range of new tools that are 
exposing trends and relationships among both 
qualitative and quantitative variables in real time, and 
making longitudinal relationships easier to find and 
interpret than ever. Textual analysis is an area that 
tools like Wordle have revealed as especially suited 
to visual techniques. 
The promise for teaching and learning is further 
afield, but because of the intuitive ways in which it can 
expose intricate relationships to even the uninitiated, 
there is tremendous opportunity to integrate visual 
data analysis into undergraduate research, even in 
survey courses. Models of complex processes in 
quantum physics, organic chemistry, medicine, or 
economics are just a few of the ways in which the 
outcomes of visual data analysis can be applied to 
learning situations. 
Visual data analysis may help expand our 
understanding of learning itself. Learning is one 
of the most complex of social processes, with a 
myriad of variables interacting in ways that are not 
well understood, making it an ideal focus for the 
search for patterns. Related to this is the opportunity 
to understand the variables influencing informal 
learning and the social networking processes at 
work in the formation of learning communities. The 
tools for such analyses exist today; what is needed 
are ways to balance privacy with the kinds of data 
capture that can inform such work.
A sampling of visual data analysis applications for a 
variety of purposes includes the following:
 astrophysics. Harvard scientists are using 
data visualization from the Chandra X-Ray 
Observatory to measure the expansion velocity 
of supernova remnants. Visual data analysis has 
also enabled scientists to more fully understand 
the effects of multiple points of explosion in a 
supernova.
 fluid dynamics and Human Physiology. 
Researchers working with Amira, a visual data 
analysis tool created originally at the Zuse 
Institute in Berlin, have created a range of 
models of biological processes from MRI data, 
fluid flows, and other complex datasets. Insights 
from the study of fluid dynamics over complex 
surfaces informed work that models blood flows 
and arterial mapping.

 Marine geology. Published by the Lamont-
Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia 
University, the Virtual Ocean, similar to Google 
Earth, offers students a three-dimensional view 
of the Earth’s oceans (http://www.virtualocean.
org).
 Composition and rhetoric. Using tools like 
Many Eyes and Wordle, students can easily 
analyze the contents of their papers visually 
for insights into what points might need further 
development, and whether or not certain 
language has been overused.

The Horizon Report is produced each fall using a 
carefully constructed process that is informed by both 
primary and secondary research. Nearly a hundred 
technologies, as well as dozens of meaningful trends 
and challenges are examined for possible inclusion 
in the report each year; an internationally renowned 
Advisory Board examines each topic in progressively 
more detail, reducing the set until the final listing of 
technologies, trends, and challenges is selected. 
The entire process takes place online and is fully 
documented at horizon.wiki.nmc.org. 
The process of selection, a modified Delphi process 
now refined over several years of producing Horizon 
Reports, begins each summer as the Advisory Board 
is convened. About half of  the forty or so members 
are newly chosen each year, and the board as a 
whole is intended to represent a wide range of 
backgrounds, nationalities, and interests. By design, 
at least one-third of the Advisory Board represent 
countries outside of North America. To date, more 
than 400 internationally recognized practitioners 
and experts have participated. Once the Advisory 
Board is constituted, their work begins with a 
systematic review of the literature — press clippings, 
reports, essays, and other materials — that pertain 
to emerging technology. Advisory Board members 
are provided with an extensive set of background 
materials when the project begins, and then are 
asked to comment on them, identify those which 
seem especially worthwhile, and also add to the set. 
A carefully selected set of RSS feeds from nearly 50 
leading publications ensures that these resources 
stay current as the project progresses, and they 
are used to inform the thinking of the participants 
through the process. 
Following the review of the literature, the Advisory 
Board engages in the process of addressing the 
five research questions that are at the core of the 
Horizon Project. These questions are the same each 
year, and are designed to elicit a comprehensive 
listing of interesting technologies, challenges, and 
trends from the Advisory Board:
1 What would you list among the established 
technologies that learning-focused institutions 
should all be using broadly today to support or 
enhance teaching, learning, or creative inquiry?
2 What technologies that have a solid user base 
in consumer, entertainment, or other industries 
should learning-focused institutions be actively 
looking for ways to apply?
3 What are the key emerging technologies you 
see developing to the point that learning-
focused institutions should begin to take 
notice during the next three to five years? What 
organizations or companies are the leaders in 
these technologies?
4 What do you see as the key challenges related 
to teaching, learning, or creative inquiry that 
learning-focused institutions will face during 
the next five years? 
5 What trends do you expect to have a significant 
impact on the ways in which learning-focused 
institutions approach our core missions of 
teaching, research, and service?
One of the Advisory Board’s most important tasks 
is to answer these five questions as systematically 
and broadly as possible, so as to generate a large 
number of potential topics to consider. As the last step 
in this process, past Horizon Reports are revisited 
and the Advisory Board is asked to comment on 
the current state of technologies, challenges, and 
trends identified in previous years, and to look for 
metatrends that may be evident only across the 
results of multiple years. 
To create the 2010 Horizon Report, the 47 
members of this year’s Advisory Board engaged in 
a comprehensive review and analysis of research, 
articles, papers, blogs, and interviews; discussed 
existing applications; and brainstormed new ones. A 
key criterion was the potential relevance of the topics 
to teaching, learning, research, or creative inquiry. 
Once this foundational work was completed, the 
Advisory Board moved to a unique consensus-
building process that uses an iterative Delphi-based 
methodology. In the first step, the responses to the 
research questions were systematically ranked and 
placed into adoption horizons by each Advisory 
Board member in a multi-vote system that allowed 
members to weight their selections. These rankings 
were compiled into a collective set of responses. 
From the more than 110 technologies originally 
considered, the twelve that emerged at the top 
of the initial ranking process — four per adoption 
horizon — were further researched. Once this “short 
list” was identified, the potential applications of 
these important technologies were further explored 
by higher education practitioners who were either 
knowledgeable about them, or interested in thinking 
about how they might be used. A significant amount of 
time was spent researching applications or potential 
applications for each of the areas that would be of 
interest to practitioners. 
Each of these twelve was written up in the format 
of the Horizon Report. With the benefit of knowing 
how each topic would look in the report, the “short 
list” was then ranked yet again, this time with a 
reverse ranking approach. The six technologies and 
applications that emerged at the top of the rankings 
— two per adoption horizon — are detailed in the 
preceding sections, and those descriptions are the 
final results of this process. 
An ongoing component of the project involves 
a special set of Delicious links that have been 
established to help extend the findings of the project 
and allow new information to be shared within the 
community. These Delicious tags are listed under 
the “Further Reading” section of each of the six 
topic areas, and readers are invited to view the 
hundreds of resources used in producing the report. 
These links are enhanced by a vibrant community 
that contributes new information daily. Readers are 
encouraged to be part of this community and add 
their own examples and readings to these dynamic 
lists by tagging them for inclusion in each category.
