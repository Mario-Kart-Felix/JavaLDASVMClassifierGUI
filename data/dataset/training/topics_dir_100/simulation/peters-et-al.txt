North Carolina (SAM)
Purpose: The Study of Urgent® PC vs Sham Effectiveness in Treatment of
Overactive Bladder Symptoms (SUmiT) was a multicenter, double-blind, ran-
domized, controlled trial comparing the efficacy of percutaneous tibial nerve
stimulation to sham through 12 weeks of therapy. The improvement in global
response assessment, voiding diary parameters, and overactive bladder and
quality of life questionnaires was evaluated.
Materials and Methods: A total of 220 adults with overactive bladder symptoms
were randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of treatment with weekly percutaneous tibial
nerve stimulation or sham therapy. Overactive bladder and quality of life ques-
tionnaires as well as 3-day voiding diaries were completed at baseline and at 13
weeks. Subject global response assessments were completed at week 13.
Results: The 13-week subject global response assessment for overall bladder
symptoms demonstrated that percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation subjects
achieved statistically significant improvement in bladder symptoms with 54.5%
reporting moderately or markedly improved responses compared to 20.9% of
sham subjects from baseline (p 0.001). All individual global response assess-
ment subset symptom components demonstrated statistically significant im-
provement from baseline to 13 weeks for percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation
compared to sham. Voiding diary parameters after 12 weeks of therapy showed
percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation subjects had statistically significant im-
provements in frequency, nighttime voids, voids with moderate to severe urgency
and urinary urge incontinence episodes compared to sham. No serious device
related adverse events or malfunctions were reported.
Conclusions: This pivotal multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham con-
trolled trial provides level I evidence that percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation
therapy is safe and effective in treating overactive bladder symptoms. The com-
pelling efficacy of percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation demonstrated in this
trial is consistent with other recently published reports and supports the use of
peripheral neuromodulation therapy for overactive bladder.

PERCUTANEOUS TIBIAL NERVE STIMULATION VERSUS SHAM FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER 1439creasing along with the aging baby boomer popula-
tion.2 OAB symptoms may decrease quality of life,
increase social isolation, and result in increased
morbidity such as falls and fractures.3 Following
behavioral and pelvic floor therapies, antimusca-
rinic agents are the mainstay of treatment. How-
ever, lack of efficacy, side effects and costs appear to
limit the adherence to this therapy, and ultimately
limit benefit for many patients.4 Surgical treatment
such as augmentation cystoplasty is invasive and is
increasingly limited to rare cases. Neuromodulation
of the sacral nerves requires a permanent surgical
implant with up to a 40% complication rate in 5
years.5,6 Pudendal nerve stimulation has recently
been more closely studied but also requires surgical
implantation.
Historically Stoller reported the use of PTNS as
early as 1987 for lower urinary tract symptoms.
Several other investigators have since reported com-
pelling results with the use of PTNS for the treat-
ment of OAB, some of which have provided highly
favorable comparisons to pharmacotherapy.7–15
According to the published literature, subjects with
OAB in placebo controlled drug trials have a placebo
response rate varying from 9% to 64% for some
urinary incontinence symptoms.16,17 Of note, the im-
pact of a validated placebo response during therapy
with implantable neuromodulators for sacral and
pudendal nerves has not been studied to date to our
knowledge, as prior studies of implanted neuro-
modulators have used an on/off design in implanted
treatment responders.18
This pivotal level I study reports the outcomes of
a multicenter trial to assess the efficacy of PTNS
compared to a validated sham intervention in sub-
jects with OAB. The previously published validated
sham intervention simulates PTNS treatment sen-
sory effects without delivering a therapeutic effect
and maintains the double-blind study design.19 This
unique validated study design is the first random-
ized and controlled neuromodulation study, and spe-
cific to PTNS corroborates existing published PTNS
efficacy data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The SUmiT trial was an institutional review board ap-
proved, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial con-
ducted by urologists, urogynecologists, gynecologists and
nurse practitioners across 23 geographically diverse clin-
ical centers in the United States (Appendix 1). The pri-
mary end point of this trial was to assess the efficacy of
PTNS compared to an inactive sham intervention in sub-
jects with overall OAB symptoms in an intent to treat
analysis. A responder was defined as reporting bladder
symptoms as moderately or markedly improved on a
7-level GRA at week 13 after completing 12, 30-minute,
consecutive weekly intervention sessions. Secondary end
points included change in individual GRA subset symp-tom components (urgency, frequency and urinary urge
incontinence), 3-day voiding diary parameters (frequency,
nighttime voids, voids with moderate to severe urgency,
urinary urge incontinence episodes and voided volume),
OAB-q scores and SF-36™ quality of life scores at week 13
compared to baseline.20–22 To test the validity of the sham
at the end of the trial, subjects were also asked to identify
which intervention they believed they received during the
study.
From September 2008 to January 2009 subjects were
recruited by investigator sites assisted by limited recruit-
ment advertising. The study inclusion and exclusion are
given in Appendix 2. During the course of the trial con-
comitant OAB medical therapies were not used. On-site
training of investigators and research staff included study
protocol lecture, demonstration of blinding apparatus
setup, use of the Urgent PC system according to manufac-
turer instructions for use, and use of a TENS unit (Biostim
M7 TENS unit, Biomedical Life Systems, Vista, Califor-
nia) and Streitberger placebo needles (Asia-Med, Munich,
Germany) for sham subjects.23 Subjects and study coordi-
nators who administered questionnaires and reviewed
voiding diary outcome measures were blinded to the as-
signed treatment intervention throughout the trial. All
subjects were randomized 1:1 at the first intervention visit
to PTNS or sham using a random block design stratified
by investigational site.
During the intervention session subjects were in a com-
fortable seated or reclining position with lower extremi-
ties blocked and draped from view. All subjects had 3
electrode pads placed as shown in figure 1 to standardize
the perception of the intervention between the 2 treat-
ment arms. Additionally, all subjects were informed that
they may or may not feel a sensory stimulus effect on their
lower extremities as a result of the intervention. Subjects
in both study groups received 12 weekly 30-minute inter-
vention sessions and were queried about adverse events.
For PTNS subjects a 34 gauge needle electrode was
inserted at a 60 degree angle approximately 5 cm cephalad
to the medial malleolus and slightly posterior to the tibia
(fig. 1, A). A PTNS surface electrode was placed on the
ipsilateral calcaneus as well as 2 inactive sham surface
electrodes, 1 under the little toe and 1 on the top of the
foot. When the PTNS lead set was connected to the Urgent
PC stimulator, a current level of 0.5 to 9 mA at 20 Hz was
selected based on each subject’s foot and plantar motor
and sensory responses.
In the sham group a Streitberger placebo needle was
used to simulate the location and sensation of PTNS nee-
dle electrode insertion. The Streitberger 2-piece needle isFigure 1. PTNS (A) and sham (B) setup
PERCUTANEOUS TIBIAL NERVE STIMULATION VERSUS SHAM FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER1440comprised of a needle handle and blunt tip needle shaft,
and causes the sensation of a slight prick when touched to
the skin. However, the blunt tip needle shaft retracts into
the handle as it appears to enter the skin, with no punc-
turing of the skin actually occurring. Therefore, no tibial
nerve stimulation could occur without the insertion of a
needle close to the tibial nerve. An inactive PTNS surface
electrode was placed on the ipsilateral calcaneus. Two
active TENS surface electrodes were placed, 1 under the
little toe and 1 on the top of the foot. Sham stimulation
parameters were determined based on subject first sen-
sory level of localized stimulation through a TENS unit
(fig. 1, B). Care was taken to avoid surface electrode place-
ment over reflexology areas for major organs or the tibial
nerve. The audible sounds produced by the Urgent PC
stimulator in the PTNS treatment arm were also repro-
duced during the sham intervention to decrease auditory
variation between study arms. Thus, the sham group re-
ceived an intervention similar to the PTNS group without
receiving active therapy.
A sample size estimate of approximately 214 subjects,
107 per study arm, was calculated using a 2-sided Fisher’s
exact binomial test based on an estimated 60% responder
rate in the PTNS group and a 40% responder rate in the
sham group with a 5% significance level and 80% power.
An intent to treat analysis which counted any subject not
assessed at 13 weeks as a failure was planned for the
study primary end point. Data were entered into a double
entry, password protected Clindex® Clinical Trial and
Data Management System. All data including voiding di-
aries were analyzed by an independent biostatistician (In-
tegra Group, Brooklyn Park, Minnesota) using SAS® ver-
sion 9.2. Mean values were analyzed for significant change
using a 2-sided paired t test and proportions were ana-
lyzed using chi-square methodology. Median values were
analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test with p 0.05

A total of 220 ambulatory adult subjects were en-
rolled and randomized with 110 subjects in each arm
(fig. 2). Baseline characteristics were homogeneous
across intervention arms with females accounting
for 86 (78.2%) PTNS subjects and 88 (80.0%) sham
subjects. Mean age of subjects was 62.5 and 60.2
years, with 56 (50.9%) and 46 (41.8%) older than
65 years for PTNS and sham subjects, respectively
(table 1).
An intent to treat analysis of the primary end
point demonstrated 54.5% (60 of 110) of PTNS sub-
jects compared to 20.9% (23 of 110) of sham subjects
responding to the GRA as being moderately or mark-
edly improved on overall bladder symptoms from
baseline (fig. 3). The primary end point analysis
showed that PTNS was effective and statistically
significant (p 0.001) compared to the sham for
improvement in overall bladder symptoms. The pri-
mary end point in an as-followed completer analysis
of those subjects assessed at 13 weeks demonstrated
similar statistically significant results with 58.3%
(60 of 103) of PTNS subjects compared to 21.9% (23
of 105) of sham subjects reporting GRA as being
moderately or markedly improved on overall bladder
symptoms from baseline (table 2). Assessment of
treatment effects for the primary efficacy end point
by investigational site showed no evidence of a sig-
nificant association between investigational site and
treatment outcome.

PERCUTANEOUS TIBIAL NERVE STIMULATION VERSUS SHAM FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER 1441The secondary end point of the GRA subset symp-
tom components for urinary urgency, frequency and
urge incontinence demonstrated that PTNS subject
results were statistically significant for improve-
ment on all GRA subsets compared to sham. This
finding was determined by subject responses of mod-
erately or markedly improved after 13 weeks.
The 3-day voiding diary daily results showed PTNS
to be statistically superior to sham in reducing fre-
quency, urinary urge incontinence episodes, nighttime
voids, urgency episodes and voids with moderate to
severe urgency (table 3). For voided volume PTNS
subjects had a statistically significant increase in
voided volume from baseline to 13 weeks, whereas the
sham group did not. The difference between groups
was not statistically significant for voided volume.
The condition specific OAB-q symptom severity
score and quality of life scores showed statistically
significant improvement in the PTNS group compared
to the sham group (table 4). The SF-36 general health
survey quality of life scores showed statistically signif-
icant improvement from baseline compared to 13
weeks in the PTNS group in the physical (p  0.002)
and mental (p  0.049) domain scales. The sham arm
did not show statistically significant improvement

in the sham group. In addition, no systemic adverse
events were experienced in either group.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study provide strong scientific evi-
dence that the therapeutic effect of PTNS is due to the
stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve and is not due
to a placebo effect. The intent to treat primary end

PERCUTANEOUS TIBIAL NERVE STIMULATION VERSUS SHAM FOR OVERACTIVE BLADDER1442point of the study demonstrated that 54.5% of PTNS
subjects and 20.9% of sham subjects reported GRA as
being moderately or markedly improved in their over-
all bladder symptoms from baseline. The primary end
point calculation used a conservative intent to treat
analysis where all subjects lost to followup were ana-
lyzed as failures to limit bias to the success rate caused
by patient dropouts.
With PTNS there was a statistically significant im-
provement in all GRA subset components compared to
the sham intervention. Additionally, objective voiding
diary parameters of frequency, urinary urge inconti-
nence episodes, nighttime voids, urgency episodes and
voids with moderate to severe urgency were statisti-
cally significant in the PTNS group compared to sham.
OAB-q and SF-36 quality of life questionnaires pro-
vided further support of the primary and other second-
ary end points for the efficacy of PTNS.
This is the first neuromodulation study to use a
published validated sham component.19 When sub-
jects were asked which intervention they believed they
received during the study, there was no statistical
difference between the groups. This finding confirms
that neither group knew which treatment they re-
ceived, and affirms the integrity of the sham technique
and design, further strengthening the validity of these
results.
A strength of this study design is the use of a vali-
dated realistic sham intervention which would be dif-
ficult to replicate for implantable neuromodulation
systems that require surgical placement. An advan-
tage of PTNS is that it does not require surgical im-
plantation of a power supply, leads or electrodes, or the
use of prophylactic antibiotics.
The results of this study provide level I evidence
that PTNS is safe and effective in improving OAB. A
recent multicenter, randomized trial (OrBIT Trial)
demonstrated that a series of 12 weekly PTNS treat-
ments was comparable to extended-release tolterodine
in treating OAB symptoms.7 A long-term followup of
the OrBIT Trial evaluated the durability of PTNS
benefits and found that 96% of 12-week responder
subjects who continued periodic treatments sustained
OAB symptom improvements at 1 year followup.24 No
significant PTNS related adverse events were noted in
these trials.
A limitation of this study is the relatively short
followup period of 12 weeks. However, the 12-week
followup corresponds to the recommended treatment
protocol for PTNS and additional clinical improvement
in the sham arm was not expected to increase after
this followup period. This is also the usual therapeutic
interval used for OAB drug trials.
PTNS represents an excellent option for patients
who are unwilling or unable to tolerate systemic anti-
muscarinic adverse events (dry mouth, constipation,
central nervous system effects), those with conditions
refractory to medical and behavioral treatments andthose who do not wish to have or are not candidates for
an implantable surgical device or reconstructive sur-
gery. Future studies of PTNS in combination with
behavioral or pharmacotherapy are needed as PTNS
does not preclude these interventions. Given that
PTNS has been shown in rigorous clinical studies to be
effective, durable and comparable to drug therapy in
effectiveness, PTNS should be considered a viable
treatment for OAB symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS
This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, sham
controlled trial provides level I clinical evidence that
PTNS therapy is safe and effective in treating OAB
symptoms. The compelling efficacy of PTNS as dem-
onstrated in this trial, along with other recently
published reports, should have a significant impact
on the future clinical management of OAB.
