Aims In chronic heart failure (CHF), reduced vagal activity correlates with increased mortality and acute decompensation.
Experimentally, chronic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) improved left ventricular (LV) function and survival; clinically,
it is used for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy. We assessed safety and tolerability of chronic VNS in sympto-
matic CHF patients, using a novel implantable nerve stimulation system. The secondary goal was to obtain preliminary
data on clinical efficacy.
Methods and
results
This multi-centre, open-label phase II, two-staged study (8-patient feasibility phase plus 24-patient safety and toler-
ability phase) enrolled 32 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II– IV patients [age 56+11 years, LV ejection
fraction (LVEF) 23+ 8%]. Right cervical VNS with CardioFit (BioControl Medical) implantable system started 2–4
weeks after implant, slowly raising intensity; patients were followed 3 and 6 months thereafter with optional
1-year follow-up. Overall, 26 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 13 of 32 patients (40.6%), including three
deaths and two clearly device-related AEs (post-operative pulmonary oedema, need of surgical revision). Expected
non-serious device-related AEs (cough, dysphonia, and stimulation-related pain) occurred early but were reduced
and disappeared after stimulation intensity adjustment. There were significant improvements (P , 0.001) in NYHA
class quality of life, 6-minute walk test (from 411+76 to 471+ 111 m), LVEF (from 22+7 to 29+8%), and LV
systolic volumes (P ¼ 0.02). These improvements were maintained at 1 year.
Conclusions This open-label study shows that chronic VNS in CHF patients with severe systolic dysfunction may be safe and tol-
erable and may improve quality of life and LV function. A controlled clinical trial appears warranted.

Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is characterized by an autonomic imbalance with
withdrawal of vagal activity and increased sympathetic activity.
Whereas cardiac adrenergic drive initially supports the
performance of the failing heart, long-term activation of the sym-
pathetic nervous system is deleterious and, accordingly,
beta-adrenergic blocker treatment is beneficial.1
A wealth of experimental and clinical studies suggested that
reduced or increased vagal activity could modify the risk for

ischaemia-related mortality.2 –6 Reduced vagal activity is associated
with increased mortality also in chronic heart failure (CHF)
patients7 and further vagal withdrawal precedes acute decompen-
sation.8 In three different experimental models of HF, chronic
vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) significantly improved left ventricu-
lar (LV) haemodynamics,9– 11 and decreased mortality.9 Clinically,
VNS is used in drug-refractory epilepsy12,13 and, more recently,
depression.14
The primary goal of the present study was to assess safety and
tolerability of chronic VNS in symptomatic CHF patients with
severe LV systolic dysfunction, using a novel implantable nerve
stimulation system. The secondary objective was to obtain prelimi-
nary data on clinical efficacy.
Methods
This single-arm, open-label interventional phase II study, followed a
two-staged approach: a first, single-centre feasibility phase, already
reported,15 followed by an international multicentre phase assessing
safety and tolerability of chronic VNS with the CardioFitTM system in
patients with symptomatic CHF. The protocol was approved by all
Ethics Committees and every patient signed an informed consent.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients with a history of CHF, age 18–75 years, and New York Heart
Association (NYHA) functional class II– III were eligible. Main inclusion
criteria were presence of sinus rhythm with a 24-h Holter heart rate
(HR) of 60–110 b.p.m., optimal medical treatment with no change in
the previous 3 months, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35%, and capa-
bility to perform a 6-minute walk test. Exclusion criteria included:
acute coronary syndrome, coronary re-vascularization or an episode
of NYHA class IV CHF in the previous 3 months; previous stroke;
history of acute myocarditis, haemodynamically significant valve
disease; severe renal or hepatic failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mel-
litus or diabetic neuropathy; previous neck surgery; active peptic
disease or history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding; asthma or
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; PR interval .240 ms,
second or third degree atrioventricular block; atrial fibrillation or
flutter in the previous 3 months; or candidacy for cardiac resynchroni-
zation device implantation.
Vagus nerve stimulation system
The CardioFitTM system (BioControl Medical Ltd, Yehud, Israel) is an
implantable vagal neurostimulator system delivering low current elec-
trical pulses, remotely programmable using a dedicated wireless com-
munication system, designed to sense HR (via a standard intracardiac
electrode) and deliver stimulation at a variable delay (70–325 ms)
from the R-wave. A bradycardia limit causing interruption of vagal
stimulation was set at 55 b.p.m.
The stimulation lead is an asymmetric bipolar multi-contact cuff
electrode specifically designed for cathodic induction of action poten-
tials, while simultaneously applying asymmetrical anodal blocks
expected to lead to preferential, but not exclusive, activation of
vagal efferent fibres. Electrode size can be tailored to each patient
choosing from five different internal diameters of 2.25–3.25 mm.
CardioFit implantation procedure
The implantation procedure has been described.15 Following position-
ing under local anaesthesia of an intracardiac sensing electrode, the
right vagus was exposed through a latero-cervical incision under
general anaesthesia, the appropriate size of the cuff electrode was
determined and the cuff positioned. The stimulation lead was then tun-
nelled and connected with the intracardiac sensing electrode to a sub-
cutaneous stimulator in the right subclavicular region. Prior to closure,
a continuity test and HR reduction by stimulation test were performed
to ensure proper device functioning.
Stimulation protocol
Approximately 3 weeks after implantation, the device was first acti-
vated. Stimulation started with an amplitude of 0.5 mA at a frequency
of one stimulation pulse per heart beat given for 2 s ("ON time") and
paused for 6 s ("OFF time"). During the 3-week up-titration phase,
patients underwent 3 sessions/week; in each session, amplitude was
raised in steps of 0.2 mA by a maximum of 1 mA. Increase in amplitude
was achieved according to the subject sensations, so that if the patient
felt stimulations and experienced discomfort at a certain amplitude, the
current was not further increased in that session and the stimulation
was left at a level just below that amplitude. Concomitantly, the ON
and OFF times were progressively prolonged to a maximum time of
10 and 30 s, respectively. As with current amplitude, prolongation of
ON/OFF times also was based upon the patient sensations. The
duty cycle was defined as the percentage of time the stimulation was
ON. For instance, a sequence of 8 s (2 s ON, 6 s OFF) would rep-
resent a duty cycle of 25% (2/8). To ensure that the duty cycle
would not exceed the pre-specified target of 25%, prolonged
periods with no stimulation were entered after a certain sequence
of ON-OFF repetitions. For instance, after 20 repetitions of the 10 s
ON 20 s OFF sequence, (600 s) a pause of 200 s would allow an
overall duty cycle of 25% (200 s stimulation/800 s time). Targets
were the attainment of either 5.5 mA, HR reduction of 5–10 beats,
or onset of side-effects. Stimulation parameters were further fine-
tuned during follow-up visits in case of significant side-effects, or sub-
optimal HR reductions.
Evaluation and follow-up
Follow-up visits were conducted 1, 3, and 6 months after the optimiz-
ation period. The patients were examined for physical signs and asked
for any symptoms or adverse events (AEs). Investigation performed at
baseline, 3, and 6 months included clinical findings, 12-lead electrocar-
diogram (ECG), QoL questionnaire (The Minnesota Living with Heart
Failurew Questionnaire, MLwHF) a 6-minute walk test, blood tests,
echocardiography, and 24-h Holter recording. Echocardiograms were
digitally recorded for subsequent off-line blinded evaluation in a core
laboratory. Measurements were performed in triplicate and averaged.
The following indices of time domain HR variability were derived from
the Holter recording read blindly in a core laboratory: standard devi-
ation of the normal to normal interval (SDNN), mean squared succes-
sive difference (MSSD), and percentage of normal to normal intervals
differing .50 ms from the previous one (pNN50). At the end of the
6-month follow-up period, patients were offered the choice of enter-
ing an optional extended follow-up phase with repetition of the full set
of investigation at 12 months.
Endpoints and sample size
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of all system
and procedure-related AEs. The AE-related case report forms were
subjected to careful independent monitoring and queries were issued
to clarify all aspects that were not sufficiently described or were
ambiguous. After all queries were cleared and a consensus was
reached between the investigator and the monitor, the AEs were
further evaluated and validated by members of the Steering Committee.
G.M. De Ferrari et al.848
The secondary endpoints were the changes between baseline and
the 6-month follow-up visit in: NYHA class, quality of life
(MLwHFw), 6-minute walk test, LVEF, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic
volumes. The sample size was based on the change between baseline
and 6 months in MLwHFw quality of life. Anticipating a baseline value
of 50+ 15 points, thirty patients allowed 80% power to detect a 12
point difference with alpha ¼ 0.05 (two-tailed).
Statistical analysis
Since the primary endpoint of the study was safety (the occurrence of
all system and procedure-related side-effects), we considered appro-
priate to report, as main result, the combined analysis of the two
phases of the study. Regarding efficacy, separate data on the second
set of patients (n ¼ 24) are also provided. Finally, all data available
for the 1-year follow-up are reported.
Data are expressed as mean+ SD or median and inter-quartile
range for normal and non-normal distributions, respectively. Data on
variables explored at baseline, 3, and 6-month follow-up were analysed
with repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple
comparison test or Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA followed by Wilcoxon
signed rank test. One year data were compared with baseline data
with paired t-test or Mann–Whitney test, as appropriate. A P-value
of 0.05 was considered the limit for significance. All P-values reported
are corrected for multiple comparisons, unless otherwise specified.
Statistical analysis was performed with MedCalc 10.1.3 for PC.
Results
Thirty-two patients were enrolled (Table 1 shows their main base-
line clinical characteristics). Two NYHA class IV patients were
enrolled following agreement by the local Ethics Committee and
the Sponsor given the absence, in these patients, of any possible
alternative treatment.
Surgery and hospitalization
The CardioFit implantation procedure lasted an overall average of
144 min (46 min intracardiac sensing lead implantation, 68 min cer-
vical vagus stimulation lead implantation, 30 min battery connec-
tion, and implantation). Implant success rate was 100% and no
implantation failure occurred. Acutely, patients responded to
VNS with a HR reduction of 7+2 b.p.m. Patients were discharged
from hospital a median of 4 days (range 2–13) after the interven-
tion on their usual treatment.
Up-titration of vagus nerve stimulation
The intensity of stimulation reached at the end of the titration
phase was 4.1+ 1.2 mA (range 1.1–5.5 mA). The up-titration
was limited by patient’s discomfort or pain in the majority of
patients (23/32, 72%), by attainment of an amplitude of 5.5 mA
in six patients (19%), by the attainment of an acute HR decrease
.5 b.p.m. in one patient (3%), and by the attainment of both an
amplitude of 5.5 mA and an acute HR decrease .5 b.p.m. in
two patients (6%). The average duty cycle (percent of active stimu-
lation) was 21+ 5%.
Safety evaluation
During the 6-month duration of the study, the overall number of
serious AEs (SAEs) was 26, occurring in 13 of 32 patients
(40.6%, Table 2 for full disclosure of SAEs). Two SAEs (in 2 of
32 patients, 6.2%) were clearly related to the procedure: one
episode of acute pulmonary oedema occurring after the surgical
implantation and treated with i.v. diuretics and one case of surgical
revision of the device consisting in opening the generator pocket
and tightening a loose electrode connector. Atrial fibrillation in
one patient leading to electrical cardioversion was considered to
be possibly related to the experimental treatment similarly to an
episode of ulcer bleeding in a patient with Helicobacter pylori posi-
tive tests. The investigators considered expected and likely unre-
lated to the investigational procedure the following SAEs: three
cases of death, all occurring before the third month and due to
intractable HF (in two class III and one class IV patient); eight epi-
sodes of cardiac decompensation observed in five patients, one
pleural effusion in one and a sequence of five appropriate implan-
table cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks leading to hospitaliz-
ation in one patient.
The following non-SAEs were considered to be related to the
investigational device: pain at stimulation site in six patients,
cough in five, dysphonia in four, mandibular pain in three, and
stimulus artefact on ECG in one patient. These side effects were
expected on the basis of the previous experience with VNS for
drug-resistant epilepsy. They were reduced and eventually disap-
peared after fine-tuning of the stimulation intensity. There were
also 11 AEs considered by the local investigator not to be
related to the investigational device.
No interaction was noticed between the investigational device
and the ICD, implanted in 19 out of 32 patients; no episodes of over-
sensing possibly related to VNS were identified. No blood pressure,
PR, QRS, QT intervals, or standard blood tests changes were
observed. No difference was found throughout the study in the
occurrence of ventricular tachycardia observed at Holter recording.
At the end of the 6-month period, 28 out of 29 patients agreed
to continue treatment with an extended follow-up. During the
subsequent 6-month period, one patient had the opportunity for
heart transplantation and accepted, two patients died, one
stopped stimulation following gastric ulcer, and one stopped

stimulation following implantation of an ICD (patient # 0002).
Thus, 23 patients reached the 12 month visit. Serious AEs observed
during the optional extended follow-up period are listed in Table 3.
Clinical effects
The acute HR changes observed during vagal stimulation were
modest (on the average 1.5 b.p.m. acute difference). However,
baseline resting HR decreased significantly during the study as
shown in Table 4, which also summarizes the most important effi-
cacy variables analysed in the overall population of the study.
Figure 1 shows the NYHA class trajectory of each individual
patient. Most patients improved by at least one NYHA class
both at 3 months (18/32, 56%) and at 6 months (19/32, 59%).
Quality of life, markedly improved at 3 months (from 49+17 to
33+16 MLwHFw Questionnaire), thereafter remaining almost
identical at 6 months (32+ 19). The same was found for the
6-minute walk test with an increase at 3 months from 411+76
to 470+99 month and subsequent stability. The blinded echocar-
diogram analysis disclosed a non-significant decrease in LV end-
diastolic volume, a significant reduction in LV end-systolic
volume, and a significant increase in LVEF (from 22+ 7 to 29+
8%, Figure 2).

Chronic VNS for CHF 851
Data limited to the 21 patients of the second phase of the study
show a behaviour identical to the total cohort, but a non-significant
decrease in LV systolic volume (see Supplementary material online,
Table S1). Comparing baseline with 1-year evaluation in the 23
patients who completed this follow-up revealed maintenance and
even magnification of the favourable effects of vagal stimulation
(especially LVEF from 21 to 34%, Table 5).

Discussion
This open-label study suggests that chronic vagal nerve stimulation
is safe and tolerable in symptomatic congestive HF patients, and
that it leads to a marked clinical subjective improvement. Com-
pared with the previous report suggesting feasibility from a single-
centre experience,15 the present seven-centre international study
on four times more patients provides significant novel data includ-
ing clinical effects over a longer follow-up duration and full disclos-
ure of AEs. Thus, the present study provides the first evidence to
suggest that this new therapeutic approach may produce favour-
able and long-lasting effects on LV function. The preservation of
these effects at 1-year follow-up strongly argues against a major
role of a possible placebo effect.
Background of chronic vagus nerve
stimulation
Several concepts regarding the beneficial role of parasympathetic
activity originate from an animal model for post-infarction
sudden cardiac death2– 4 in which effective vagal reflexes protected
from ventricular fibrillation,4 and baroreflex sensitivity, a marker of
vagal reflexes, was a powerful risk predictor for sudden and non-
sudden cardiac death, a finding2 confirmed in prospective clinical
studies.5,16 In this model, we demonstrated that vagal activation
induced pharmacologically,17 by electrical VNS,3 or by exercise
training,18 exerted a marked beneficial effect.
The hypothesis that VNS may benefit CHF patients was derived
from the combined observations that the prognostic value of
depressed baroreflex sensitivity was present also in CHF7 and
that vagal withdrawal precedes acute decompensation8 and sup-
ported by a growing number of experimental studies.9– 11 In a
murine model of HF, VNS significantly improved LV haemody-
namics and decreased mortality from 50 to 14%.9 In dogs with
microembolization-induced HF, VNS when combined with
chronic beta-blockade improved LV function and caused reverse
remodelling.10 In a pacing-induced HF canine model, dogs were
subjected to 8 weeks of high-rate ventricular pacing with concomi-
tant VNS in the active group and no stimulation in the control
group.11 After 12 weeks, animals in the VNS group had significantly
lower LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and higher LVEF.
This result was obtained in the absence of any HR effect since
both groups were paced.11 Finally, low-intensity VNS not decreas-
ing HR, exerted positive effect on LV function and multiple bio-
markers in the canine microembolization HF model.19
Chronic vagus nerve stimulation in
human
In humans, electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve was
proposed in pioneering works by Schwartz et al.20 and Braunwald
et al.21 for the management of hypertension and angina pectoris,
respectively. However, the technique was soon abandoned,
mainly for technical problems. More recently, VNS has been
used as a therapy for refractory epilepsy.12,13 More than 50 000
patients have been implanted worldwide with an acceptable side-
effect profile.12,13,22 Although VNS for epilepsy is performed on
the left cervical vagus, we stimulated the right vagus, following
the previous animal experience3,9 –11 and because the greater influ-
ence of the right-sided vagus nerve on HR23 would facilitate
correct surgical electrode positioning.
Side-effects and safety
Three patients (including one of the two class IV patients) died
during the study. These mortality events, as well as the episodes
of acute cardiac decompensation were considered predictable by
the investigators considering the severity of HF, and not related
to the investigational device. As happens when performing
studies in chronic patients with advanced diseases, it is difficult
to determine that a clinical condition is certainly not related to
the investigational procedure. Despite this general consideration,
the findings suggest that safety was good without major AEs
clearly related to the device. Although the presence of local side-
effects (e.g. dysphonia) often prevented the attainment of higher
stimulation amplitudes, overall, these AEs were expected on the
basis of the large experience gathered in patients with
epilepsy.12,13,22
Chronic implantation with the CardioFit electrode does not
appear to cause nerve damage. In chronic canine studies, histo-
pathological analysis after 6–9 months showed no difference
between right (implanted) and left (control) vagus nerve in myeli-
nated axon density and nerve function studies showed no differ-
ence in nerve conduction velocity (ML Cohen, and H Sabbah,
manuscript in preparation). Clinically, the HR variability increase
observed in our patients strongly argues against vagus nerve
damage.
Clinical effects
The NYHA class decreased significantly and both quality of life and
exercise capacity improved markedly during the follow-up. The
clinical effects could not be evaluated in the three patients who
died, possibly contributing to the overall positive response of the
remaining 29 subjects. Also, the absence of a control group in
this phase II study, an important limitation shared by all first
studies assessing the effects of medical devices, does not allow
one to exclude the contribution of a placebo effect, a likely contri-
butor to the favourable results observed. However, the changes
observed in the present study were greater than those observed
in the placebo group of studies enrolling similar patients.24 In the

Chronic VNS for CHF 853
MIRACLE ICD trial,24 quality of life improved in the control group
(ICD implantation with resynchronisation therapy off) by 11
points, with 95% confidence intervals 6–16 points. Thus, the
average effect observed in the present study (17 points) exceeds
the 95th percentile of the control group distribution of the
MIRACLE ICD trial and is actually identical to the effect observed
in the active treatment group (17 points, significantly better than
control). Also, we demonstrated persistence of the improvements
after 12 months, whereas the placebo effect is known to progress-
ively decrease over time. These considerations, together with the
favourable effects on HR variability, suggest that a true biological
effect played a major role.
The significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume (by an average
of 17%) and the significant increase in LVEF derived from an off-line
blinded analysis are in good agreement with the experimental find-
ings9 –11 and also argue against a significant placebo effect. These
changes may have clinical implications, since post-hoc analyses from
the response to cardiac resynchronisation therapy indicate that a
10% reduction in LV end-systolic volume is associated with mark-
edly lower long-term mortality and less HF events.25
Mechanisms of action
Vagal stimulation may potentially produce beneficial effects in
patients with HF through several different mechanisms.26,27 In
the present study, the acute change in HR during stimulation was
modest, and the average HR observed during 24-h Holter was
actually unchanged, thus suggesting that HR was not the main
mediator of the apparent favourable effects.
The concept that VNS may have positive direct effects at
ventricular level, independently of its sinus node effects, is in agree-
ment with our earlier findings3 in conscious dogs that the vagally
mediated protection from ventricular fibrillation was, in approxi-
mately half of the cases, completely independent from HR reduction.
Notably, the two most recent experimental studies11,19 found a
beneficial effect of vagal stimulation in the absence of any HR
change. Heart rate-independent effects may include, among
others26,27 anti-adrenergic effects at ventricular level due to
sympathetic–parasympathetic interaction, anti-apoptotic effects,
increase in nitric oxide, reduction in the ischaemia/reperfusion
damage, as well as the so-called anti-inflammatory reflex postulated
by Tracey.28
Conclusions
With the caution necessary in assessing a small size non-controlled
clinical trial, the present findings show that chronic VNS in sympto-
matic CHF patients and LV systolic dysfunction may be safe and
tolerable. This novel therapeutic approach improved quality of life,
decreased LV systolic volume, and increased LVEF at 1-year follow-up.
Vagus nerve stimulation deserves to be tested in a controlled
clinical trial to assess whether it can indeed represent a new non-
pharmacological approach for the treatment of symptomatic HF.
