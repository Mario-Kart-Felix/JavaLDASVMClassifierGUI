ABSTRACT Naive CD4+ T cells produce interleukin 2
(IL-2) but little IL-4 or interferon y (IFN-y). In vitro, they
develop into IL-4 or IFN-y producers depending on the con-
ditions of the priming culture. Using T-cell receptor transgenic
CD4+ T cells, the role of IL-12 and IL-4 in antigen-specific
priming was examined. IL-12 substantially enhanced the abil-
ity of naive CD4+ T cells to develop into cells that produced
LFN-y upon restimulation. However, it was not essential since
anti-IL-12 antibodies failed to block the priming for IFN-y
observed in the absence of exogenous IL-12. When both IL-12
and IL-4 were present in the priming culture, IL-12 did not
inhibit prining for IL-4 production. In contrast, IL-4 dimin-
ished but did not abolish priming for IFN-y production. In an
accessory cell-independent priming system, IL-12 strikingly
augmented priming for IFN-y production, indicating that it
acts directly on T cells. IFN-yitself did not enhance prinming for
EFN-y production in either accessory cell-dependent or inde-
pendent systems. In an accessory cell-dependent system, the
IL-12-mediated enhancement was not blocked by adding neu-
tralizing anti-IFN-'y monoclonal antibody. However, in an
accessory cell-independent system, anti-IFN-y antibody did
inhibit priming for IFN-y production leaving open a role for
IFN-'y in the priming process. These data indicate that IL-12
has a major effect on the inductive phase of T-cell priming by
enhancing commitment to IFN-y production and thus can
profoundly influence the state of immunity that develops.
Naive CD4+ T cells produce interleukin 2 (IL-2) in response
to challenge with antigen and antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
or to polyclonal stimulants such as anti-CD3 antibodies (1, 2).
However, these cells produce little or no IL-4 or interferon
y(IFN- y). Such cells can be primed to become IL-4 or IFN-y
producers. T cells from normal mice stimulated with immo-
bilized anti-CD3 antibody develop into IL-4 producers only
if IL-4 is added to the priming culture (3). Using T cells from
mice transgenic for genes specifying the a and f3 chains of a
T-cell receptor specific for a cytochrome c peptide or for
ovalbumin, it was demonstrated that the addition of IL-4 to
priming cultures resulted in high levels of IL-4 being pro-
duced when the cells were subsequently challenged with
antigen and APCs (4, 5). This priming procedure did not lead
to the appearance of IFN-y-producing cells. By contrast, if
the initial culture was carried out in the absence of IL-4, as
ensured by the presence of a monoclonal anti-IL-4 antibody,
there was virtually no priming for IL-4 production. Rather,
the cells produced IFN-y upon restimulation. These results
were in keeping with in vivo observations in which treatment
with anti-IL-4 antibody at the time of infection with Leish-
mania major or Candida albicans or immunization with

hemocyanin markedly diminished the appearance of antigen-
specific IL-4-producing cells (6-8).
Although these results provide strong evidence that IL-4
plays an important role in the process through which naive
CD4+ T cells develop into cells capable ofproducing IL-4 but
not IFN-y, they leave open the question of the control of
priming for IFN-y production. It is known that peripheral
blood T cells and natural killer (NK) cells from humans will
produce increased amounts of IFN-y if they are cultured in
the presence of IL-12, a recently characterized cytokine (9,
10). T cells from allergic patients grown in the presence of
IL-12 will develop clones producing less IL-4 and more
IFN-y than such cells grown in IL-12-free conditions (11).
Furthermore, T cells from patients positive for purified
protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), if grown in vitro with
PPD and anti-IL-12 antibody, develop into cells with an
increased ability to make IL-4 compared to cells cultured in
the absence ofanti-IL-12 antibody. These results suggest that
IL-12 may be a critical mediator in controlling the expansion
from primed donors of T cells that can produce or develop
into producers of IL4 or IFN-'y. Since these studies exam-
ined the capacity of IL-12 to alter the lymphokine-producing
phenotype of T lymphocytes from donors that have been
primed in vivo, they leave open the question of the extent to
which the regulation of lymphokine-producing phenotype in
such cells resembles the normal process of subset differen-
tiation occurring in naive CD4+ T cells.
Hsieh et al. (12) have recently shown that IL-12 enhances
priming for IFN-yproduction by T cells from mice transgenic
for a T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for ovalbumin. We
wished to determine whether this effect of IL-12 was medi-
ated directly on CD4+ T cells or through an intermediate
stimulation by IFN-y and whether IL-12 was required for
priming for IFN-y production or acted to enhance such
priming. Here we present in vitro data on the influence of
IL-12 on naive CD4+ T cells, which show that IL-12 is not
required for, but strikingly enhances, IFN-y production and
that this effect is directly mediated on T cells. Moreover, we
demonstrate that when both IL-4 and IL-12 are present in the
same culture, IL-12 has little effect on subsequent priming for
IL-4 production compared to IL-4 alone but allows significant
priming for IFN-y production to occur even in the presence
of IL-4.

Cytokines and Antibodies. Human IL-2 was a gift of Cetus.
Mouse recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4) was produced in a baculo-
virus expression system, utilizing a vector into which the
IL-4 gene had been inserted by C. Watson (Laboratory of
Immunology, NIAID). Mouse rIFN-'y was purchased from
Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Mouse rIL-12 was a generous
gift of Genetics Institute and Hoffman-LaRoche (13). Puri-
fied monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-4 antibody (llBll) (14)
was prepared by Verax (Lebanon, NH). Rat anti-mouse
IFN-y antibody (XMG 1.2) (15) was purchased from
PharMingen. Rabbit anti-IL-12 antibody was a generous gift
from Stan Wolf, and the Immunology Department of Genet-
ics Institute. Purified monoclonal hamster anti-mouse CD3
antibody (2C11) (16) was prepared by C. Kinzer (Laboratory
of Immunology, NIAID).
Measurement of Lymphokine Production. IFN-y, IL-4, and
IL-2 were assayed by specific two-site ELISAs (17, 18). The
IL-4-dependent cell line CT.4S (19) was also used to measure
IL-4 production by using serial dilutions of supematant and
comparing responses to those elicited by known amounts of
murine rIL-4. Lymphokine production is reported in units/
ml.
Preparation of T Cells and Accessory Cells. Pooled lymph
node cells were removed from TCR transgenic mice or
BALB/c mice (4-8 wk old) and passed through a nylon wool
column. Cells were then collected and stained with either
phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD4 and fluorescein isothio-
cyanate (FITC) anti-Vail (RR8-1) or PE-labeled anti-CD4
and FITC anti-LECAM-1 (Mel 14) antibodies (20). These
cells were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting
with a FACStar Plus (Becton Dickinson). Post-sort analysis
revealed >99.6% CD4+/Vall+ or CD4+/LECAM-1+ for
TCR transgenic T cells and BALB/c T cells, respectively.
T-cell-depleted spleen cells (TDS) were prepared from B1O.A
mice by removing T cells from splenocytes by treatment with
a mixture of anti-Thyl.2 (HO134; ATCC TIB 99) (21),
anti-CD4 (RL172) (22), and anti-CD8 (3.155) (23) antibodies
plus Low-tox M rabbit complement (Cedarlane Laborato-
ries). Fibroblasts expressing I-Ek as a result of transfection
(DCEK) were a generous gift ofRonald Germain (Laboratory
of Immunology, NIAID).
Primary and Secondary Stimulation of T Cells. Primary
stimulation of transgenic T cells was carried out by adding
3-5 x 105 sorted CD4+/Va,,ll T cells to individual wells of
24-well plates in a total vol of 1 ml with accessory cells,
peptide, and lymphokines. After 36-48 h, cells were trans-
ferred to 5-ml dishes supplemented with fresh medium for an
additional 48 h to allow further expansion. Cultures were
washed three times and 5 x 104T cells were restimulated with
peptide and APCs in a total vol of 200 ul for 36 h. Superna-
tants were collected and assayed for lymphokine. Primary
stimulation of sorted CD4+/LECAM-1+ from BALB/c
mice was carried out by adding 3 x 105 T cells to 5-ml dishes
coated with anti-CD3 antibody (10 ,ug/ml). Various combi-
nations of lymphokines were added. After 4 days, cells were
collected, washed extensively, and restimulated by adding 3
x 104 T cells in 200 ,ul to 96-well plates coated with anti-CD3
antibody in the presence of IL-2 or IL-12. Thirty-six hours
later, supernatants were collected and assayed for lympho-
kine. T cells reexamined by fluorescence-activated cell sort-
ing analysis after the 4-day culture, prior to restimulation,
were found to be >99% CD4+.
RESULTS
IL-12 Enhances the Priming of T Cells to Produce IFN-y
Upon Restimulation. Sorted CD4+ T cells from TCR trans-
genic mice were cultured with DCEK cells, peptide, and
IL-2. We chose to use DCEK as APCs since they express no
detectable mRNA for the p35 or p40 chains of IL-12 (data not
shown). After a 4-day priming culture, the cells were restim-
ulated with fresh DCEK and peptide. In the secondary
culture, 5 x 104 cells produced 115 units ofIFN-yper ml (Fig.
1). Addition of IL-12 to the priming culture resulted in cells
that produced 800 units of IFN-y per ml on secondary
stimulation. In a series of experiments with DCEK or TDS as
APCs, IL-12 was observed to increase priming for IFN-y
production by 1.8- to 25.1-fold with a mean of9.0 ± 3.2 (Table
1). Addition of an anti-IL-12 antiserum neutralized the in-
crease in priming for IFN-y production caused by exogenous
IL-12 (Fig. 1). A control serum failed to alter the IL-12
effects.
Priming for IFN-yCan Occur in the Absence of IL-12 if IL-2
Is Present. To determine whether IL-12 was essential for
priming naive CD4+ T cells for IFN-y production, we tested
the capacity of anti-IL-12 to inhibit the priming for IFN-y
production that is observed in the absence of added IL-12. In
five experiments (Table 1), priming for IFN-yproduction was
observed in the presence of peptide and IL-2. In each case,
as already noted, IL-12 enhanced such priming. Although
anti-IL-12 antibody caused a modest inhibition ofpriming for
IFN-y production in the absence ofexogenous IL-12 in some
experiments, the mean degree of inhibition was by a factor of
0.0 ± 0.21. Thus, T cells could be primed for IFN-y produc-
tion in the absence of IL-12, if IL-2 was present.
IL-12 Can Prime for IFN-y Production in the Presence of
IL-4. IL-4 has been shown to strikingly inhibit priming for
IFN-y production in the absence of exogenous IL-12 (4, 5).
The addition of IL-12 to these cultures allows priming for
IFN-y. As little as 0.1 ng of IL-12 per ml is sufficient for
detectable priming, while optimal priming required 1-10
ng/ml (Fig. 2). Nonetheless, IL-4 still exerts an inhibitory
effect on IL-12-enhanced priming for IFN-y production.
Thus, in four experiments, using 10 ng of IL-12 per ml,
addition of IL-4 to the priming culture reduced subsequent
production of IFN-y by a factor of 0.52 ± 0.04. This should
be contrasted with the almost complete inhibition of priming
for IFN-yproduction exerted by IL-4 in the absence of IL-12.
In those experiments, the mean inhibition was by a factor of
0.95 ± 0.03 (Table 2).
IL-12 Does Not Inhibit Priming for IL-4 Production. The
effect of IL-12 on priming for IL-4 production was studied by
culturing CD4+ T cells with peptide, TDS, IL-2, and IL-4
with or without IL-12. In four experiments, IL-12 did not
have a major effect of priming for IL-4 production (Table 2).

IL-12 Acts Directly on CD4+ T Cells to Increase Priming for
IFN-'y Production. To determine whether IL-12 acts directly
on CD4+ T cells to enhance priming for IFN-y production,
we used a culture system devoid of cells other than CD4+ T
cells. CD4+/LECAM-lhi T cells from BALB/c mice were
purified by cell sorting and cultured on dishes coated with
anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 3). In experiment 1, cells were
primed with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody in the presence
of IL-2 and anti-IL4 antibody with or without IL-12. Cells
primed in the presence of IL-12 produced >300 units of
IFN-y per ml after restimulation; cells primed in the absence
of IL-12 produced amounts of IFN-y that were below the
limits of detection (<5 units/ml). Experiment 2 showed a
similar result. Furthermore, IFN-y had no effect on enhanc-
ing priming for IFN-,y production in the absence of IL-12.

0-10 ng of IL-12 per ml. Supernatants were assessed for IFN-Y
content after stimulation, and results are reported as described in
Fig. 1.
Does IFN-y Play a Role in IL-12-Mediated Enhancement of
Priming for IFN-'y Production? IFN-y has been proposed as
an inducer of priming for IFN-,y production (24-27). We
wished to determine whether neutralizing IFN-y during the
priming culture would affect the capacity of IL-12 to enhance
priming for subsequent IFN-y production. CD4+ TCR trans-
genic T cells were primed with DCEK or TDS, peptide
88-104, IL-2, and exogenous IFN-yor IL-12. In two separate
experiments with DCEK as APCs exogenous IFN-y did not
increase the priming for IFN-'y production, while IL-12
enhanced priming for IFN-y production 3-fold in experiment
1 and 8-fold in experiment 2 (Fig. 4). To further demonstrate
that it was IL-12 and not IFN-'y that was mediating the
increase in priming for IFN- y production, we added IL-12 in
the presence of a neutralizing monoclonal anti-IFN--y anti-
body. Anti-IFN-y failed to diminish the effect of IL-12 in
enhancing priming for IFN-y production. Moreover, several
experiments using TDSs as APCs gave similar results (data
not shown). By contrast, in an accessory cell-independent
system, the ability of IL-12 to enhance production of IFN-y
was substantially diminished in the presence of anti-IFN-,y
antibody (Fig. 4). Thus, this leaves open the possibility that
IFN-,y has a role in enhancing IFN-,y production from naive
T cells.
DISCUSSION
Several recent studies have demonstrated that IL-12 has a
striking effect on increasing production of IFN-y from T
lymphocytes and NK cells (9, 10). We show here, as Hsieh
et al. (12) have recently reported, that IL-12 enhances
priming for IFN-y production. In our experiments, IL-12
caused a 9-fold increase in IFN-y production by purified
CD4+ T cells from TCR transgenic mice in response to
antigen and APCs. On the other hand, priming for IFN-y
production can be achieved in the absence of added IL-12,
even when no endogenous source of IL-12 is present. Thus,
using DCEK cells, which fail to express mRNA for either the
p35 or p40 chains of IL-12, as APCs and purified CD4+ T
cells, priming for IFN-y does occur. Furthermore, in a series
of five experiments, using either DCEK or TDS as APCs,
anti-IL-12 antibody did not significantly inhibit priming for
IFN-y production in the absence of added IL-12. In one of
these experiments, the transgenic T cells had been sorted for
expression ofhigh levels ofLECAM-1, further indicating that
naive CD4+ T cells can be primed to produce IFN-y in the
absence of IL-12. In these experiments, as in priming exper-
iments in which IL-12 was added, IL-2 was essential for
priming for IFN-y production (R.A.S. and W.E.P., unpub-
lished data). Thus, we conclude that IL-12 enhances but is
not required for priming for IFN-y production.
IL-12 can enhance priming for IFN-y production by direct
action on T cells. Its action on T cells was shown in
experiments in which sorted CD4+, LECAM-1+ T cells from
BALB/c mice were cultured with immobilized anti-CD3
antibody and IL-2. In this system, IL-12 strikingly increased
priming for IFN-y production. Since the only cells in this
system are CD4+ T cells and those cells used have been
selected for expression of a marker (LECAM-1) associated
with a naive phenotype (28), these experiments provide a
clear demonstration that the IL-12 effect in priming can be
mediated directly on resting T cells.
Others have suggested that IFN-y itself may act to induce
or enhance priming for IFN-y production in vitro from naive
T cells (24-27). Although we could find no evidence of this
in our previous studies carried out by priming with peptide,
APCs, and IL-2 (4), we directly tested whether IFN-y might
be required for the enhanced priming mediated by IL-12.
Similar to a recent report by Macatonia et al. (27), the
presence of exogenous IFN-y did not enhance subsequent

For IFN-y production, sorted CD4+ transgenic T cells (5 x 105) were primed by stimulation for 4 days with TDS (1.5 x 105), peptide (1 PM),
IL-2 (10 units/ml), IL-4, or anti-IL-4 antibody in the presence or absence of exogenous IL-12. Inhibition of IFN-y production in the presence
or absence of IL-12 was calculated by dividing the amount of IFN-y produced when IL-4 was present in the primary culture by that produced
in the presence of anti-IL-4 antibody. To evaluate priming for IL-4 production, sorted CD4+ transgenic T cells (5 x 105) were primed by

IFN--y production. Moreover, we observed that anti-IFN-y
antibody did not substantially diminish the enhanced priming
for IFN-y production caused by addition of IL-12 in acces-
sory cell-dependent priming. However, in accessory cell-
independent priming, the addition of anti-IFN-y antibody to
cultures substantially diminished the IL-12-mediated in-
crease in production of IFN-y. The fact that IFN-y does not
replace the action of IL-12 rules out the possibility that the
sole function ofIL-12 is to induce IFN-y, with the latter being
the actual priming stimulant for IFN--producing cells. Our
failure to block priming for IFN-y production in the acces-
sory cell-dependent system but not in the accessory cell-
independent system suggests that the requirements for prim-
ing in the two systems may be different. Indeed, IFN-y may
act as cofactor with IL-12 providing a stimulant that can also
be mediated by APCs in the accessory cell-dependent prim-
ing system. However, the possibility that we failed to com-
pletely neutralize all the IFN-y in the accessory cell-
dependent system cannot be unequivocally excluded. This
would be a tenable explanation only if very small amounts of
IFN- y were required to mediate its inducing effect since little
or no IFN-'y is detected early in the priming culture. Fur-
thermore, the amounts of anti-IFN-y antibody added to the
priming cultures should be sufficient to neutralize virtually all
such IFN-y. Thus, if IFN-y is essential, a small nonneutral-
ized residuum would have to mediate this effect. IFN-y does
appear to have a substantial effect in priming for IFN-y

production in vivo. In infection with Leishmania, Scott (25)
and Chatelain et al. (26) have demonstrated that anti-IFN-y
antibody treatment diminished subsequent production of
IFN-y as measured in vitro from whole lymph nodes. The
mechanism through which anti-IFN-y antibody treatment
suppresses priming for IFN-y production may be indirect
(i.e., by enhancing IL-4 production) or it may be due to a
direct action of IFN-y on T cells that is not reflected in the
in vitro priming system.
In physiologic situations, it seems likely that priming will
often occur in the presence of mixtures of IL-4 and IL-12. To
gain insight into the effects of these two agents in one
anothers' presence, we carried out priming experiments

FIG. 3. IL-12 has a direct effect on T cells to increase priming for
IFN-yproduction. Sorted CD4+/LECAM-1+ T cells (3 x 105) from
naive BALB/c mice were stimulated for 4 days with immobilized
anti-CD3, IL-2, and anti-IL-4 antibodies (10 pg/ml) in the presence
of IFN-y or IL-12. Cells were washed three times, and 3 x 104 cells
per 200 ,1 were restimulated for 36 h in 96-well plates coated with
anti-CD3 antibody in the presence of IL-2. Supernatants were
assessed for IFN-y content, and results are reported as described in
Fig. 1.

FIG. 4. Role of IFN-y in the IL-12-mediated enhancement of
priming for IFN-y production. Experiments 1 and 2: sorted CD4+
transgenic T cells (5 x 105) were primed by stimulation for 4 days
with DCEK cells (1.5 x 105), peptide (1 pM), and IL-2 (10 units/ml)
in the presence of IFN-y(500 units/ml), IL-12 (10 ng/ml), IL-12 and
IFN-y, or IL-12 and anti-IFN-y antibody (10 pg/ml). Experiment 3:
sorted CD4+/LECAM-1+ T cells (3 x 105) from naive BALB/c
mice were stimulated for 4 days with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody,
IL-2, and either IFN-y (2000 units/ml), or IL-12 (10 pg/ml) in the
presence or absence of anti-IFN--y antibody (10 pg/ml). Two sepa-
rate preparations of anti-IFN-y antibody were used. Cells were
washed three times, and 3 x 104 cells per 200 y4 were restimulated
for 36 h in 96-well plates coated with anti-CD3 antibody in the
presence ofIL-2. Supernatants were assayed for IFN-'ycontent after
restimulation, and results are reported as described in Fig. 1.

using both IL-4 and IL-12. We and others have previously
demonstrated that IL-4 is essential for the in vitro develop-
ment of naive CD4+ T cells into IL-4 producers (3-5, 29) and,
when present at concentrations of 1000 units/ml (0.4 x
10-10 M), is strikingly inhibitory for priming for IFN-'y
production. When suboptimal amounts of IL-4 were used
(100 units/ml) in the priming culture, inhibition for priming
for IFN-y production was only partial. Here we show that
even in the presence of optimal concentrations of IL-4, IL-12
allows priming for IFN-y production. Indeed, as little as 0.1
ng of IL-12 per ml is sufficient to obtain measurable priming
for IFN-y production. Nonetheless, IL-4 does have cross-
regulatory activity even in the presence of optimal amounts
of IL-12; it caused inhibition of such priming by a factor of
0.52 ± 0.04. However, this should be contrasted with its
virtual complete inhibition ofpriming for IFN- yproduction in
the absence of IL-12.
By contrast, IL-12 has little effect on priming for IL-4
production. Thus, if sufficient IL-4 is present to prime for
IL-4 production, even in the presence of IL-12 such priming
will occur. We have previously shown that when suboptimal
concentrations of IL-4 are used (100 units/ml; 0.4 x 10-11
M), IFN-y diminished the amount of IL-4 produced upon
restimulation, suggesting a possible cross-regulatory role for
IFN-y and, thus, an indirect cross-regulatory role for IL-12.
This is consistent with reports showing that IFN-y diminishes
the appearance of IL-4-producing cells in mice infected with
L. major. Moreover, during the derivation of T-cell clones,
IFN-'y was inhibitory for the appearance of IL-4-producing
T-cell clones (30).
Our in vitro studies and those of others suggest that in vivo
establishment of a lymphokine-producing phenotype may be
quite complex. Thus, we and Hsieh et al. (12) have shown
that although IL-12 does not inhibit priming for IL-4 produc-
tion in vitro, through its induction of IFN-'y, it might serve to
diminish the appearance of IL-4-producing cells if suboptimal
amounts of IL-4 were present in vivo at the time of priming.
In recent reports, IL-4 production in mice infected with L.
major was significantly decreased after injection of IL-12 (31,
32). Heinzel et al. (31) showed that infected mice coinjected
with IL-12 and anti-IFN-y antibody showed no decrease in
IL-4 production compared to infected controls, suggesting
that IFN-y was critical in downregulating IL-4 production in
vivo. Similarly, Morris et al. (33) have shown that IL-12
enhances IFN-y production and diminishes IL-4 production
in response to a primary infection with Nippostrongylus
brasiliensis. A similar reversal of phenotype has been ob-
served in the response to injected schistosome eggs (I.
Oswald and A. S., unpublished data). Moreover, anti-IFN-y
antibody completely blocked the inhibitory effect of IL-12 on
priming for IL-4 production in response to Leishmania (31)
but did not diminish priming for IFN-y. These in vivo
experiments all point to IL-12 having a direct role in priming
for IFN-y production and an indirect cross-regulatory effect
on IL-4 production through the production of IFN-y.
These results indicate that the cytokines present at the
outset of a response powerfully determine the character of
the response that ensues and suggest that optimal vaccine
strategies for protection against intracellular organisms might
include both administration of IL-12 and neutralization of
IL4. A major question that remains open is whether estab-
lished Thl or Th2 phenotypes can be altered by manipula-
tions of the cytokine environment.
