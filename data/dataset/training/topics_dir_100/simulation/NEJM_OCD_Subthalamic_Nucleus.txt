Background
Severe, refractory obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition. Stimu-
lation of the subthalamic nucleus, a procedure that is already validated for the treat-
ment of movement disorders, has been proposed as a therapeutic option.
Methods
In this 10-month, crossover, double-blind, multicenter study assessing the efficacy 
and safety of stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, we randomly assigned eight pa-
tients with highly refractory OCD to undergo active stimulation of the subthalamic 
nucleus followed by sham stimulation and eight to undergo sham stimulation fol-
lowed by active stimulation. The primary outcome measure was the severity of OCD, 
as assessed by the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), at the end of 
two 3-month periods. General psychopathologic findings, functioning, and toler-
ance were assessed with the use of standardized psychiatric scales, the Global As-
sessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, and neuropsychological tests.
Results
After active stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, the Y-BOCS score (on a scale 
from 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating less severe symptoms) was significantly 
lower than the score after sham stimulation (mean [±SD], 19±8 vs. 28±7; P = 0.01), and 
the GAF score (on a scale from 1 to 90, with higher scores indicating higher levels 
of functioning) was significantly higher (56±14 vs. 43±8, P = 0.005). The ratings of 
neuropsychological measures, depression, and anxiety were not modified by stimu-
lation. There were 15 serious adverse events overall, including 1 intracerebral hem-
orrhage and 2 infections; there were also 23 nonserious adverse events.
Conclusions
These preliminary findings suggest that stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may 
reduce the symptoms of severe forms of OCD but is associated with a substantial 
risk of serious adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00169377.)

Severe obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive, anxious thoughts and repetitive, ritualized behaviors. 
It is one of the most disabling of the chronic psy-
chiatric disorders and has considerable repercus-
sions on family relationships, social life, and the 
ability to function at work.1 The current treatment 
of OCD consists of a combination of serotonin-
reuptake inhibitors and cognitive–behavioral ther-
apy; with this treatment, however, 25 to 40% of 
patients have persistent symptoms and lasting 
functional repercussions.2 In the hope of reducing 
the disability and debilitation of patients whose 
OCD is highly refractory, ablative neurosurgical 
stereotactic treatments have been attempted, but 
the efficacy of these treatments has been variable.3 
In contrast, deep-brain stimulation, which has 
been proved effective in the treatment of move-
ment disorders, is a therapeutic alternative that is 
adaptable and reversible, permitting the modula-
tion of the dysfunctional neural networks4 that are 
involved in the pathophysiology of OCD.3,5 Differ-
ent parts of the orbito–fronto–striato–thalamo–
cortical circuit, including the ventral striatum, in-
ternal capsule, and nucleus accumbens, have been 
targeted for stimulation, as described in several 
case reports6-11 and in a report on a prospective 
open-label study12; the long-term results have been 
variable but promising. Furthermore, studies of 
stimulation in patients with Parkinson’s disease 
have highlighted the putative role of the subtha-
lamic nucleus in behavioral integration13 and the 
efficacy of subthalamic nucleus stimulation in re-
ducing repetitive behaviors,14 anxiety,15 obsessive–
compulsive symptoms,16 and OCD.17,18 These re-
sults, combined with the long-term effects of 
stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus19 and the 
ability to target small, well-defined structures20 
with the use of validated procedures,21,22 led us to 
propose the subthalamic nucleus as a target for 
the treatment of highly resistant OCD. Here we re-
port on a randomized, double-blind, crossover 
study comparing stimulation of the subthalam-
ic nucleus with sham stimulation. The change 
in symptoms of OCD was the primary outcome 
measure.
Me thods
Patients
We enrolled patients with refractory OCD in the 
study. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they 
were between 18 and 60 years of age and had re-
ceived a primary diagnosis of OCD, defined accord-
ing to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), 
and established with the use of the Diagnostic In-
terview for Genetic Studies,23 with a disease dura-
tion of more than 5 years, a score on the Yale–Brown 
Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)24 of more 
than 25 (on a scale from 0 to 40, with lower scores 
indicating less severe symptoms) or one subscale 
score of more than 15 (on a scale of 0 to 20); a score 
on the Global Assessment Functioning (GAF)25 
scale of less than 40 (on a scale from 1 to 90, with 
higher scores indicating higher levels of function-
ing); and a score for severity of illness on the Clin-
ical Global Impression (CGI) scale of more than 
4 (on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicat-
ing greater severity of the disease).26 
Additional inclusion criteria were a lack of re-
sponse to drug therapy after adequate adminis-
tration (defined as more than 12 weeks at the 
maximum tolerated dose) of at least three sero-
tonin-reuptake inhibitors, one of which had to be 
clomipramine, with augmentation over a period 
of at least 1 month with risperidone or pimozide 
and one of the following: lithium, clonazepam, 
buspirone, or pindolol2; lack of response to cogni-
tive–behavioral therapy (exposure and response-
prevention technique) over the course of 1 year of 
therapy or after 20 sessions with at least two 
therapists; normal cognitive status (a score of >130 
on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, which 
ranges from 0 to 144, with lower scores indicat-
ing more severe dementia)27; normal findings on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain; 
and no contraindications to surgery or anesthesia. 
Exclusion criteria were schizophrenic disorder; 
bipolar disorder; substance abuse or dependence 
(except for dependence on nicotine), as assessed 
with the use of the Mini-International Neuropsy-
chiatric Interview (MINI 5.0.0)28; cluster A or B 
personality disorder according to DSM-IV criteria, 
as assessed with the use of the Structured Clini-
cal Interview II29; a current severe major depressive 
episode, determined according to DSM-IV criteria 
(as assessed with the use of the MINI 5.0.0) and 
defined by a Montgomery and Åsberg Depression 
Scale (MADRS)30 score of more than 20 (on a scale 
from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater 
severity of depressive symptoms) (a depressive epi-
sode with a MADRS score of <20 or a MADRS 
score of ≥20 without depressive-episode criteria

was not a criterion for exclusion); and a risk of 
suicide (a score of >2 on MADRS item 10). 
For each patient, unstructured interviews were 
conducted by three psychiatrists to establish the 
appropriateness of neurosurgery. The reports on 
these evaluations and interviews were reviewed by 
an independent selection committee of three ex-
pert psychiatrists, who made the final decisions 
with respect to eligibility.
Study Design
The study had a randomized, double-blind, cross-
over design with two 3-month phases separated 
by a 1-month washout period (Fig. 1). The trial was 
conducted at 10 academic centers in France in ac-
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was 
approved by the ethics committee of the Pitié-
Salpêtrière University Hospital. All patients pro-
vided written informed consent. Eligible patients 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two 
groups: one group underwent active stimulation 
followed by a sham-stimulation period (the on–off 
group) and the other underwent sham stimulation 
followed by an active-stimulation period (the off–
on group). We used a blocking-scheme and a cen-
tralized procedure for randomization, without 
stratification. A clinical examination was per-
formed at each visit by a psychiatrist and a neurolo-
gist who were unaware of the stimulation status. 
Any new symptom or worsening of a preexisting 
symptom was classified as an adverse event. An 
adverse event was classified as serious if the pa-
tient required hospitalization, if sequelae were 
present, or if the clinician considered the event to 
be serious.
Surgery and Stimulation
The subthalamic nucleus was preoperatively tar-
geted by means of stereotactic MRI21 and, depend-
ing on the local surgical protocol, by means of 
ventriculography, with additional targeting per-
formed by the coordinating center20,31 (Fig. 2). The 
target in our patients with OCD was 2 mm ante-
rior to and 1 mm medial to the target that is used 
in patients with Parkinson’s disease,32 at the bound-
ary of the associative and limbic territories of the 
subthalamic nucleus (Fig. 2).20,33 Intraoperative mi-
crorecordings were performed along three to five 
trajectories (central, anterior, posterior, medial, and 
lateral) with the use of standardized procedures34 
by the electrophysiology teams from both the lo-
cal and the coordinating centers. Intraoperative 
macrostimulation was performed along the same 
trajectories to evaluate the immediate effects.35 The 
four-contact definitive electrode (model 3389 DBS, 
Medtronic) was implanted along the trajectory with 
the best ratio of beneficial to adverse effects.35 The 
position of the electrode was confirmed by atlas-
based neuroimaging13,20,22 before the implanta-
tion of the pulse generator (Soletra or Kinetra, 
Medtronic).
Each contact was tested separately 2 months 
after surgery (Fig. 1). Stimulation frequency and 
pulse duration were 130 Hz and 60 μsec, respec-
tively, with the voltage adjusted to the individual 
patient. Side effects were investigated by testing 
each contact with a progressive voltage increase up 
to 4 V. The therapeutic contact was selected ac-
cording to the best immediate clinical effect or, 
if there was no immediate improvement, accord-
ing to the intraoperative data and the anatomical 
localization of each contact as determined postop-
eratively with the digital atlas.20 In the absence of 
side effects, the most ventral contact within the 
subthalamic nucleus was selected. The voltage for 
the randomization period was set below the side-
effect threshold, and as close as possible to the 
usual stimulation settings that are used in pa-
tients with Parkinson’s disease.19 It was recom-
mended that the patient’s medical treatment re-
main stable. Treatment adjustments necessitated 
by the patient’s psychiatric condition were care-
fully recorded.
Statistical Analysis
The power calculation was based on our estimate 
that at baseline, the patients’ mean Y-BOCS score 
would be 26, with a standard deviation of 4.65 for 
the difference between the on-stimulation and off-
stimulation periods. The study was designed to 
have an overall power of 80% to detect a 50% re-
duction in the primary end point (the Y-BOCS score) 
during the on-stimulation period (a benefit amount-
ing to a 13-point reduction in the score) and a 10% 
reduction during the off-stimulation period (a pla-
cebo effect amounting to a 2.6-point reduction) as 
calculated with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test, with six patients per group (two-tailed, type I 
error rate of 5%). Because of an unexpected increase 
in the number of eligible patients in most centers 
and in order to increase the power for secondary 
end points, the total number of enrolled patients 
was increased to 18. All analyses included all ran-
domly assigned patients.

The primary outcome was the change in the 
Y-BOCS score at the end of each period. Analyses 
of the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes 
were performed by testing three effects: carryover 
(some effects, physical or psychological, of the first 
treatment are still present when the patient enters 
the second treatment period), period (the effect of 
stimulation was different in the on–off group than 
in the off–on group), and treatment effects.36 All 
reported P values are two-tailed. A type I error rate 
of 5% was used except for the analysis of the 
carryover effect, in which it was fixed at 10%.36 No 
interim analysis was performed. 
For the treatment effect on secondary out-
comes, a Bonferroni correction was applied accord-
ing to the disciplinary fields, which included two 
subscores of the Y-BOCS, two measures of global 
health and functioning (GAF25 and CGI26), a self-
reported measure of functional impairment (Shee-
han Disability Scale),37 two measures of major 
psychiatric symptoms (MADRS30 and Brief Scale 
for Anxiety38), and seven neuropsychological mea-
sures assessing fronto–subcortical functions (at-
tention, executive functions, verbal learning, and 
decision making).39-44 The definitions of a re-
sponse with respect to Y-BOCS and GAF scores 
— which were not prespecified in the protocol — 
were a 25% decrease and increase, respectively, at 
the end of the first phase (6 months after sur-
gery [Fig. 1]).2 An additional response criterion 
was defined by a GAF score that was higher than 
51, which corresponds to “moderate symptoms 
or moderate difficulty in social or occupational 
functioning.”
R esult s
Study Population
A total of 18 patients were enrolled between Jan-
uary 2005 and April 2006. One patient withdrew 
from the study before the procedure, and stimula-
tors were implanted in the remaining 17 patients. 
The stimulator and the two electrodes were re-
moved from 1 patient (Patient 9) before random-
ization because of an infection; thus, 16 patients 
completed the randomization period (Table 1). 
At the time of the patients’ inclusion in the study, 
the mean duration of disease was 18 years (range, 
6 to 47); two patients fulfilled the criteria for cur-
rent major depressive disorder but had a MADRS 
score that was lower than 20 (Table 1). One patient 
who abused alcohol, which represented a minor 
deviation from the protocol, was included because 
the abuse was revealed between the time of in-
clusion and surgery and was moderate and limited 
in time. There was no significant difference in 
baseline (month 3) clinical characteristics between 
the patients in the two groups (Table 2). Table 1 
lists the medications the patients were taking at 
the time of inclusion. Two patients (Patients 5 and 
7) were taking no medication at baseline at their 
request. Medication was held constant during the 
10 months of the protocol except for a transient in-
crease in benzodiazepine therapy in three patients

The study included two 3-month treatment phases (month 3 to month 6 and month 7 to month 10) separated by a 
1-month washout period. Patients were evaluated at inclusion, less than 2 months before surgery; 3 months after 
surgery, before active or sham stimulation; 6 months after surgery, at the end of the first randomization period;  
7 months after surgery, at the end of the 1-month washout period; and 10 months after surgery, at the end of the

patients completed both periods of the study.
Efficacy of the Stimulation
The Y-BOCS score was significantly lower at the 
end of the active stimulation (on-stimulation pe-
riod) than at the end of the sham stimulation (off-
stimulation period) (mean score, 19±8 vs. 28±7; 
P = 0.01), independently of the group and the pe-
riod. We did not detect any significant carryover 
effect in Y-BOCS scores (P = 0.71), indicating that 
the effects of the first treatment period did not 
persist after the washout period. Patients who were 
assigned to have active stimulation first and sham 
stimulation second (the on–off group) tended to 
have a larger treatment effect as measured by the

Figure 2. Atlas-Based Targeting on Preoperative MRI and Localization of the Electrodes and Contacts  
on Postoperative MRI in Patient 1.
Panel A shows the preoperative atlas-based MRI alignment, performed with the use of a three-dimensional histologic 
atlas of the basal ganglia, adapted to fit the patient’s brain geometry. The tracings of the putamen (pu) and thalamus 
(th) are well aligned with the corresponding structures in the axial plane. Panel B shows localization of the target in 
the anteromedial subthalamic nucleus (stn) near the boundary between the associative (violet) and limbic (yellow) 
territories. The exact target is at the intersection of the two red lines. The sensorimotor territory is green. The other 
atlas structures include the caudate nucleus (cd), cerebral peduncle (cp), optic tract (ot), red nucleus (rn), putamen 
(pu), and zona incerta (zi). Panel C shows a three-dimensional, superior view of the subthalamic nucleus after fusion 
with the three-dimensional MRI acquisition, an axial plane of which is shown. The two electrodes enter the associa-
tive territory of the nucleus (violet). The sensorimotor territory is green. The limbic territory (yellow), which occu-
pies a small portion of the most anterior part of the nucleus, is small in this superior view. Panel D shows oblique 
views of each subthalamic nucleus, presented along the long axis of each electrode with transparent rendering of 
the three territories (associative, violet; sensorimotor, green; and limbic, yellow). The active contacts (yellow) are in 
the anteromedial (probable associative–limbic) part of the subthalamic nucleus. The nonactive contacts are in blue.

Subthalamic Nucleus Stimulation in Severe OCD

tion first and active stimulation second (the off–
on group) (P=0.06 for the period effect). The GAF 
score (in which higher scores indicate higher lev-
els of functioning) was significantly higher after 
active stimulation than after sham stimulation 
(mean score at the end of active stimulation, 56±14 
vs. 43±8; P = 0.005). The CGI score (in which lower 
scores indicate lesser severity of disease) was sig-
nificantly lower at the end of active stimulation 
than at the end of sham stimulation (P = 0.008), 
with more improvement during active stimulation 
observed in the on–off group than in the off–on 
group (P = 0.03 for the period effect). Scores on 
MADRS, the Brief Scale for Anxiety, neuropsycho-
logical ratings, and the Sheehan Disability Scale at 
the end of active stimulation did not differ signifi-
cantly from the scores at the end of sham stimu-
lation. At the end of the first phase (i.e., 3 months 
after randomization), six of eight patients (75%) 
had a response as measured by the Y-BOCS score 
and eight of eight (100%) had a response as mea-
sured by the GAF after active stimulation, as com-
pared with three of eight (38%) as measured by 
both Y-BOCS and GAF after sham stimulation (Fig. 
3B). In addition, five of eight patients (62%) had 
an increase in the GAF score to 51 after active stim-
ulation as compared with one of eight (12%) after 
sham stimulation (Fig. 3B).
Electrode Localization and Stimulation 
Settings
For 27 of 34 implanted electrodes (79%), the elec-
trode trajectory that was chosen was the central 
one. The anterior trajectory was chosen for 4 elec-
trodes, the posterior for 2, and the internal for 1. 
Of the 32 electrodes that were implanted in the 16 
patients who completed the study, 4 electrodes, 
in 4 different patients, were not localized within 
the subthalamic nucleus — 3 were medial to the 
subthalamic nucleus in zona incerta and field 
H2 of Forel, and 1 was lateral to the subthalamic 
nucleus in the internal capsule. However, each pa-
tient had at least one contact within the subtha-
lamic nucleus. Postrandomization anatomical 
analysis showed that among the 33 contacts se-
lected as therapeutic, stimulation reached the 
anteromedial part of the subthalamic nucleus in 
24 (Fig. 2), the zona incerta in 4, the internal cap-
sule in 4, the substantia nigra in 3, and field H2 of 
Forel in 2 (contacts located at the boundary of two 
regions were counted twice). In two patients, stim-
ulation was applied unilaterally; in one patient 
(Patient 8), adverse effects were noted on all con-
tacts from one electrode during the tests 2 months 
after surgery, and in the other patient (Patient 4), 
one Soletra stimulator was disconnected owing to 
infection. Current was delivered through one con-
tact for 27 of 30 electrodes, and two contiguous 
contacts were used in 3 electrodes (bipolar stimu-
lation). The mean (±SD) voltage was 2.0±0.8 V.
Adverse Events
Fifteen serious adverse events, of which four were 
related to surgery, were reported in 11 patients 
(Table 3). The most serious event was a parenchy-
mal brain hemorrhage resulting in a permanent 
finger palsy in one patient. Seven transient motor 
and psychiatric symptoms induced by active stim-
ulation occurred in the first month of stimulation 
and resolved spontaneously or rapidly after adjust-
ment of the setting. Four serious adverse events 
that were unrelated to either surgery or stimula-
tion were reported in one patient before surgery 
and in two patients during the washout and sham-
stimulation phases. Twenty-three nonserious ad-
verse events were reported in 10 patients (Table 3). 
During the active-stimulation period, seven behav-
ioral adverse events were reported in five patients.
Discussion
In this double-blind, crossover trial, stimulation 
of the subthalamic nucleus reduced symptoms in 
patients with severe, highly refractory, primary 
OCD, with no concomitant neuropsychological del-
eterious effects. Moreover, the reversibility of the 
stimulation was demonstrated by the fact that 
symptoms of OCD tended to return to baseline in 
patients who underwent stimulation in the first 
period. There was no significant effect of the stim-
ulation on measures of depression or anxiety, neu-
ropsychological measures, or self-assessment of 
disability. There were 15 serious adverse events, 
of which 4 were related to the surgical procedure, 
including 1 intracerebral hemorrhage and 2 infec-
tions requiring removal of the electrode, and 7 were 
related to the stimulation and were transient. 
Therefore, the benefits of this surgical treatment 
for symptoms of OCD should be carefully weighed 
against the potential occurrence of such serious 
adverse events.
The improvement in scores observed in the 
prerandomization postoperative period (months 
0 to 3) and the trend toward an effect of the order

of the study treatments (in favor of the patients 
who underwent active stimulation during the first 
period) could reflect nonspecific therapeutic or 
placebo effects attributable to the positive effect 
of enrollment and surgery. However, the crossover, 
double-blind design of the study and the improve-
ment in patients who underwent active stimula-
tion during the second period (the off–on group) 
do not support this hypothesis. It is unlikely that 
the decrease in obsessive–compulsive symptoms 
reflected an antidepressant effect,11,12 since no 
mood changes were reported during the study. 
Finally, the placement of the electrode in the sub-
thalamic nucleus was meticulously determined 
and verified with the use of a precise, well-con-
trolled procedure,13,20 and the intensity of the 
stimulation was sufficiently limited to confine the 
current to the targeted part of the structure.13 
This study confirms our previous finding that 
obsessive–compulsive symptoms are reduced af-

Order ing,43 Digit Symbol Coding,44 and Lexical Fluency). All carryover and period effects were not significant except for 
the period effect for the CGI scale (P = 0.03). BAS denotes Brief Scale for Anxiety, CGI Clinical Global Impression, GAF 
Global Assessment of Functioning, MADRS Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Scale, SDS Sheehan Disabilities

† P values are for the between-group comparison of the difference between active and sham stimulation at the end of 
each period (month 6 and month 10).
‡ The range for each subscale of the SDS is 1 to 10; higher numbers indicate greater disability.
§ Test B–A refers to the score on Trail Making Test B minus the score on Trail Making Test A.
¶ Higher positive values on the Stroop interference index indicate greater difficulty in blocking interference.

therefore propose that the decrease in obsessive–
compulsive symptoms is due to changes in neu-
ronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus, a theory 
that is consistent with the concept that the sub-
thalamic nucleus is an integrative center for the 
motor, cognitive, and emotional components of 
behavior.13 Moreover, considering that patients 
with OCD are engaged in repetitive thoughts that 
result in the deferral of decision making and ac-
tion, we propose that stimulation of the subtha-
lamic nucleus may modify the maintenance of a 
decision-deferring process, as shown in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease,45 and therefore decrease 
obsessive–compulsive symptoms.
Previous studies of stimulation in patients with 
OCD have consisted of uncontrolled, open-label 
designs3; therefore, a comparison of the findings 
of those studies with the results of our study is 
difficult. Two blinded procedures in four patients 
involved the anterior limb of the internal capsule 
and produced limited benefit with high voltages.7,9 
In an open collaborative study involving 10 pa-
tients whose preoperative clinical characteristics 
were similar to those of the patients in our study, 
Y-BOCS scores were reduced by more than 25% in 
50% of the patients after 3 months of stimulation 
of the ventral striatum12; in contrast, 75% of the 
patients in our study had reduced Y-BOCS scores. 
After 36 months of unblinded stimulation that 
allowed optimal management of the settings in 
eight patients, the asymptotic best values for the 
OCD-severity and global-functioning scores12 
showed less improvement than the scores in our 
study after 3 months of double-blind stimulation. 
In all previous studies,6-12 electrical-stimulation 
settings were more variable and higher than those

Figure 3. Changes in the Severity of OCD and Global Functioning in 16 Patients during the Crossover Study  
of Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus.
Panel A shows the mean (±SD) scores on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and the Global As-
sessment of Functioning (GAF) scale for the on–off group and the off–on group. Data are shown at the time of in-
clusion in the study (I), at the time of surgery (month 0), before (month 3) and after (month 6) the first period of 
active or sham stimulation, and before (month 7) and after (month 10) the second period of active or sham stimu-
lation. Panel B shows the individual Y-BOCS and GAF scores for the on–off group and the off–on group. The active-
stimulation period is represented in gray. One patient in each group (Patient 6 in the on–off group and Patient 2 in 
the off–on group) had higher Y-BOCS scores and one patient in the off–on group (Patient 2) had a lower GAF score 
during active stimulation (dashed lines).

settings suggests that they were induced by stimu-
lation of the subthalamic nucleus and highlights 
the necessity of multidisciplinary expertise in the 
medical care of patients undergoing stimulation of 
the subthalamic nucleus. The study did not show 
an effect on functional impairment at work as 
measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale. Fifteen 
of 16 patients had not worked for many years, and 
given the short (3-month) crossover trial period, 
we did not expect patients to return to work at the 
end of the protocol. Finally, interesting short-term 
and long-term therapeutic results have been shown 
in studies of the use of cingulotomy or capsulot-
omy in patients with refractory OCD,3,47 with vari-
able surgical risks and adverse events; however, 
given the methodologic heterogeneity of all these 
procedures, a direct comparison would be neces-
sary to assess precisely the advantages and limi-
tations of each strategy.
The multicenter design of this study has poten-
tial limitations. Variation in the targeting of the 
stimulation was minimized by anatomical and 
electrophysiological identification performed si-
multaneously by local and coordinating teams. In 
addition, patients who had unexpected responses 
were examined thoroughly at the detailed clinical 
follow-up examination that was required by the 
study protocol. For example, two patients had a 
higher Y-BOCS score after active stimulation (Fig. 
3). In one of these patients (Patient 6), the level of 
anxiety increased when a palsy of his right hand, 
the hand with which he had engaged in compul-
sive activities preoperatively, developed as a result 
of a parenchymal brain hemorrhage after surgery. 
In the other patient (Patient 2), because low-inten-
sity stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in-
duced side effects, the intensity chosen for the ac-
tive-stimulation period (month 7) may have been 
too low to reduce the symptoms of OCD. More-
over, adjustment of the settings was purposely 
limited in this study to be under the threshold for 
the induction of side effects in order to preserve 
the blinded nature of the protocol. Thus, the 
stimulation settings are a further possible limita-
tion of the study. Continued follow-up of patients 
undergoing stimulation of the subthalamic nucle-
us is needed to assess any long-term effects of 
stimulation that have not yet been identified.
In conclusion, findings from this 3-month 
crossover study suggest that stimulation of the 
subthalamic nucleus may lessen the severity of 
obsessive–compulsive symptoms and improve glo-
bal functioning in patients with refractory, severe 
OCD. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 of the 
17 patients in whom stimulators were implanted. 
The occurrence of severe adverse events, the small 
number of patients, and the short duration of the 
study highlight the risks of stimulation of the sub-
thalamic nucleus and the need for larger studies 
with longer follow-up. In addition to assessment in 
a larger number of patients, a comparison with 
other stimulation targets and surgical procedures 
would be desirable, as would an evaluation of the 
long-term benefits of stimulation of the subtha-
lamic nucleus in patients with OCD, notably with 
respect to their quality of life and their ability to 
function in social and work environments.

clinical trial registration
The Journal requires investigators to register their clinical trials  
in a public trials registry. The members of the International Committee  
of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) will consider most clinical trials for publication 
only if they have been registered (see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1).  
Current information on requirements and appropriate registries  
is available at www.icmje.org/faq.pdf.
