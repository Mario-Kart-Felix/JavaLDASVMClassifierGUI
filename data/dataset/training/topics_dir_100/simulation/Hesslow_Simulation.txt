It might be said that cognitive science rests upon the
assumption that human behaviour cannot be
understood by taking only perceptual and motor
processes into account and that distinct cognitive
mechanisms are required to explain behaviour. Yet,
developments in several fields during the last couple
of decades suggest that cognitive and sensorimotor
mechanisms are intimately connected. Among these
are emerging ideas about embodied cognition [1,2]
and findings that imagery relies heavily on sensory
mechanisms and that certain kinds of problem
solving involves motor structures.
The view to be defended here, is that this
somewhat paradoxical situation can be resolved by
what we might call the ‘simulation hypothesis’,
essentially a combination of some ideas originally
formulated by British empiricist philosophers in the
18th century [3] and their associationist
descendants [4]. This hypothesis states that thinking
consists of simulated interaction with the environment,
and rests on the following three core assumptions:
(1) Simulation of actions: we can activate motor
structures of the brain in a way that resembles
activity during a normal action but does not cause
any overt movement.
(2) Simulation of perception: imagining perceiving
something is essentially the same as actually
perceiving it, only the perceptual activity is generated
by the brain itself rather than by external stimuli.
(3) Anticipation: there exist associative
mechanisms that enable both behavioural and
perceptual activity to elicit other perceptual activity
in the sensory areas of the brain. Most importantly, a
simulated action can elicit perceptual activity that
resembles the activity that would have occurred if the
action had actually been performed.
Simulation of behaviour
In his remarkably insightful book, The Senses and
the Intellect from 1868, Alexander Bain suggested
that thinking is essentially a covert or ‘weak’ form
behaviour that does not activate the body and is
therefore invisible to an external observer [4].
‘Thinking’, he suggested, ‘is restrained speaking or
acting’ (p. 340). This idea, which was central to
behaviourism [5,6], was thought to have been
disproved when it was shown that subjects paralysed
by curare were still able to think [7]. It may have been
prematurely rejected, however and a slightly
modified version of it has lived on.
Behaviour is generated in a hierarchical fashion
in the frontal lobes. Activity in sensory cortex is
signalled via both intra- and sub-cortical pathways to
the anterior parts of the frontal lobe. The main signal
flow is then posteriorly through supplementary and
premotor cortex to the primary motor cortex. Single
muscle contractions are controlled by neurons in the
primary motor cortex. More complex movements,
such as gripping an object or saying a word, which
require temporally organized activation of several
muscles, are elicited by higher-level command signals
in more anterior neurons. In the prefrontal cortex
only the most global aspects of behaviour are
controlled. At all levels, the frontal cortex interacts
Conscious thought

perception
Germund Hesslow
A ‘simulation’ theory of cognitive function can be based on three assumptions
about brain function. First, behaviour can be simulated by activating motor
structures, as during an overt action but suppressing its execution. Second,
perception can be simulated by internal activation of sensory cortex, as during
normal perception of external stimuli. Third, both overt and covert actions can
elicit perceptual simulation of their normal consequences. A large body of
evidence supports these assumptions. It is argued that the simulation
approach can explain the relations between motor, sensory and cognitive
functions and the appearance of an inner world.

with the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, which
contribute to shaping the final movement commands.
The idea that behaviour can be simulated means
that the activity in the motor structures, which prepare
and initiate an action, can occur while its execution by
the primary motor cortex output is suppressed. There
is now an impressive body of evidence to support this
assumption (for reviews, see [8,9,10]).
Behavioural experiments have demonstrated a
number of striking parallels between simulated and
actual movements. The time it takes to simulate a
simple motor task corresponds closely to the time it
takes to perform the same task in reality. Decety et al.
had subjects walk blindfolded to familiar places,
indicating with a stopwatch when they started and
when they thought that they had reached the goal.
When they later imagined walking to the same
places, there was a close correspondence between the
time a particular subject used for the imagined and
the actual walk [11].
The most impressive evidence for the simulation
of behaviour assumption comes from studies using
imaging techniques. Ingvar and Philipsson [12]
showed that when subjects were instructed either to
simulate or physically perform hand movements,
activity increased in the pre-motor parts of the frontal
lobes, whereas only the overt movements activated
the primary motor cortex. Later studies have reported
similar findings [13]. Although there are some subtle
differences between imagined and executed
movements, many later studies using PET and fMRI
confirmed that there is activation of premotor and
supplementary motor areas during movement
simulation [14–16].
There is some recent evidence that the primary
motor cortex is also activated during simulation of
movement [16,17]. However, as no overt movement
actually results in these cases, and as most studies
fail to find activation, the activity of the primary
motor cortex is most probably weaker.
Simulation of perception
The idea that we can simulate perception by
activating the sensory areas of the brain so as to
mimic the activity normally initiated by the sense
organs was hinted at by Hume [3] and explicitly
formulated by several writers during the 19th
century [4,18], but the evidence for it is fairly 
recent [10,19,20].
Many investigators have compared the effects of
concrete manipulations of physical objects with the
corresponding ‘mental’manipulations. In Shepard
and Metzler’s ‘mental rotation task’ (Fig. 1a), for
instance, the time subjects took to find the solution
proved to be closely correlated with the degree of
rotation, as if the subjects were actually looking at
rotating objects and had to wait for them to rotate to
orientations at which they could be compared [21].
This and other similar experiments have been
interpreted as evidence that imagery uses the same
mechanisms as the visual system. Some investigators
have gone much further and claimed that ‘images’are
like pictures in the head, that they have ‘depictive’ or
‘pictorial’properties [20]. This controversial issue
need not concern us here (see [22] for discussion).
The simulation hypothesis does not rely on any
assumptions about the nature of imagery or
perception except that activity in sensory cortex can
be elicited internally.
Another source of evidence is cortical blindness.
Although the symptoms of damage to the visual
cortex are quite variable, many patients lose their
ability to form visual images [19]. A further striking
example is a report on patients with ‘unilateral
neglect syndrome’ (an inability to notice and respond
to stimuli in one half of the visual field after damage
to the contralateral parietal cortex) [23]. Such
patients were asked to imagine that they were
standing on one side of a familiar square and describe
what they could remember. They could describe
buildings only on the right side of the square, relative
to the imagined vantage point. When asked to
imagine standing at the opposite side of the square,
they could describe the buildings that were now in the
right visual field, but which they had been unable to
describe the first time [23].
The most compelling support for the simulation of
perception assumption comes from contemporary
functional imaging techniques. Imagining a visual
stimulus or performing a task that requires
visualization is accompanied by increased activity in
the primary visual cortex [24–26]. The same seems to
be true for specialized secondary visual areas. 
A region of the occipito-temporal cortex called the
fusiform face area is activated both when we see faces
[27] and also when we imagine them [28]. Lesions
that include this area impair both face recognition
[29] and the ability to imagine faces [30].
Anticipation
There is evidence both from animal behaviour and
human imaging studies, that perceptual simulation
can be elicited by other perceptual activity [31,32],

Fig. 1. (a) Mental rotation. Subjects are asked to determine if two
members of a pair of objects are identical or mirror images. It is usually
assumed that we solve the task by ‘mentally’ rotating one of the objects
until they can be ‘viewed’ from the same perspective. (b) The ‘Tower of
London’ task. There are three pouches, which can hold one, two and
three balls respectively. The task is to move one ball at a time between
the pouches in the lower panel in a minimum number of moves, so that
the resulting pattern matches that of the upper panel. The task can be
done physically or ‘mentally’.
but here we will only consider the possibility that
perceptual simulation can be elicited from the frontal
lobes by preparation for actions, or anticipation.
What we perceive is quite often determined by
our own behaviour: visual input is changed when we
move our head or eyes; tactile stimulation is
generated by manipulating objects in the hands. 
The sensory consequences of behaviour are to a large
extent predictable (Fig. 2a). The simulation
hypothesis postulates the existence of an associative
mechanism that enables the preparatory stages of an
action to elicit sensory activity that resembles the
activity normally caused by the completed overt
behaviour (Fig. 2b). A plausible neural substrate for
such a mechanism is the extensive fibre projection
from the frontal lobe to all parts of sensory cortex.
Very little is known about the function of these
pathways, but there is physiological evidence from
monkeys that neurons in polysensory cortex can be
modulated by movement [33].
Anticipation does not necessarily involve the
cerebral cortex. In classical conditioning of motor
responses, the association is made between the
conditioned stimulus and output neurons in the
cerebellum [34,35]. Fear conditioning occurs in the
amygdala, although conditioning to more complex
stimuli probably requires cortical mechanisms [36].
However, an anticipation mechanism of the sort
suggested above has obvious advantages. In
particular it would enable the organism to interrupt
activity that threatens to have dangerous
consequences in situations where classical
conditioning alone would be insufficient.
It is an interesting possibility that subcortical
conditioning mechanisms could contribute to
suppressing completion of a response ‘in preparation’.
Indeed, it has been suggested that the cerebellum
participates in such suppression [16]. The cerebellum
receives rich input from the visual cortex and
simulated vision could function as a conditioned
stimulus. If an initiated response is anticipated to
have negative consequences, the cerebellum could
generate a conditioned output signal to suppress
execution of the response (cf. discussion in Ref. [37]).
An example of interruption of initiated responses
might be the behaviour of rats in Tolman’s classical
T-maze experiments (see Box 1). In this situation,
rats might perform responses that have never been
differentially reinforced because they anticipate the
response that leads to the aversive stimulus, and then
suppress completion of the response. A selectionist
account of purposive behaviour could still be right,
but it is simulated responses rather than executed
ones that are selected.
Simulating chains of behaviour
Once the mechanism of anticipation is in place,
perceptual activity generated by a simulated action
can serve as a stimulus for a new response, and so on
(Fig. 2c), thus enabling long chains of simulated
responses and perceptions. By such simulated
interaction with the environment, an organism could
evaluate not only single responses, but also whole
courses of action, before putting them to physical,
potentially dangerous, tests. Obviously, even if no
overt movements and no sensory consequences occur,
a large part of what goes on inside the organism will
resemble the events arising during actual interaction
with the environment.
It is tempting at this point to assume that there
must be some part of the brain or some autonomous
agent or ‘self ’ that ‘performs’ the simulation by ‘using’
various structures, but that is expressly not what is
being suggested here. The anticipation mechanism
will ensure that most actions are accompanied by
probable perceptual consequences, so that during
normal behaviour, we will always, ‘in our thoughts’,
be a few steps ahead of the actual events. A simulation
can thus be triggered by the same stimuli that elicit
overt behaviour. Neither do we need to posit an
independent agent that ‘evaluates’ the simulation.
The (simulated) sensory events will elicit previously
learned emotional consequences, which can guide
future behaviour either by reinforcing or punishing
simulated actions (which may transfer to overt actions)
or by serving as discriminative stimuli. (This important
issue is outside the scope of this paper. For relevant
discussions see for example, Refs [38,39].)

response preparations will directly generate perceptual activity. 
(c) If the internally generated perceptual activity can elicit a response

responses and sensory consequences.
Simulating chains of behaviour is a plausible
interpretation of the problem-solving process in tasks
like the ‘Tower of London’ (Fig. 1) [40]. The subject can
test a certain move by simulating moving one ball,
thereby internally generating a perception of the new
configuration, which can function as a stimulus for
the next move, and so on until a good or bad result is
eventually achieved. Consistent with this suggestion, in
imaging experiments subjects working on the Tower of
London task show activation of premotor areas, including
the supplementary motor area, and sensory areas
(in particular the parietal and occipital cortices) [41,42].
A similar interpretation can be given of mental
rotation. Subjects trying to solve the Shepard and
Metzler task might simulate rotating the figures,
thereby activating premotor areas of the frontal
lobes and, as a consequence, sensory cortex. This has
indeed been found: EEG recordings have revealed
activation of premotor and parietal cortical areas
[43]. fMRI studies have similarly found activation of
the supplementary motor area as well as of the
parietal cortex during mental rotation [44,45].
(Under some circumstances, the sensory simulation
seems to be elicited by other sensory input rather
than by simulated movement [46].)
Simulation of behavioural chains could underlie
many other types of cognitive processes; for example,
playing chess or assembling a piece of furniture. If the

According to Thorndike’s ‘Law of Effect’, seemingly goal-
directed behaviour is a function of the consequences of
previous similar behaviour [a,b]. Thus, goal-directedness
is really an illusion and can be reduced to a causal
selection mechanism. However, animals sometimes
perform responses that seem obviously goal-directed, yet
have never been reinforced, as in the classic experiment
of Tolman and Gleitman (Fig. I) [c]. Why do rats perform
responses that have never been differentially reinforced?
A simple explanation in this case is that when a rat reaches
the choice point in the T-maze, it will sometimes initiate
the response that leads to the aversive stimulus, but
before the response is executed, it elicits the usual sensory
consequence (the sight of the dark goal box), which has
become aversive through conditioning. This would elicit
conditioned anxiety, which suppresses completion of the
initiated behaviour. 
A similar logic applies to the ‘revaluation’
phenomenon. In a typical experiment, rats were trained
to perform two different responses (pressing a lever, and
pulling a chain) for two different reinforcers. One
reinforcer was then paired repetitively with an aversive
substance (lithium chloride). When the rats were again
given the opportunity to respond, they avoided the
response that had been followed by the now ‘devalued’
reinforcer although this response had never been
punished [d,e].
Some authors have taken the revaluation phenomenon
as indicative of a serious limitation of classical learning
theory, and as evidence of causal ‘beliefs’ and true ‘goal
representations’ in rats [f]. A simpler explanation is that
the rats anticipate the consequences of a particular
response by simulating it.

preparation of a verbal response can generate activity
in the auditory cortex or in Wernicke’s area, it should
be possible to ‘hear’ it before it results in overt speech
and we should be able to speak to ourselves internally
(Fig. 3). We can respond to a question without being
conscious of our behaviour until a few hundred
milliseconds later [47]. Thus, a process consisting of
unconscious components might give rise to an inner
conversation and to what might be called ‘verbal
thinking’ [48].
Further advantages of the simulation hypothesis
In addition to the empirical evidence described above,
I would like to mention four attractive features of the
simulation hypothesis.
Role of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in cognitive
function
The simulation hypothesis makes sense of the
accumulating data showing that subcortical 
‘motor’ structures, such as the cerebellum and 
the basal ganglia, appear to be involved in 
cognitive tasks.
The cerebellum is activated during imagined
movements [16,49,50], in the Tower of London task
[41] and during mental rotation [51]. Cerebellar
lesions seem to cause various forms of cognitive
impairment [52]. This should not be surprising.
The cerebellum receives input from both frontal and
sensory cortex and one would expect the simulation of
both movement and perception to send signals to the
cerebellum. This is highlighted by adaptation to
laterally displacing prisms, which is now believed to
depend on the cerebellum [53]. Such adaptation can
occur when subjects merely imagine making pointing
errors [54], suggesting that visual simulation can also
send the appropriate error signals to the cerebellum.
The basal ganglia, particularly the striatum, 
are also activated during various cognitive tasks,
such as the Tower of London [41,42], and performance
in this task is impaired or altered in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease [55,56]. Patients with
Parkinson’s disease and lesions of the basal ganglia
also have other cognitive symptoms [57,58].
No extravagant ontological assumptions
The simulation hypothesis requires no assumptions
about the existence of ‘images’, ‘representations’ or
other mental entities. Simulation is conceptually firmly
tied to basic behavioural and neural processes. That
simple associations between actions and their sensory
consequences are sufficient for internal simulation is
demonstrated by recent robot simulations. Jirenhed
and Ziemke have shown that a robot can successfully
navigate in a simple environment using only
predicted stimuli as input [59,60].
No evolutionary leaps
Although there are some obvious quantitative
differences, the general construction of the human
brain is quite similar to that of other, cognitively
simpler, mammals, such as rats and cows, and it has
not evolved any radically novel circuits for dealing with
higher cognitive functions. From an evolutionary point
of view, therefore, cognitive functions are likely to be
based on more fundamental functions of the brain that
evolved to enable organisms to move about, find food
and reproduce. It is a strength of the simulation
hypothesis that it can account for cognitive functions in
terms of mechanisms shared by all mammals.
The inner world and consciousness
Perhaps the most exciting aspect of internal
simulation is that it suggests a mechanism for
generating the inner world that we associate with
consciousness. There are many problems of
consciousness, but one of them certainly is the
existence of an inner world of experience that does
not immediately depend on external input. How does
this inner world arise? The simulation hypothesis
provides a simple and straightforward answer.

Because simulation of behaviour and perception will
be accompanied by internally generated sensory
input resembling perceptions of the external world, it
will inevitably be accompanied by the experience of
an inner world [48].
Conclusion
The specific evidence for the first two assumptions 
of the simulation hypothesis, simulation of action
and simulation of perception, is quite strong. 
The third assumption is less well supported by
specific evidence but it is highly plausible. The 
most compelling argument in favour of the
simulation hypothesis overall is the fact that it
explains and makes sense of a wide range of
phenomena and that it does so without relying on 
extravagant assumptions about underlying 
brain mechanisms.
