Abstract
We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in relieving pain and improving
functioning for patients with failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). We also reviewed SCS
complications. Literature searches yielded 583 articles, of which seven met the inclusion criteria for the review of SCS effectiveness, and 15
others met the criteria only for the review of SCS complications. Two authors independently extracted data from each article, and then
resolved discrepancies by discussion. We identified only one randomized trial, which found that physical therapy (PT) plus SCS, compared
with PT alone, had a statistically significant but clinically modest effect at 6 and 12 months in relieving pain among patients with CRPS.
Similarly, six other studies of much lower methodological quality suggest mild to moderate improvement in pain with SCS. Pain relief with
SCS appears to decrease over time. The one randomized trial suggested no benefits of SCS in improving patient functioning. Although life-
threatening complications with SCS are rare, other adverse events are frequent. On average, 34% of patients who received a stimulator had an
adverse occurrence. We conclude with suggestions for methodologically stronger studies to provide more definitive data regarding the
effectiveness of SCS in relieving pain and improving functioning, short- and long-term, among patients with chronic pain syndromes.

1. Introduction
Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used since 1967
for the treatment of refractory chronic pain, particularly
failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS; chronic lumbar and
lower extremity pain after lumbar spine surgery) and
complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I. CRPS
type I, formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy
(RSD), is characterized by burning pain, allodynia, and
hyperalgesia. Both syndromes are encountered frequently in
specialized pain-treatment settings. FBSS is common
throughout the developed world, but especially in the
United States, where more surgery for low back and leg pain
is done per capita than in any other country (Cherkin et al.,
1994). For both FBSS and CRPS type I, treatments are
varied, scientifically unproven, and often costly.
The SCS apparatus may be implanted by different
methods. Some physicians use a trial period with externa-
lized leads; others use implantation without trial. Electrodes
can be implanted percutaneously into the epidural space or a
‘paddle’ electrode can be implanted via a small laminotomy.
Either type of electrode can be used in a trial with extension
leads coming through the skin and connected to an external
power supply. Either type of lead can be connected to a fully
implanted pulse generator that uses a built-in battery, or

a device can be implanted that is powered by an external
power supply utilizing radiofrequency-coupling with an
antenna taped to the skin over the receiver. Either type of
pulse generator can be programmed to select various
electrode combinations, voltage, and pulse width and
frequency. The electrodes and pulse generators have
evolved in the past 30 years; reliability and flexibility
have improved significantly.
Given the high costs of FBSS and CRPS as well as of
SCS, there is an urgent need for high-quality data regarding
the effectiveness of SCS in relieving pain and improving
function. This information is of great interest to patients
with chronic pain, physicians, and payers. In a previous
systematic review of the literature on SCS for FBSS (Turner
et al., 1995), we found the methodological quality of the
literature to be poor. The lack of randomized trials
precluded conclusions regarding the effectiveness of SCS
relative to other treatments, placebo, or no treatment. Only a
few studies reported long-term outcomes or information on
functional outcomes.
We have updated that review, guided by recently
published updated guidelines for systematic reviews (van
Tulder et al., 2003), and included studies of patients with
CRPS. We addressed two questions concerning SCS for
CRPS and FBSS:
1. What are the effects on pain and functioning, and do they
change over time?
2. What are the types and rates of complications?
In addition, we summarize the gaps in scientific know-
ledge of SCS outcomes and complications, and make
recommendations for future studies to better define the risks
and benefits of this technology.
2. Methods
2.1. Article selection
With the help of an experienced health services librarian,
we searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation
Index, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, and Current
Contents bibliographic databases back to their starting dates
for articles published before May 16, 2003 (the last search
date). We used 12 separate literature search strategies (see
Appendix A). In addition, we asked a representative of
Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN), a manufacturer of spinal
cord stimulators, for suggestions for articles to review (see
Appendix A for the search strategy used by Medtronic).
Finally, we searched our personal files, journals, and books,
and reviewed the bibliographies of relevant articles for
additional studies.
Two authors independently reviewed each citation to
determine whether it might meet our criteria for inclusion in
the review (described below). If either author thought that
the article might meet the inclusion criteria, two authors
then independently reviewed the abstract. If either thought,
based on the abstract, that the article might meet the
inclusion criteria, two authors then independently read the
entire article to make a final decision. Discrepancies in
decisions were resolved by discussion, with input from the
other authors as needed.
We classified the methodological strength of each study
using a scheme (Appendix B) modeled after that developed
by the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American
Academy of Neurology (Chang and Lowenstein, 2003). The
strongest evidence regarding the efficacy of a treatment
comes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with
pretreatment and follow-up assessment using standardized
measures of pain or functioning. The next strongest
evidence comes from non-randomized comparisons of
SCS to a control condition or an alternative treatment,
with such assessment. Uncontrolled case series do not
enable conclusions to be drawn concerning the effects of
SCS relative to no treatment or to an alternative treatment.
Had we found multiple RCTs, we would have limited our
review to RCTs. However, given the paucity of controlled
and comparison trials of SCS, we reviewed case series that
included pretreatment and follow-up assessment using
standardized measures of pain or functioning. Significant
changes in pain or functioning observed in such
studies would support the need for RCTs to assess the
efficacy of SCS.
The article inclusion criteria we used for our review of
SCS effectiveness were:
1. Publication: English-language journal article
2. Sample: $75% RSD/CRPS or FBSS (due to lumbar
radiculopathy, arachnoiditis, or no specified diagnosis,
but not to spinal cord injury, phantom limb pain,
peripheral neuropathy, malignancy, or peripheral vas-
cular disease) or outcomes data reported separately for
patients with FBSS or RSD/CRPS
3. Study design: class I (RCT), II (prospective matched
group cohort study or RCT that does not meet criteria for
class I), or III (controlled trial that does not meet criteria
for class I or II, or case series with scores reported for
pain or disability measures before SCS and at planned,
regular follow-ups; see Appendix B)
4. Data: Original data on pain or disability/work status
collected prior to SCS and for $75% of implanted
patients at $6 months follow-up on average.
The article exclusion criteria for our review of SCS
effectiveness were as follows.
(1) Data redundant with those in another published
article. In such cases, we made a case-by-case decision
about which article to include or whether to combine data
from articles reporting data on the same subjects. We
attempted to use the most comprehensive data set available
for a particular series of patients.
J.A. Turner et al. / Pain 108 (2004) 137–147138
(2) Article reporting data for patients with FBSS and
published prior to the searches for our last review (i.e. 1993
or earlier). (We did not review articles included in or
considered for our 1995 review, because we found the
literature at that time to consist of case series with generally
poor methodological quality; for example, 32 of the 39
studies included in our previous review did not even have
planned study protocols. Also, these case series largely
reflected experiences with stimulators in the 1980s and
stimulator technology has improved since that time; we
were interested in focusing on more recent studies using
technology more similar to that in use today. We did review
the literature prior to 1995 for CRPS studies to ensure we
were not missing any important or high-quality study. No
CRPS study prior to 1995 met our effectiveness review
inclusion criteria. All studies included in our 1995 review
and published in 1990 or later were considered for inclusion
in our current complications review. Only three of the 39
studies included in our previous review met the criteria for
our complications review, which were less stringent than
those for our effectiveness review.)
(3) Abstract from meeting or conference proceedings.
Because some articles that did not meet the inclusion
criteria for the review of effectiveness did provide useful
complications data, we used less restrictive inclusion
criteria for the review of SCS complications. We considered
all articles that did not meet the criteria for the effectiveness
review for inclusion in the review of complications. For the
review of complications, unlike the review of effectiveness,
we included: (1) articles published in 1990 or later, (2)
published meeting abstracts, (3) studies of all methodo-
logical classes (Appendix B), and (4) studies that did not
report pain or disability scores before SCS and for $75% of
implanted patients at a $6-month follow-up. We required
that complications data be reported for $75% of implanted
patients and for a minimum of 10 patients at a $1-month
follow-up. We excluded articles when the number of
patients assessed for complications was unclear.
2.2. Review of included articles
Two authors independently read each article that met the
inclusion criteria and extracted information on study
characteristics, outcomes (pain and functioning), and
complications using a form developed for this purpose.
Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Because only
one RCT was identified, quantitative analysis of aggregate
data from different studies (meta-analysis) was not possible.
Therefore, the results are presented descriptively.
3. Results
3.1. Search results
Our searches yielded 583 articles. Two authors indepen-
dently judged 197 to potentially meet the review inclusion
criteria and reviewed these abstracts and/or entire articles to
make a final determination. Seven articles met the inclusion
criteria for the review of effectiveness and 15 others met the
inclusion criteria for the review of complications. There
were no randomized or even nonrandomized controlled
trials comparing SCS to a control condition or alternative
therapy (e.g. physical therapy (PT), medication) that were
excluded due to follow-up for ,75% of implanted patients
or follow-up ,6 months.
3.2. Study characteristics
Table 1 summarizes the seven articles (two CRPS, three
FBSS, two mixed diagnoses) that met the effectiveness
review inclusion criteria. Only one study was class I, all
others were class III. The articles are listed by class and,
within class III, by patient diagnosis (and within diagnosis,
from most to least recent). Three articles did not report dates
of SCS implantation; the other studies were performed in
the 1990s (1992–1998). The number of patients who
received permanent implants ranged from 23 to 80 and the
number available for follow-up assessment ranged from 23
to 62. No study reported the number of patients who were
receiving worker’s compensation benefits. Average patient
pain duration ranged from 40 to 84 months in the three
articles that reported this information. Among the three
studies that included patients with FBSS and reported the
number of previous spine operations, the average ranged
from 2 to 3.3. SCS implantation methods were percutaneous
trial followed by percutaneous implantation (two studies),
percutaneous trial followed by laminectomy (one study),
direct implant by laminectomy without a trial (one study), or
a combination of techniques (three studies). The mean time
to follow-up ranged from 6 to 60 months across studies
(mean 33.6 months). For the four studies that reported the
proportion of patients screened with temporary electrodes
who received (based on sufficient pain relief) permanent
implantation, the mean was 72% (range 58–96%). Two
articles acknowledged funding from Medtronic, one
acknowledged government funding, one stated that no
financial support was received, and three did not mention
any financial support.
3.3. Is SCS effective in relieving pain?
We identified only one randomized trial, which we
classified as class I. In this study, patients with CRPS type I
described as unable to work due to severe pain and
disability, and unresponsive to PT and other treatment,
were randomized to either SCS plus PT ðn ¼ 36Þ or PT
alone (n ¼ 18; Kemler et al., 2000). Trial SCS was
successful in 24 of the 36 patients randomized to SCS,
and they received permanent stimulators. In an intention-to-
treat analysis, at 6 months, pain intensity decreased from
baseline on average by 2.4 cm (SD 2.5) on a 10-cm visual
analogue scale (VAS) among the 36 patients randomized to
J.A. Turner et al. / Pain 108 (2004) 137–147 139
PT plus SCS (24 who received stimulators and 12 who did
not), and increased by 0.2 cm (SD 1.6) in the PT-only group
ðP , 0:001Þ: Among the 36 patients assigned to PT plus
SCS, 50% showed a $50% decrease in VAS pain intensity.
Among the 24 patients who received a permanent
stimulator, the pain intensity VAS rating decreased by
3.6 cm (SD 2.0) on average. A subsequent article (Kemler
and Furnee, 2002) reported 1-year outcomes. From baseline
to 1 year, pain intensity decreased from an average of 7.1 to
4.4 in the group randomized to PT plus SCS, and increased
from 6.7 to 7.1 in the group randomized to PT-only
ðP , 0:001Þ:
From this RCT, we calculated the number needed to treat
(NNT), a widely used measure of treatment effectiveness.
We calculated the NNT conservatively, by using patient
ratings of ‘much improved’ from treatment as the outcome
(some patients had a pain reduction of .50% but did not
rate themselves as much improved) and using all patients
assigned to SCS (not just the patients who had successful
trial stimulation and therefore received a permanent
stimulator). The NNT for this study was 3, indicating that
among patients with CRPS type I treated with PT, three
people need to be given a trial of SCS for one of them to
report much pain improvement 6 months later. We could not
calculate the NNT for .50% pain relief because this
information was not reported for the PT-only group.
As summarized in Table 1, improvement in pain after
stimulator implantation was also found in the five class III

studies that reported on pain. The average improvement was
mild to moderate. The two studies of FBSS patients that
reported leg and back pain separately both found greater
improvement in leg than in back pain with SCS.
3.4. Is SCS effective in improving functioning?
In the only RCT, 36 patients randomized to SCS plus PT
did not differ from 18 patients randomized to PT alone in
improvement on any functional status measure at 6 months
(Kemler et al., 2000). At 1 year, the SCS group was
significantly ðP ¼ 0:004Þ more improved on the EQ-5D
(EuroQol Group, 1990), a measure of health-related quality
of life in relation to mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression (Kemler and
Furnee, 2002). However, the extent to which this reflected
improvement in functioning versus pain and mood is
unclear.
Among the six class III studies, three (Alo et al., 2002;
Calvillo et al., 1998; Villavicencio et al., 2000) did not
report any functional status data. One (Kumar et al., 2002)
reported greater improvement on disability scores averaged
over a 5-year follow-up period among 60 FBSS patients
who received permanent SCS than among 44 FBSS patients
who did not because they failed trial stimulation. However,
it is unclear whether this difference was statistically
significant and these patient groups may have differed in
important ways at baseline. One study (Dario et al., 2001)
found significantly greater disability improvement among
20 FBSS patients treated medically than among 23 FBSS
patients treated with SCS. However, the groups differed in
disability severity at baseline and the medical treatment
group consisted of medical treatment responders, whereas
only patients who did not respond to medical treatment
received SCS. Because the groups were not comparable at
baseline, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the relative
benefits of SCS versus medical therapy in improving patient
functioning. The authors reported that the SCS group
improved in disability, but not whether this improvement
was statistically or clinically significant. A fifth study
(Ohnmeiss et al., 1996) found statistically significant but
modest improvements on the Sickness Impact Profile
(Bergner et al., 1981) physical disability and total sickness
impact (including physical and psychosocial dysfunction)
scales in a group of 40 FBSS patients at 1 and 2 years.
However, there was no comparison group, so conclusions
regarding the efficacy of SCS cannot be drawn.
Five class III articles reported on work status. The only
one of these that involved patients with CRPS (Calvillo
et al., 1998) stated that 41% of 24 patients returned to work,
but some received a peripheral nerve stimulator in addition
to SCS. Among three studies of patients with FBSS, one
(Dario et al., 2001) reported that among 23 patients, eight
resumed work and two stopped working after SCS
implantation. The second (Ohnmeiss et al., 1996) stated
that no patients were working before SCS implantation
(several were retired) but at 2-year follow-up, four of the
32 patients were working. The third (Kumar et al., 2002)
reported that 15% of 60 patients who received SCS returned
to work in contrast to none of the 44 patients who failed trial
stimulation and did not receive permanent SCS. However, it
is unclear whether these groups were comparable at baseline
in proportions of patients with return to work as a goal or in
other patient characteristics that might affect return to work.
In a study of 27 patients with mixed diagnoses (Villavi-
cencio et al., 2000), five of eight patients working before
stimulator implantation went back to work, two retired, and
one was unable to work because of pain after implantation.
This article did not report whether any patients not working
before implantation returned to work afterwards. In sum, no
conclusions can be drawn regarding effectiveness of SCS in
returning patients to work because these were all uncon-
trolled studies and none provided sufficient detail to allow
calculation of work rates at follow-up among patients
working and not working before SCS.
3.5. Do SCS effects on pain and functioning
change over time?
Most articles did not report data that could answer the
question of whether SCS effects on pain and functioning
change over time. However, there is some suggestion that
pain relief reported after SCS decreases over time. One
article (Alo et al., 2002) reported outcomes of patients with
mixed diagnoses at 24, 30, and 48 months. Although
48-month data were not obtained from all patients, median
pain ratings were significantly higher (but still significantly
lower than baseline levels) at 30 ðn ¼ 79Þ and 48 months
ðn ¼ 62Þ than at 24 months ðn ¼ 80Þ. At 30 months, 72% of
patients who had received stimulators were still using them,
but at 48 months only 37% were using them. Also, at 30
months 80% of the patients said they would undergo the
procedure if they had it to do over again, but at 48 months
only 30% said they would have the procedure again. A
common reason for not wanting to repeat the procedure, and
the most common reason for device removal, was pain at the
receiver site. These findings should be interpreted in light of
the well-known problems with the equipment used in this
series, resulting in an unusually high revision rate and
reimplantation of some patients with different equipment.
However, findings in two other studies also suggest
diminishing pain relief with SCS over time. Among
40 FBSS patients, benefit from SCS was reported by 83%
at 12 months and by 70% at 24 months (Ohnmeiss et al.,
1996). Mean leg pain increased somewhat from 12 to
24 months. Among 24 CRPS patients, pain appeared to
increase slightly over time (Calvillo et al., 1998). However,
in both studies, it is unclear whether this change was
statistically or clinically significant. Figures in another
article (Dario et al., 2001) show no apparent increase in
pain among 23 FBSS patients over time (follow-up range
24–84 months), but it is unclear what proportion of
J.A. Turner et al. / Pain 108 (2004) 137–147 141
the original sample was included in each follow-up and how
patient attrition over time may have affected the results.
3.6. Complications
One study (Dario et al., 2001) included in the effective-
ness review did not report complications data. Table 2
shows (in order of publication date), for each study included
in the complications review, the number of patients assessed
for complications and their diagnoses, dates stimulators
implanted, mean length of follow-up, and percent of patients
with one or more complications. With a few exceptions,
sample sizes were small. Lengths of follow-up and reported
complication rates were highly variable.
Table 3 summarizes the types and rates of complications,
and the number of articles that reported information for each
complication. The mean rates across studies are weighted by
study sample size. We did not weight means by length of

follow-up because follow-up times tended to vary widely
for patients within studies and few studies had short follow-
ups on average. A comparison of studies with 3 or more
years versus ,3 years of follow-up on average suggested no
difference in overall complication rates.
The first row of Table 3 shows that, across the 18 articles
that reported sufficient information to calculate this, a
weighted average of 34% (range 0–81%) of patients who
received a permanent stimulator had one or more undesir-
able outcomes during the study follow-up period. These
included superficial and deep infections, local pain in the
region of stimulator components, biological complications
other than infection or local pain (e.g. dural puncture),
equipment failure, a stimulator revision (additional opera-
tion to correct an equipment problem; we did not include
battery changes in this category), and stimulator removal
(most commonly because of infection, equipment failure, or
lack of pain relief). Removals included both permanent
removals and removals followed by eventual reimplanta-
tions (e.g. removal due to infection and stimulator
implantation after resolution of the infection).
Complications can be associated with test stimulation as
well as with a permanently implanted stimulator. For
example, 11% of 36 patients in the RCT had a dural
puncture during test stimulation (Kemler et al., 2000).
However, we were unable to review test stimulation
complication rates because very few studies reported this
information.
The most common adverse event was a stimulator
revision (additional operation), most frequently due to a
need to reposition the electrodes. We considered electrode
repositioning to be an adverse occurrence, but not an
equipment failure. A mean of 10.2% of patients had some
type of equipment failure, although as we noted previously,
one study (Alo et al., 2002) had particularly high equipment
failure and removal rates because of problematic equip-
ment. Thus, the medians may more accurately reflect the
true failure and removal rates (medians 6.5 and 6%,
respectively). Although deep infections (e.g. epidural
abscess) were rare (only one reported case), the mean rate
of superficial infections across studies was 4.5% (range
0–12%).
Battery replacement is another reason for stimulator
revision. However, because most articles did not report on
this, we did not include battery replacement in Table 3.
Most studies had average follow-ups of 4 years or less and
therefore presumably no additional operations for battery
replacement (batteries typically last 4–5 years).
4. Discussion
The strongest level of evidence for the efficacy of a pain
treatment, at least one systematic review of multiple well-
designed RCTs (McQuay et al., 1997), is not available for
SCS. The next strongest level of evidence (McQuay et al.,
1997; van Tulder et al., 2003), a well-designed RCT of
appropriate size, is available and indicates that SCS plus PT
has a statistically significant but clinically modest effect on
CRPS type I pain, as compared with PT-only, at 6 months
(Kemler et al., 2000) and 1 year (Kemler and Furnee, 2002).
In our previous review (Turner et al., 1995) of the
literature, which consisted entirely of (mostly retrospective)
case series, we concluded that approximately 50–60% of
patients with FBSS report $50% pain relief with SCS.
Similar results were obtained for CRPS patients in the
recent RCT (Kemler et al., 2000): 50% of patients
randomized to SCS (including 24 who received SCS and
12 who did not) had a 50% or greater decrease in pain at
6 months. The class III studies that reported pain relief with
SCS (one of CRPS patients, two of FBSS patients, and two
with mixed samples) were consistent in findings of mild to
moderate improvement on average. As a group, these
findings suggest that the effects of SCS on pain appear to be
similar for patients with CRPS and FBSS, but studies
directly comparing the effects of SCS for the two syndromes
are needed to confirm this.
Because the RCT was not blinded and because surgical
techniques may have powerful non-specific (placebo)
effects (Moseley et al., 2002; Turner et al., 1994), the
extent to which pain relief is due to specific effects of SCS
versus placebo effects is unknown. The lack of other
randomized trials or studies with comparable comparison
groups prevents us from reaching conclusions about the
effectiveness of SCS compared with other medical
treatments.
The RCT (Kemler et al., 2000) found no effect of SCS
beyond that of PT on measures of functional status at
6 months among patients with severe CRPS pain and
disability. However, the statistical power of the study to
detect differences between treatment groups in effects on
functioning was not reported. All three lower-quality
(class III) studies with functional status data (all of patients
with FBSS) reported improvement. However, because
appropriate comparison groups were not used, the extent
to which disability improvement was due to SCS (versus
natural history or non-specific effects) and the effects of
SCS relative to other treatments are unknown. In sum, the
strongest evidence suggests no benefits of SCS in improving
functioning of patients with CRPS type I, but other studies
are needed to confirm this finding and determine its
generalizability to other patient populations (e.g.
patients with different clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics).
We could not reach conclusions regarding the effects of
SCS on work status because no article systematically
reported patient work status before and after SCS and rates
of return to work in patients for whom return to work was a
goal. Of course, among patients with long-standing pain and
disability, many factors in addition to biological variables
may affect return to work, including job availability, patient
fears of reinjury, and compensation issues.
J.A. Turner et al. / Pain 108 (2004) 137–147 143
The paucity of methodologically strong studies exami-
ning the effectiveness of SCS is by no means unique in the
literature of chronic pain treatments. For example, there is
little empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of any
surgical treatment for chronic low back pain. A Cochrane
review concluded that there is no scientific evidence
regarding the effectiveness of any form of surgical
decompression (e.g. laminectomy, laminotomy) or fusion
(with or without instrumentation) for degenerative lumbar
spondylosis (degenerative disc disease) compared with
natural history, placebo, or conservative treatment (Gibson
et al., 2003).
Although life-threatening complications with SCS are
very rare, other adverse occurrences are frequent. Infection
in the spinal canal is rare, but local infections at the site of
the receiver/stimulator or the connector between the lead
and the electrode are more common (4.5% on average).
Surgical removal of the stimulator component from the
region of infection is usually required. The weighted
average rate of pain at the site of the electrode connector
or receiver/stimulator was 6% across studies. Stimulator
revisions (involving additional operations) are common,
with increasing frequency over time after the original
implantation. The weighted average rate of revisions for
reasons other than battery replacement was 23%. The
median rate of temporary or permanent removal of the
stimulator was 6%. These average complication rates should
be considered tentative. It is unclear how systematically
each type of complication was assessed or reported in the
papers. Furthermore, the studies were quite heterogeneous.
The reported complication rates varied widely across
studies, and it is probable that differences in patients, SCS
equipment, clinical settings, complication assessment and
reporting, length of follow-up (which varied widely within
and across studies), and other factors all influenced reported
numbers of complications. Prospective studies with sys-
tematic assessment of adverse events associated with trial
stimulation and permanent stimulator implantation are
needed in order to better estimate overall and specific
complication rates.
The question of whether SCS effects change over time
cannot be answered definitively. The literature suggests that
pain relief with SCS may decrease over time, consistent
with our previous conclusion (Turner et al., 1995).
However, a prospective study with assessment of pain and
functioning at planned, regular follow-ups over a period of
years, and a comparable control group, is needed.
Two studies that did not meet the review inclusion
criteria warrant mention. A randomized trial (North et al.,
1994) comparing SCS versus reoperation in FBSS patients
selected for reoperation was excluded because neither pain
nor functional outcomes were reported. Among 81 patients
identified as eligible, 51 consented to randomization and
30 chose reoperation outside the study. Data at the 6-month
follow-up (when patients were eligible for crossover to the
other study arm) were reported for only 27 of the 51
participants. Among 15 patients who had undergone
reoperation, 10 (67%) opted for crossover to SCS. Among
12 patients who received SCS, 2 (17%) opted for crossover
to reoperation. A subsequent article (North and Wetzel,
2002) reported SCS to be more effective than reoperation
for 90% of patients at a 3-year follow-up, with significantly
better outcomes and lower rates of crossover. The authors
also reported that patients randomized to reoperation used
significantly more opiate analgesics than did those random-
ized to SCS, and that measures of activities of daily living
and work status did not differ significantly. However, no
further details were published, so we are unable to evaluate
this report.
A large prospective multicenter study was excluded
because only 70 of 182 FBSS patients who received a
permanent spinal cord stimulator completed the follow-up
(Burchiel et al., 1996). One-year follow-up data showed
statistically significant improvement in measures of pain
and quality of life, but not in medication use or work status.
It is unknown how representative these patients were of the
original sample.
The following important questions concerning the effects
of SCS remain unanswered: (1) What are the effects of SCS
on pain and functioning among patients with different
chronic pain conditions, compared with ‘usual care,’ other
treatments (e.g. PT, multidisciplinary pain-treatment pro-
grams), and placebo controls, and do these effects diminish
over time? (2) Among injured workers with chronic pain,
what is the impact of SCS on work status? (3) Do certain
SCS parameters result in significantly better patient out-
comes or lower complication rates? Table 4 lists our
recommendations for future studies to increase knowledge
in these areas. Additional randomized trials are clearly
indicated. A fully blinded comparison of SCS with a
‘placebo’ control condition such as sham stimulation may
be difficult to achieve because paresthesias that cover the
painful area are an important component of SCS. Random-
ized comparisons of SCS with other treatments (e.g.
multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment, medication
management, PT), although challenging due to the high
costs of these treatments and need for large sample sizes, are
possible and could be done in multi-site studies. Suggestions
are also made in Table 4 for improving the methodological
quality of non-randomized studies, as standardized study
protocols with administration of valid and reliable measures
of pain and functioning at baseline and at planned follow-
ups could help shed light on the above questions.
We conclude that the literature on SCS for FBSS and
CRPS remains inadequate to make definitive statements
about efficacy in reducing physical disability, work
disability, and medication consumption. Using recently
published criteria for levels of evidence (van Tulder et al.,
2003), there is moderate evidence (one high-quality RCT)
that SCS plus PT is more effective than PT-only for patients
with CRPS type I in relieving pain at 6- and 12-month
follow-ups. Both the RCT and lower-quality studies suggest
J.A. Turner et al. / Pain 108 (2004) 137–147144
a modest pain-relieving effect on average. Less regarding
comparisons with placebo controls, other treatments, or the
natural history can be gleaned from the literature.
Complications leading to the need for additional surgeries
have been common.
