Movement Intention After Parietal
Cortex Stimulation in Humans
Michel Desmurget,1,2 Karen T. Reilly,1,2 Nathalie Richard,1,2 Alexandru Szathmari,3
Carmine Mottolese,3 Angela Sirigu1,2*
Parietal and premotor cortex regions are serious contenders for bringing motor intentions and
motor responses into awareness. We used electrical stimulation in seven patients undergoing
awake brain surgery. Stimulating the right inferior parietal regions triggered a strong intention
and desire to move the contralateral hand, arm, or foot, whereas stimulating the left inferior
parietal region provoked the intention to move the lips and to talk. When stimulation intensity was
increased in parietal areas, participants believed they had really performed these movements,
although no electromyographic activity was detected. Stimulation of the premotor region triggered
overt mouth and contralateral limb movements. Yet, patients firmly denied that they had moved.
Conscious intention and motor awareness thus arise from increased parietal activity before
movement execution.
Acentral question in the study of humanbehavior concerns the origin of willedactions. Where in the brain are intentions
formed? How do we become aware of these
intentions? According to the dualist philosophy
(1), our encephalon is just the recipient of con-
scious intentions formed elsewhere in a non-
physical realm. This implies that conscious intention
comes first, as the leading cause of our actions.
Although appealing from a spiritual point of view,
this hypothesis was progressively challenged by a
large set of studies (2–4). Results showing that the
decision to move did not precede, but instead
lagged, the onset of brain activity signaling motor
preparedness were especially convincing (5–7).
Thus, researchers suggested that conscious inten-
tion of a movement emerged as a consequence of
increased neural activity in a premotor-parietal cir-
cuit, which elaborates motor plans before action
(2). This cortical circuit has also been involved in
motor awareness, that is, the awareness that we are
actually executing the intended action (7–10).
However, the specific contribution of premo-
tor and parietal regions to conscious intention and
motor awareness remains unclear. We reasoned
that, by directly stimulating parietal and premotor
cortex regions, we should be able to evoke motor
responses in specific body parts and that, in areas
involved in carrying out advance computations
related to conscious intention and motor aware-
ness, these movements should be accompanied
or preceded by the subjective experience of willed
actions. We used direct electrical stimulation
(DES) in seven individuals with brain tumors
located anteriorly (N = 4, PM1 to PM4) or pos-
teriorly (N = 3, PP1 to PP3) to the central sulcus.
Patients were operated under local anesthesia by
using DES as a functional mapping technique
in order to minimize the risk of postoperative
sequelae (11). DES was delivered with a bipolar
electrode using standard increasing intensities
(2, 5, and 8 mA) and durations (1, 2, and 4 s).
Up to four replications were performed for each
stimulation site. Replications were delivered non-
consecutively to avoid provoking seizures.
Throughout the experiment, electromyographic
(EMG) signals were collected in the contrale-
sional hemibody in 12 muscles covering the face,
hand, wrist, elbow, knee, and foot. Stimulation
sites were localized with high resolution on in-
dividual magnetic resonance (MR) images by
using a peri-operative neuronavigation system
and reconstructed offline.
Fifty-seven sites were stimulated in the frontal,
parietal, and temporal regions (fig. S2A). Posterior
parietal stimulations were performed in Brodmann
areas (BAs) 7, 39, and 40. Premotor stimulations
were performed in the dorsal sector of BA 6,
excluding the convexity and mesial structures
involving the supplementary motor area (SMA).
Of the stimulated sites, 46%were silent, meaning
that DES did not produce any sensations or overt
motor responses, and 20% were associated with
somatic sensations such as tingling or itching.
One participant (PP1) reported a robust visual
illusion of background displacement when stim-
ulated in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22). Of
the remaining sites (34%), 16% evoked responses
related tomotor awareness ormovement intention,
whereas 18% triggered actual movements. We
will focus on these remaining sites, designated
as responsive. The distribution of DES effects
across brain areas is summarized in fig. S2B.
For the three patients with postcentral tumors,
nine responsive sites were found in BAs 39 and
40 (Fig. 1). Stimulation of all these sites produced
a pure intention, that is, a felt desire to move
without any overt movement being produced or
EMG activity recorded in the concernedmuscles.
In two of the patients (PP1 and PP2), the same
sites were stimulated again later but at a higher
intensity. Conscious motor intentions were re-
placed by a sensation that a movement had
been accomplished, and yet, just as during the
first stimulation trial, no actual movement or
EMG activity was observed. Thus, these patients
experienced awareness of an illusory movement
(Fig. 2). For example, patient PP3 reported after
low-intensity stimulation of one site (5 mA, 4 s;

site a in Fig. 1), “I felt a desire to lick my lips”
and at a higher intensity (8 mA, 4 s), “I moved
my mouth, I talked, what did I say?” Similar
results were found in patient PP1 for hand (two
sites, g and h, in Fig. 1) and foot (one site, f, in Fig.
1) movements. Patient PP2 reported, after stimu-
lation in BA 40 (8 mA, 4 s; site e in Fig. 1), that
she felt “like a will to move” her chest (12). The
same words were later used for another site with
respect to the arm (8 mA, 4 s; site c in Fig. 1).
Without prompting by the examiner, all three
patients spontaneously used terms such as “will,”
“desire,” and “wanting to,” which convey the
voluntary character of themovement intention and
its attribution to an internal source, that is, located
within the self (movies S2 and S3).
Electrical stimulation in the frontal cortex
contrasted sharply with the above descriptions
(Fig. 3). For the four precentral patients, 10
responsive sites were found in the dorsal part of
the premotor cortex (BA 6; Fig. 1). These sites
triggered movements of various limb segments
and the mouth (fig. S2C) (13) devoid of con-
scious intention and awareness. Patients never
expressed the desire to move and never became
aware that they produced a motor response. For
example, during stimulation patient PM1 exhib-
ited a largemultijoint movement involving flexion
of the left wrist, fingers, and elbow, as well as a
rotation of the forearm (8mA, 4 s; site 7 in Fig. 1).
He did not spontaneously comment on this, and
when asked whether he had felt a movement he
responded negatively. The ability of patients to
detect electrically evoked movements did not
change with the intensity of the stimulation.
Higher currents evoked larger movements and

recruited more muscles as compared with move-
ments triggered by lower currents. Despite
increasing stimulation intensity, patients remained
completely unaware that a movement occurred
(movies S1 and S4) (14).
We report two main contrasting findings: (i)
Stimulation of the posterior parietal cortex caused
human participants to intend to move and to
report having moved, even in the absence of ac-
tual motor responses. (ii) Stimulation of the pre-
motor cortex triggered limb andmouthmovements
that were not consciously detected by the patients.
Clinical observations of high-level movement
deficits in patients with apraxia after parietal dam-
age have led to the hypothesis that the posterior
parietal cortex contains stored movement repre-
sentations (15, 16). It can be proposed that direct
stimulation of the parietal cortex activates such
representations. However, the fact that patients
experienced a conscious desire to move indicates
that stimulation did not merely evoke a mental
image of a movement but also the intention to
produce a movement, an internal state that resem-
bles what Searle called “intention in action” (17).
This finding is consistent with nonhuman primate
results suggesting that the posterior parietal cortex
harbors a “map of intentions,” with different
subregions dedicated to the planning of eye, reach-
ing, and grasping movements (18), and that ac-
tivity of parietal neurons is highly correlated to
processes of motor planning and decision-making
(19, 20). It is tempting to propose that electrically
induced intentions arise, in our study, from the
activation of some nodes within this intentional
map. Interestingly, when the stimulation intensity
was increased, motor intentions were replaced by
a form of illusory movement awareness. In the
absence of any muscle contraction, the patients
reported that they had actually performed the
movement they previously intended to do.
Although the nature of this phenomenon cannot
be formally elucidated here, it may be hypothe-
sized that motor intention arises from the
activation of a limited subregion within the cor-
tical network activated during movement execu-
tion. According to this view, higher intensities of
stimulation would not simply prime a motor
representation to consciousness (giving rise to
intention) but also recruit the executive network
responsible for movement monitoring through
forward modeling. This process of forward mod-
eling has been shown to rely on posterior parietal
computations (21–23). It could form the basis of
the illusory movement awareness experienced by
our patients, assuming that the signal we are
aware of when making a movement does not
emerge from the movement itself but rather from
the predictions we make about the movement in
advance of action (3, 4, 7, 24, 25).
It has been reported that stimulation of the
SMA triggers an urge to move that resembles an
irrepressible desire tomove going beyond patients’
will (26). This suggests a potential role of SMA
in generating motor intentions (2, 27). However,
intentions evoked by stimulation of SMA stand
in contrast with what was described by our
patients, who reported experiencing an endoge-
nously generated wish to move. The imperative
character of the motor intention with SMA
stimulation is demonstrated by the fact that higher
currents triggered movements (26), whereas none
of the stimulated parietal sites ever evoked actual
muscle contractions. It is possible that both the
parietal cortex and the SMA are linked to motor
intentions but that intentions processed in these
two regions correspond to different stages of
movement planning: Intentions in the parietal lobe
may be processed in relation to sensory predic-
tions, whereas in the SMA intentions may be
more closely related to motor commands.
Regarding the dorsal premotor cortex, stim-
ulations triggered complex multijoint movements,
as already reported in awake monkeys (28).
Stimulation intensities were comparable to those
performed in the parietal cortex. Yet, patients
remained unable to detect the limb and mouth
movements evoked by electrical stimulations. This
suggests that the proprioceptive volleys associated
with the movement were disregarded or not de-
codable by the brain areas which normally receive
these feedback signals. This finding strengthens
the conclusion that awareness of initiating and
executing amovement is not derived from afferent
inputs but rather from the internal computations
carried out in the posterior parietal cortex before
action (2–4, 7). Our data are compatible with
behavioral studies showing that we are largely
unaware of sensory feedback about the ongoing
state of ourmotor system, as long as our intentions
are achieved (4). Peripheral inputs probably
intervene at a further stage for comparing expected
and actual movements, that is, when we need to
construct a veridical motor awareness (2, 24, 25).
Recently, Berti et al. (9) have linked the com-
parative process leading to veridical awareness to
the functioning of the dorsal premotor cortex
(BA 6). As shown by the authors, this structure is
the most commonly lesioned in hemiplegic
patients who obstinately claim that they can move
their paralyzed limbs. In our study, premotor
stimulations did not evoke any form of conscious
intention. As a consequence, the proprioceptive
inputs could not be compared to any expected
input to estimate movement state to construct a
veridical motor awareness.
Our study suggests that motor intention and
awareness are emerging consequences of increased
parietal activity before movement execution. The
subjective (and potentially illusory) feeling that
we are executing a movement does not arise from
movement itself, but it is generated by prior con-
scious intention and its predicted consequences.

12. This result is consistent with monkey studies showing that
protrusion movements of the chest are represented in the
posterior parietal cortex (29).
13. The movements observed in our premotor patients were
similar to the movements reported in monkeys after
long train stimulations (28). It is thought that these
electrically induced movements are functionally
meaningful (30, 31).
14. The possibility can be ruled out that the absence of
motor awareness in our patients was due to a low level
of vigilance. The anesthetic and stimulation protocols
were identical in premotor and in parietal patients who
did report illusory movements. During peri-operative
functional evaluation, premotor patients appeared well
awake (see movies S1 to S4) and otherwise behaved as
the parietal patients: They could talk, count, or move in
response to verbal commands. Some of them reported
sensory feelings of tingling or itching, indicating that
they could introspect on stimulation-induced experiences.
In one patient (PM4), we examined whether unseen
passive movements of the forearm were perceived and
reported. Indeed, this was the case.
