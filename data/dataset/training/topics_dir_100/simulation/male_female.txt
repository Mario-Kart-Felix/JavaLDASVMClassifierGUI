"The Science and Politics of  Comparing 
Women and Men" (Eagly, March 1995) 
raised an important question: What consti- 
tutes a practically significant sex effect? The 
practice of relying on proportion of variance 
measures (e.g., r 2, tt~ 2) to address this ques- 
tion has been judged inappropriate, for such 
measures are not intuitively accessible and 
can mislead researchers into ignoring the prac- 
tical significance of small effects. In response, 
more easily understood metrics such as the 
binomial effects size display (Rosenthal & 
Rubin, 1982) and the common language ef- 
fect (McGraw & Wong, 1992) have been 
introduced. However, Eagly concluded that 
even these approaches are not entirely 
sufficient: 
The evaluation of the . . . importance of sex- 
related differences should not end with the 
translation of them into metrics that are eas- 
ily understood. In practical terms, the impor- 
tance of a difference depends on the conse- 
quences of the behavior in natural settings. 
(p. 152) 
"We agree with Eagly and recommend the use 
of computer simulations as a tool for assess- 
ing the impact of sex differences. 
Consider male-female differences in 
work performance ratings and how a com- 
puter simulation might help to resolve some 
of the interpretive difficulties raised by Eagly 
(1995). As discussed in a recent American 
Psychological Association Amicus Curie 
Brief (American Psychological Association, 
1991) filed in the Price Waterhouse v 
Hopkins (1989) Supreme Court case of al- 
leged workplace discrimination, women's 
work is often evaluated less favorably than 
men's. However, several rebuttals argued 
against the practical importance of the re- 
search findings cited in the brief noting, among 
other things, that sex bias effects are quite 
small, accounting for only approximately 
1% to 5% of the variance in work perfor- 
mance ratings (e.g., Barrett & Morris, 1993). 
Overlooked in this debate, and what a com- 
puter simulation would force researchers to 
consider, are the "real world" parameters 
likely to influence the effects of male-female

differences in performance ratings. Two or- 
ganizational characteristics are especially rel- 
evant. First is the pyramid structure of most 
organizations, in which there are increas- 
ingly fewer positions as one attempts to 
climb to the top. Second, because most orga- 
nizations rely on a tournament model, in 
which early career success is a necessary 
precondition for subsequent promotion, ini- 
tial performance ratings strongly influence 
the likelihood of whether an individual 
reaches  a top management  pos i t ion  
(Rosenbaum, 1979). To assess the extent to 
which these two facts of organizational life 
might limit the upward mobility of women, 
even when male-female differences in per- 
formance ratings are quite small, the follow- 
ing computer simulation was conducted.. 
The simulation, which depicted an or- 
ganization comprised of eight levels--with 
500 incumbents at the bottom and only 10 at 
the very top---began with an equal number 
of men and women awaiting promotion into 
one of the eight levels. Each person was 
assigned a performance evaluation score. The 
scores of men and women were distributed 
so as to be normal and identical (It = 50, s = 
10). Incumbents with the highest scores be- 
came eligible for promotion once a position 
was available. The simulation began by re- 
moving 15% of the incumbents. These posi- 
tions were filled from within the organiza- 
tion, with eligible individuals (those with the 
highest scores) being promoted into the po- 
sition. The simulation continued to apply 
the 15% attrition rule until the organization 
was staffed entirely with "new" employees. 
That is, all individuals within the organiza- 
tion at the start of the simulation had been 
replaced with individuals from the initial 
pool. For each simulation, 20 computer runs 
were conducted to ensure an adequate degree 
of reliability. 
To assess the impact of male-female 
differences, "bias points" were added to the 
performance score of each man. In Simula- 
tion 1, 4.58 bias points, accounting for 5% 
of the variance in scores, were added; in 
Simulation 2, 2.01 bias points, accounting 
for 1% of the variance, were added. Propor- 
tion of variance was calculated by convert- 
ing the standardized mean differences in per- 
formance scores between men and women 
into r 2. Given the standard deviation in the 
scores, the distributions of male and female 
scores were overlapping, even after the in- 
troduction of bias points. 
Detailed results are shown in Tables 1 
and 2; the main findings are highlighted in 
Figure 1. It can be seen that a very high 
percentage of upper-level positions were 
filled by men, whereas women tended to 
cluster at the lower levels of the organiza- 
tion. With 5% of the variance in ratings 
attributed to sex, only 29% of the incum- 
bents at the very top level of the organiza- 
tion were women, whereas 58% of the very 
bottom level positions were filled by women.

Even more dramatic is the finding that when 
sex differences explained but 1% of the vari- 
ance, an estimate that might be dismissed as 
trivial, only 35% of the highest-level posi- 
tions were filled by women. Thus, relatively 
small sex bias effects in performance ratings 
led to substantially lower promotion rates 
for women, resulting in proportionately 
fewer women than men at the top levels of 
the organization. 
These results confirm Eagly's (1995) 
point that the effects of male-female differ- 
ences are best determined not by the magni- 
tude of the effect but its consequences in 
natural settings. In this case, by taking into 
account the relative scarcity of very senior- 
level positions in organizations as well as 
the weight accorded early career performance 
ratings, a little bias hurt women a lot. We 
suggest, then, a salutary approach to assess- 
ing practical significance is not to reject tra- 
ditional effect size measures but to translate 
them into estimates of real world impact. 
Computer simulations are ideal for this.

Differences Between Women 
and Men: Their Magnitude, 
Practical Importance, and 
Political Meaning

The issue of the magnitude of differences 
between women and men continues to elicit 
diverse opinions, as the comments by Lott 
(1996) and Martell, Lane, and Emrich (1996) 
illustrate. Lott's (1996) view that "there is 
simply no getting around the fact that the 
differences so painstakingly identified are 
small indeed!" (p. 156) can be juxtaposed 
against Martell, Lane, and Emrich's insight- 
ful demonstration of the practical impor- 
tance of differences that Lott, along with 
most psychologists, would surely label as 
extremely small. Martell, Lane, and Emrich 
thus showed that a difference in perfor- 
mance evaluations favoring men but account- 
ing for only 1% of the variability in scores 
can produce an organizational structure in 
which only 35% of the highest level posi- 
tions are filled by women. Also dramatic 
was Abelson's (1985) earlier demonstration 
that baseball players' batting skills have a 
substantial impact on their teams' success, 
despite the fact that the percentage of vari- 
ance in any single batting performance that 
is explained by batting skill is approximately 
0.3%. These simple illustrations of the practi- 
cal importance of seemingly small effects 
thus underscore my point that psycholo- 
gists are generally misled when they address 
magnitude issues in terms of percentage of 
variance. 
In addition to translating research find- 
ings to more intuitively understandable 
metrics (e.g., the binomial effect-size dis- 
play and the common-language effect size), 
psychologists should follow the example of 
Martell, Lane, and Emrich by examining con- 
sequences of group differences in natural 
settings. Lott (1996) and 1 are in agreement 
about the importance of explaining differ- 
ences theoretically. As [ wrote, "Empirical 
findings take on meaning and importance 
within theories that explain the antecedents 
of the findings" (Eagly, 1995, p. 148). Puz- 
zlingly, Lott advocates the development of 
theories of difference but simultaneously 
opposes the identification of differences. In 
science, the identification of a phenomenon 
precedes explanation of it. As I argued (Eagly, 
1995, p. 148), the 1970s consensus among 
research psychologists that sex differences 
are null or very small discouraged theoretical 
attention to differences because weak, unre- 
liable effects seemed undeserving of theo- 
retical explanation. Therefore, as a first phase 
of scientific activity, cataloging differences 
and similarities is extremely useful. 
Research findings can be cataloged a 
manner that is more or less interesting, de- 
pending on whether reviewers attend to the 
context of the differences and their theoreti- 
cal meaning. As I noted (Eagly, 1995, pp. 
152-153), quantitative syntheses offer three 
excellent methods of investigating whether 
findings are context dependent: (a) the calcu- 
lation of a statistical index that expresses the 
degree of homogeneity versus heterogeneity 
of findings in a sample of studies, (b) the 
identification of outliers among a set of find- 
ings, and (c) the identification of moderator 
variables that account for variability in find- 
ings. Using these methods, many contempo- 
rary meta-analysts scrutinize variability 
among effect sizes and the contextual vari- 
ables that produce this variability. They 
also test theories using the data produced by 
their syntheses of research (see Miller & 
Pollock, 1994). 
As Archer (1996) cautioned, the con- 
text of research findings cannot be investi- 
gated in meta-analyses unless the relevant 
contextual feature has varied across the avail-
