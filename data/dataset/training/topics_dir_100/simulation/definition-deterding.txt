ABSTRACT 
Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market 
consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. 
Usually summarized as “gamification”, this trend connects to a 
sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-
computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, 
pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. 
However, it is not clear how “gamification” relates to these, 
whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. 
Thus, in this paper we investigate “gamification” and the 
historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar 
concepts. It is suggested that “gamified” applications provide 
insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful 
phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of 
“gamification” as the use of game design elements in non-game 
contexts.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Following the success of the location-based service Foursquare, 
the idea of using game design elements in non-game contexts to 
motivate and increase user activity and retention has rapidly 
gained traction in interaction design and digital marketing. Under 
the moniker “gamification”, this idea is spawning an intense 
public debate as well as numerous applications – ranging across 
productivity, finance, health, education, sustainability,  as well as 
news and entertainment media. Several vendors now offer 
“gamification” as a software service layer of reward and 
reputation systems with points, badges, levels and leader boards. 
This commercial deployment of ‘gamified’ applications to large 
audiences potentially promises new, interesting lines of inquiry 
and data sources for human-computer interaction (HCI) and game 
studies – and indeed, “gamification” is increasingly catching the 
attention of researchers [24,48,58]. 
However, until now, little academic attention has been paid to a 
definition of the concept of “gamification” (see [37] for one 
exception). There has also been no close scrutiny of whether the 
term actually denotes a sufficiently new and distinct phenomenon. 
Therefore, this paper surveys and situates current uses of 
“gamification” within existing research to suggest a definition of 
“gamification”. The first sections describe the origin and current 
uses of the term and compare these with historic precursors and 
parallels in HCI and game studies. This leads on to a definition of 
“gamification” and a discussion of its elements. It is argued that 
“gamification” calls attention to phenomena of “gamefulness”, 
which should be considered as complementary to but distinct from 
playfulness. The definition is situated in the fields of HCI and 
game studies, and the paper concludes by outlining the research 
contribution of studying “gamified” applications. 
2. INDUSTRY ORIGINS 
“Gamification” as a term originated in the digital media industry. 
The first documented use dates back to 2008 [54,55], but the term 
did not see widespread adoption before the second half of 2010. 
Parallel terms continue being used and new ones are still being 
introduced, such as “productivity games” [47], “surveillance 
entertainment” [32], “funware” [66], “playful design” [27], 
“behavioral games” [25], “game layer” [56] or “applied gaming” 
(natronbaxter.com). Yet “gamification” has arguably managed to 
institutionalize itself as the common household term. 
Despite or because of that, “gamification” is also a heavily 
contested term, especially within the game industry and the game 
studies community. Discontent with current implementations, 
oversimplifications, and interpretations have led some to coin 
different terms for their own arguably highly related practice. For 
instance, designer and researcher Jane McGonigal redefined 
“Alternate Reality Games” as “a game you play in your real life” 
([48], p. 120) to describe her work, and game scholar and designer 
Ian Bogost recommended replacing the term “gamification” with 
“exploitationware” [9] as an act of linguistic politics that would 
more truthfully portray the “villainous reign of abuse” that 
“gamification” presumably entails. 
Current industry uses of the term fluctuate between two related 
concepts. The first is the increasing adoption, institutionalization

and ubiquity of (video) games in everyday life [63,35,18]. The 
second, more specific notion is that since video games are 
designed with the primary purpose of entertainment, and since 
they can demonstrably motivate users to engage with them with 
unparalleled intensity and duration, game elements should be able 
to make other, non-game products and services more enjoyable 
and engaging as well [71,73].  
Vendors and consultants have tended to describe “gamification” 
practically and in terms of client benefits, for example as “the 
adoption of game technology and game design methods outside of 
the games industry” [35], “the process of using game thinking and 
game mechanics to solve problems and engage users” [70], or 
“integrating game dynamics into your site, service, community, 
content or campaign, in order to drive participation”.1 
3. PRECURSORS & PARALLELS 
These ideas are not entirely new. The notion that user interface 
design can be informed by other design practices has a rich 
tradition in HCI. During the first boom of computer games in the 
early 1980s, Malone wrote seminal papers deriving “heuristics for 
designing enjoyable user interfaces” from video games [46]. 
Carroll [16] analyzed the design of early text adventures such as 
Adventure, leading him and Thomas [14] to suggest redressing 
routine work activities in varying “metaphoric cover stories” to 
make them more intrinsically interesting, and to urge for a 
research program on fun and its relation to ease of use [15]. 
With the expansion and maturation of the field and the rise of user 
experience as a profession, more researchers began to study such 
“hedonic attributes” [34] or “motivational affordances” [69] of 
“pleasurable products” [40], dubbing the field “‘funology’ – the 
science of enjoyable technology” [8], again taking game design as 
an important source of inspiration. As part of this movement, 
some researchers have looked into “games with a purpose”, in 
which game play is piggybacked to solve human information 
tasks such as tagging images [2], and using game interfaces and 
controllers in other contexts [17]. More importantly, multiple 
researchers have explored playfulness as a desirable user 
experience or mode of interaction, and how to design for it. 
Despite this considerable body of research, no consensual theory 
or terminology of playfulness has emerged so far: Sometimes, it is 
equated broadly with any “pleasurable experience” [20] or “fun” 
[28], or indeed every interaction that goes beyond utilitarian work 
and task contexts [30,31,52]. To this end, Gaver introduced the 
terms “ludic design”, “ludic engagement” and “ludic activities”, 
broadly describing “activities motivated by curiosity, exploration, 
and reflection” [30]. Other studies focused and defined 
playfulness more narrowly [68,51,43]; Korhonen, Montola and 
Arrasvuori have made the most systematic attempt in this regard 
[43,44]. Combining the “pleasurable experience” framework of 
Costello and Edmonds [20] with further theoretical work and user 
studies on video game play, they developed a Playful Experience 
Framework (PLEX) that categorizes 22 (originally 20) playful 
experiences.  
Finally, in the 2000s, HCI researchers also became increasingly 
interested in studying the design and experience of video games in 
their own right, developing methods to evaluate their user 
experience [6], “playability” heuristics for their design [62], and 
models for the components of games [29,36] and game experience 
[13,53,65].

In the field of game studies, “gamification” can be seen as but one 
further outgrowth of the repurposing and extension of games 
beyond entertainment in the private home.  
Games used for serious purposes or “serious games” [1] date back 
several millennia [33], migrating from mainly military uses into 
education and business in the second half of the 20th century. In 
the early 2000s, the rise of digital games has reinvigorated this 
into a substantial industry and research field of its own. Such 
digital, serious games can be defined as “any form of interactive 
computer-based game software for one or multiple players to be 
used on any platform and that has been developed with the 
intention to be more than entertainment” ([59], p. 6). Within 
serious games, some authors have proposed differentiating 
between serious games and serious gaming [39]. Whereas the 
term “serious games” denotes games designed to convey learning 
material in being played through, “serious gaming” encompasses 
any (educational) utilization of the broader ecology of games – 
that is, all of the technologies, practices, literacies and social 
processes surrounding games, like reviewing games; producing 
machinima; or designing virtual items, avatars, levels, or whole 
games. 
In parallel to the serious games movement, new game genres 
evolved that stretched the traditional limits of games, bringing 
games into new contexts, situations and spaces. These are 
commonly called pervasive games, games that have “one or more 
salient features that expand the contractual magic circle of play 
spatially, temporally, or socially” ([50], p. 12). Examples are 
location-based games that take gameplay into the public space, 
augmented reality games that use digital devices to overlay game 
representations over the environment, persistent games that 
continually run to be entered and exited during the course of the 
day, or alternate reality games which “take the substance of 
everyday life and weave it into narratives that layer additional 
meaning, depth, and interaction upon the real world” ([50], p. 37). 
On the broadest scale, media scholars observe a “ludification of 
culture” [50,57]. With their increasing ubiquity, adoption and 
institutionalization in the past three decades, they argue that video 
games have become a cultural medium and source of formative 
experiences on a par with literature, movies, or television in 
earlier generations. Technologies, tropes, references and 
metaphors, mindsets and practices flowing from games 
increasingly suffuse society and everyday life, most notably 
playful identities and playful media practices. 
4. TOWARDS A DEFINITION 
This brief review shows that “gamification” has grown within a 
rich bed of interacting trends and traditions in interaction design 
and games, and that there are already a number of potentially 
competing, parallel, or overlapping concepts. Thus, if 
“gamification” is to be understood and developed as an academic 
term, the task is to determine whether the term and current 
“gamified” applications are significantly different from previous 
phenomena and areas of research – and if so, how to situate them 
in relation to these existing fields. 
We believe that “gamification” does indeed demarcate a distinct 
but previously unspecified group of phenomena, namely the 
complex of gamefulness, gameful interaction, and gameful design, 
which are different from the more established concepts of 
playfulness, playful interaction, or design for playfulness. Based 
on this observation, we propose the following definition: 
“Gamification” is the use of game design elements in non-game 
contexts. The following sections unpack this definition in detail. 
4.1 Game 
Firstly, “gamification” relates to games, not play (or playfulness), 
where “play” can be conceived of as the broader, looser category, 
containing but different from “games” [60].  In game studies, this 
distinction between games and play is usually tied back to 
Caillois’ concept of paidia and ludus as two poles of play 
activities [12]. Whereas paidia (or “playing”) denotes a more free-
form, expressive, improvisational, even “tumultuous” 
recombination of behaviors and meanings, ludus (or “gaming”) 
captures playing structured by rules and competitive strife toward 
goals. Along those lines, classic definitions in game studies state 
that gaming and games – in contrast to playing and toys – are 
characterized by explicit rule systems and the competition or strife 
of actors in those systems towards discrete goals or outcomes 
[42,60]. Recent theoretical and empirical studies have provided 
further support for the distinctness of “playing” and “gaming” as 
two modes, foci, or “values” of behavior and mindset2 
encountered during video game play [4,41]. This distinction also 
appears in HCI research on playfulness. The aforementioned 
PLEX framework acknowledges Caillois’ distinction of paidia 
and ludus in that it explicitly sets out to capture all experiences 
between these two poles [43]. Finally, academic as well as 
industry critiques of “gamified” applications have repeatedly 
emphasized that these focus almost exclusively on design 
elements for rule-bound, goal-oriented play (i.e., ludus), with little 
space for open, exploratory, free-form play (i.e., paidia) [3,23]. 
Indeed, this critique of mass-market “gamified” applications 
serves as a valuable observation from a research perspective: 
namely, that design inspired by games can afford experiences and 
behaviors leaning more to one pole of play than the other. These 
applications also provide us with empirical data on the design and 
experience of systems supporting the rule-bound or ludus pole, 
which has arguably received less research attention in HCI. 
On these grounds, in contrast to the PLEX framework that 
includes both free-form and rule-bound play under “playfulness”, 
we suggest adopting the term “gamefulness” recently introduced 
by McGonigal [48] as a systematic complement to “playfulness”. 
Where “playfulness” broadly denotes the experiential and 
behavioral qualities of playing (paidia), “gamefulness” denotes 
the qualities of gaming (ludus). Thus, gamefulness circumscribes 
a coherent set of phenomena that is both distinct and has received 
little focused attention so far, which provides a meaningful 
extensional ground for defining “gamification”. To systemize the 
terminology, one may distinguish 
• gamefulness (the experiential and behavioral quality),  
• gameful interaction (artifacts affording that quality), and  
• gameful design (designing for gamefulness, typically by using 
game design elements).  
In terms of defining “gamification”, this means that it too has to 
be analytically distinguished from playfulness or playful design – 
indeed, this marks the novelty of “gamified” applications. In 
practice, it can be assumed that they often can and will give rise to 
playful behaviors and mindsets as well, just as video game players 
often switch between playful and gameful behaviors and mindsets 
during play [4]. “Gamification” will usually coincide with 
                                                                  
2 There is some consensus that playfulness should be construed as an 
attitude or mindset with which one approaches a given activity, rather than 
a distinct set of observable behaviors. However, several scholars also point 
out that although that is the case, there are still certain observable formal 
properties of activities when they are playfully approached [11,22,45]. To 
capture this, we speak of “behavior and mindset” here. 
gameful design as defined above: The most likely strategy of 
designing for gameful experiences is to use game design elements, 
and the most likely goal of using game design elements are 
gameful experiences. Yet analytically, gameful design and 
“gamification” frame the same extension of phenomena through 
different intensional properties – as the design strategy of using 
game design elements (gamification) or the design goal of 
designing for gamefulness (gameful design).  
Although the overwhelming majority of current examples of 
“gamification” are digital, the term should not be limited to digital 
technology. Not only are media convergence and ubiquitous 
computing increasingly blurring the distinction between digital 
and non-digital: games and game design are themselves 
transmedial categories [42].  
4.2 Element 
Whereas “serious game” describes the design of full-fledged 
games for non-entertainment purposes, “gamified” applications 
merely incorporate elements of games (or game “atoms” [10]). Of 
course, the boundary between “game” and “artifact with game 
elements” can often be blurry – is Foursquare a game or a 
“gamified” application? To complicate matters, this boundary is 
empirical, subjective and social: Whether you and your friends 
‘play’ or ‘use’ Foursquare depends on your (negotiated) focus, 
perceptions and enactments. The addition of one informal rule or 
shared goal by a group of users may turn a ‘merely’ “gamified” 
application into a ‘full’ game. Within game studies, there is an 
increasing acknowledgement that any definition of “games” has to 
go beyond properties of the game artifact to include these situated, 
socially constructed meanings [19,67]. For the present purpose, 
this means that (a) artifactual as well as social elements of games 
need to be considered, and (b) artifactual elements should be 
conceived more in terms of affording gameful interpretations and 
enactments, rather than being gameful. Indeed, the characteristic 
of “gamified” applications might be that compared to games, they 
afford a more fragile, unstable ‘flicker’ of experiences and 
enactments between playful, gameful, and other, more 
instrumental-functionalist modes. 
This leads directly to another question: Which elements belong 
into the set of ‘game elements’? Take the “Ten Ingredients of 
Great Games” identified by Reeves and Read [58]: Self-
representation with avatars; three-dimensional environments; 
narrative context; feedback; reputations, ranks, and levels; 
marketplaces and economies; competition under rules that are 
explicit and enforced; teams; parallel communication systems that 
can be easily configured; time pressure. Each of these elements 
can be found outside of games, and taken in isolation, none of 
them would be readily identified as ‘gameful’, let alone game-
specific. Also, there is serious variation between the different 
game genres and digital versus non-digital games – avatars are 
common in action and roleplaying games, but not necessarily in 
strategy video games or card games. In addition, how game 
elements are perceived can also be a matter of role, whether this 
be designer or user. For example, the MDA model [36] suggests 
that designers work with mechanics to create aesthetics, whereas 
players experience aesthetics, and in so doing, infer knowledge 
about mechanics. 
This points to the fact that “game” is a composite category of 
multiple necessary conditions. Take the “classic game model” by 
Juul [42]: “A game is a rule-based formal system with a variable 
and quantifiable outcome, where different outcomes are assigned 
different values, the player exerts effort in order to influence the 
outcome, the player feels attached to the outcome, and the 
consequences of the activity are optional and negotiable.” As Juul 
himself argues, no part of this definition on its own constitutes a 
game. Only together do they set apart a clear figure against the 
background of other phenomena. 
Yet as helpful as this may be for defining games, it does not 
answer the question of how to identify game elements. One 
solution is to treat game elements as a set of building blocks or 
features shared by games (rather than a set of necessary conditions 
for a game), comparable to Wittgensteinian family resemblances. 
A very strict interpretation of this approach – accepting only 
elements that are unique or specific to games – would produce an 
empty or very constrained set. A very liberal interpretation – any 
element that can be found in any game – would be boundless. We 
therefore suggest restricting “gamification” to the description of 
elements that are characteristic to games – elements that are 
found in most (but not necessarily all) games, readily associated 
with games, and found to play a significant role in gameplay. Of 
course, this is a heuristic definition with much room for debate 
over what is “characteristic” for games. 
4.3 Design 
As noted, “gamified” applications are not the only instances 
where elements of games have been repurposed. In HCI, there is a 
long tradition of using game controllers as input devices for other 
purposes. Graphic engines and authoring tools of video games are 
also regularly used for non-entertainment purposes (from 
scientific visualizations and 3D environments to fan art), as are 
practices of the broader game ecology, e.g. in serious gaming. For 
the purposes of terminological and conceptual clarity, it is more 
helpful to reserve the term “gamification” for the use of game 
design, not game-based technologies or practices of the wider 
game ecology. 
When surveying the existing literature on games and 
“gamification”, we found that such game design elements were 
identified on varying levels of abstraction. All of these levels 
should be included in the definition. Ordered from concrete to 
abstract, five levels can be distinguished (tab. 1): Interface design 
patterns [21]; game design patterns [7] or game mechanics [67]; 
design principles, heuristics or ‘lenses’ [62]; conceptual models of 
game design units [10,13,29,36]; game design methods and design 
processes [5,29]. 
As can be seen, this ‘level model’ distinguishes interface design 
patterns from game design patterns or game mechanics. Although 
they relate to the shared concept of pattern languages [26], unlike 
interface design patterns, neither game mechanics nor game 
design patterns refer to (prototypical) implemented solutions; both 
can be implemented with many different interface elements. 
Therefore, they are more abstract and thus treated as distinct.  
So to restate, whereas serious games fulfill all necessary and 
sufficient conditions for being a game, “gamified” applications 
merely use several design elements from games. Seen from the 
perspective of the designer, what distinguishes “gamification” 
from ‘regular’ entertainment games and serious games is that they 
are built with the intention of a system that includes elements 
from games, not a full ‘game proper’. From the user perspective, 
such systems entailing design elements from games can then be 
enacted and experienced as ‘games proper’, gameful, playful, or 
otherwise – this instability or openness is what sets them apart 
from ‘games proper’ for users.

4.4 Non-game contexts 
Similar to serious games, “gamification” uses elements of games 
for purposes other than their normal expected use as part of an 
entertainment game. Now ‘normal use’ is a socially, historically 
and culturally contingent category. However, it is reasonable to 
assume that entertainment currently constitutes the prevalent 
expected use of games. Likewise, joy of use, engagement, or more 
generally speaking, improvement of the user experience represent 
the currently predominant use cases of “gamification” (in the 
definition proposed in this paper, gameful experiences are the 
most likely design goal). Still, we explicitly suggest not delimiting 
“gamification” to specific usage contexts, purposes, or scenarios. 
Firstly, there are no clear advantages in doing so. Secondly, the 
murkiness of the discourse on “serious games” can be directly 
linked to the fact that some authors initially tied the term to the 
specific context and goal of education and learning, whereas 
serious games proliferated into all kinds of contexts [61]. Thus, in 
parallel to Sawyer’s taxonomy of serious games [61], we consider 
different usage contexts or purposes as potential subcategories: 
Just as there are training games, health games, or newsgames, 
there can be gameful design or “gamification” for training, for 
health, for news, and for other application areas. 
Some authors have argued that games themselves can be 
‘gamified’ [72], a case in point being meta-game platforms such 
as achievement systems [38,49]. In principle, this might be in line 
with the definition presented here – the only thing that “non-
gaming contexts” explicitly intend to exclude is the use of game 
design elements as part of designing a game, since that would 
simply be game design, not “gamification”. However, on closer 
scrutiny, classifying meta-games or other additions of game 
design to existing games as something other than game design 
becomes hard to uphold: Firstly, even in formalist game literature, 
meta-games are also understood as full-fledged games, “based on 
the effects and outcomes of other games” ([7], p. 401), not simply 
game design elements. Secondly, from the designer’s perspective, 
given that the context of design is already that of games, it seems 
counter-productive to perceive the design of meta-games (or game 
elements) as distinct from the design of those games. Thirdly, 
shifting our focus to the user’s perspective, it is a complex and 
open empirical question whether (or under what circumstances) 
players experience meta-game elements as part of or distinct from 
the “primary game”. And in all cases where a meta-game system 
is not experienced as distinct from the “primary” game, it appears 
unnecessary to create an artificial separation between the two. 
Finally, we have argued that part of the novelty and distinctness of 
“gamified” systems is the experiential ‘flicker’ between gameful, 
playful, and other modes of experience and engagement. Such 
flickers are arguably less likely to occur when the user is already 
playing a game. Classifying meta-games as “gamification” does 
not acknowledge this difference, but we readily admit that this 
constitutes a complex case that warrants further empirical 
research.  
5. SITUATING “GAMIFICATION” 
To summarize: “Gamification” refers to 
• the use (rather than the extension) of 
• design (rather than game-based technology or other game-
related practices) 
• elements (rather than full-fledged games) 
• characteristic for games (rather than play or playfulness) 
• in non-game contexts (regardless of specific usage intentions, 
contexts, or media of implementation). 
This definition contrasts “gamification” against other related 
concepts via the two dimensions of playing/gaming and 
parts/whole. Both games and serious games can be differentiated 
from “gamification” through the parts/whole dimension. Playful 
design and toys can be differentiated through the playing/gaming 
dimension (Figure 1). In the broader scheme of trends and 
concepts identified as related, we find “gamification” or gameful 
design situated as follows: Within the socio-cultural trend of 
ludification, there are at least three trajectories relating to video 
games and HCI: the extension of games (pervasive games), the 
use of games in non-game contexts, and playful interaction. The 
use of games in non-game contexts falls into full-fledged games 
(serious games) and game elements, which can be further 
differentiated into game technology, game practices, and game 
design. The latter refers to “gamification” (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To date, there appears to have been only one alternative attempt to 
define “gamification” in academic literature. Huotari and Hamari 
have suggested defining “gamification” from a service-marketing 
perspective as a “service packaging where a core service is 
enhanced by a rules-based service system that provides feedback 
and interaction mechanisms to the user with an aim to facilitate 
and support the users’ overall value creation.” [37] 
Huotari and Hamari’s definition differs from our own in several 
ways. Firstly, by focusing on rules-based systems, it arguably 
covers more than games or ‘gamified’ services and is ultimately 
applicable to almost any interactive system. Even a touchpad for 
ordering snacks in a cinema would qualify as a “rules-based 
service system” (driven by software) “that provides feedback and 
interaction mechanisms” (people order through the interface, 
which confirms their orders) “with an aim to facilitate and support 
the users’ overall value creation” (the ability to order snacks 
enhances the movie experience). 
Secondly, focusing on rules-based systems and situating the 
definition within a service marketing perspective underplay the 
constitutive social and experiential dimensions of games. 
Thirdly, the definition excludes all systems where the provision of 
game mechanics (tailored to a specific context) is the core service 
itself, or at least an essential part of it: What most ‘gamified’ 
health applications such as Health Month (healthmonth.com) offer 
is the ability to set up rules and goals for personal health behavior, 
to then track actual behavior against them – these game elements 
are not a deductable “enhancement” of another “core” service. In 
contrast, we believe that our definition addresses all these issues. 
6. CONCLUSION 
This paper argued that current “gamified” applications present 
emerging phenomena that warrant new concepts and research. 
Specifically, it suggested that insight into “gamefulness” as a 
complement to “playfulness” – in terms of design goals as well as 
user behaviors and experiences – marks a valuable and lasting 
contribution of studying “gamified” systems. Partly in reaction to 
this, the term “gameful design” – design for gameful experiences 
– was also introduced as a potential alternative to “gamification”. 
Given the industry origins, charged connotations and debates 
Figure 1. “Gamification” between game and play, whole and parts 
Figure 2. Situating “gamification” in the larger field 
about the practice and design of “gamification”, “gameful design” 
currently provides a new term with less baggage, and therefore a 
preferable term for academic discourse. 
Another important point is the high level of subjectivity and 
contextuality in identifying “gamification”. It is not possible to 
determine whether a given empirical system ‘is’ “a gamified 
application” or “a game” without taking recourse to either the 
designers’ intentions or the user experiences and enactments. 
Indeed, in comparison to games on the one hand and utility 
software on the other, a distinct quality of “gamified” applications 
is their relative openness to varying situational modes of 
engagement – gameful, playful, and instrumental.  
To conclude, one of the big promises of today’s commercial 
deployments of “gamified” systems is easy access to more 
ecologically valid user data on the different kinds of experiences 
and natural categories that arise from interaction with these 
systems. This data will ultimately determine the validity of the 
distinctions introduced here. Even if they do not remain upheld in 
the long term, we believe that our suggested definitions of 
“gamification” and “gamefulness” against serious games and 
playful interaction clarifies discourse and thus allows research to 
move into more detailed study, and clearer conceptualization of 
the defined phenomena.
