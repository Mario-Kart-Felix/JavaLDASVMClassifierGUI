Introductory Remarks
• Cognitive Radio is growing in leaps and
bounds, both in depth and breadth, all
over the world.
• The question is: Why this surge of interest
in a topic so relatively new?
• The answer is:
(i) It solves a pressing need: Underutiliza-
tion of a precious natural resource:
The Radio Spectrum.
(ii) Cognitive radio is challenging in ways
few, if any, other wireless technologies
are today.RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 4
Introductory Remarks (continued)
• It is not just cognitive radio that is attract-
ing the attention of researchers all over
the world. Rather, it is:
Cognitive Multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless
Cognitive Radar
Cognitive Car
Cognitive Information Processing
Cognitive Computation
Cognitive Optimization
• What I am leading up to is the new discipline:
“Cognitive Dynamic Systems”

Point-of-View Article, Proc. IEEE,
Nov. 2006.
I see the emergence of a new discipline, called
Cognitive Dynamic Systems1, which builds on
ideas in statistical signal processing, stochastic
control, and information theory, and weaves those
well-developed ideas into new ones drawn from
neuroscience, statistical learning theory, and
game theory. The discipline will provide
principled tools for the design and development of
a new generation of wireless dynamic systems
exemplified by cognitive radio and cognitive radar
with efficiency, effectiveness, and robustness as
the hallmarks of performance.

• to perceive the world;
• to learn, to remember, and to control actions;
• to think and create new ideas;
• to control communication with others;
• to create the experience of feelings, intentions,
  and self-awareness.
Johnson-Laird, a prominent psychologist and linguist,
went on to argue that theories of the mind should be
modelled in computational terms.RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 8
2. Motivation Behind
Cognitive Radio
• Significant underutilization of the radio
spectrum
• The Cognitive Radio solution to the
spectrum underutilization problem:
(i) Sense the radio environment to detect
spectrum holes (i.e., underutilized sub-
bands of the radio spectrum).
(ii) Make the spectrum holes available for
employment by secondary users
efficiently, subject to the constraint
that the received power in each
spectrum hole does not exceed a pre-
scribed limit (set by the legacy user).RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 9

Cognitive Radio Defined
The cognitive radio network is a complex multiuser wireless
communication system capable of emergent behaviour.
It embodies the following functions:
• to perceive the radio environment (i.e., outside world) by
empowering each user’s receiver to sense the
environment on a continuous-time basis;
• to learn from the environment and adapt the
performance of each transceiver (transmitter-receiver)
to statistical variations in the incoming RF stimuli;
• to facilitate communication between multiple users
through cooperation in a self-organized manner;
• to control the communication processes among
competing users through the proper allocation of
available resources;
• to create the experience of intention and self-awareness.
Primary objectives:
1. To provide highly reliable communication for all users of
the network.
2. To facilitate efficient utilization of the radio spectrum in a
fair-minded way.RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 11
4. Major Functional Blocks
of Cognitive Radio
Function Objective
1. Spectrum
    sensing
Detection of spectrum holes and
estimation of their average power
contents.
2. Predictive
    modeling
Prediction of how long the spectrum
hole is likely to remain available for
employment by secondary user.
3. Transmit-
    power
    control
Maximize the data rate of each user
subject to power constraints
4. Dynamic
    spectrum
    management
Distribute the spectrum holes fairly
among secondary users, bearing in
mind usage costs.

routing of packets across the radio

6. Cognitive Hand-held
Wireless Devices
(i)  Exploiting ideas rooted in cognitive information
processing is not confined to cognitive radio,
cognitive radar; couple of applications currently
attracting a great deal of attention.
(ii) As a matter of interest in the course of preparing
my lecture notes for the visit to RIM, I believe
that I have discovered a novel way of making any
hand-held wireless device cognitive.
(iii) I think I know how to make the blackberry into a
cognitive device, and am currently in the process
of filing a patent on it.RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 15
Concluding Remarks
• The Study of Cognitive Dynamic Systems will be one of the
most influential scientific endeavours in the 21st century:
The Computer is the Driving Force
• Cognitive Radio is already being considered as the candidate
for the 5th Generation of Wireless Communications.
• Under the umbrella of Cognitive Dynamic Systems, what I
have been working on for much of my professional career,
namely,
Signal Processing
Communication Theory
Control Theory
Radar Systems
Neural Networks and Learning Machines
has come into focus for the first time.RIM_Haykin_July 24, 2008 16
