Background/Aims: Oligofructose and inulin are natu- 
rally occurring indigestible carbohydrates. In vitro they 
selectively stimulate the growth of species of Bifido- 
bacterium, a genus of bacteria considered beneficial 
to health. This study was designed to determine their 
effects on the large bowel microflora and colonic func- 
tion in vivo. Methods: Eight subjects participated in a 
45-day study during which they ate controlled diets. 
For the middle 15 days, 15 g. day -1 oligofructose was 
substituted for 15 g. day -1 sucrose. Four of these sub- 
jects went on to a further period with 15 g. day -z inulin. 
Bowel habit, transit time, stool composition, breath H2 
and CH4, and the predominant genera of colonic bacte- 
ria were measured. Results: Both oligofructose and inu- 
lin significantly increased bifidobacteria from 8.8 to 9.5 
Iog~o g stool -1 and 9.2 to 10.1 Ioglo g stool -~, respec- 
tively, whereas bacteroides, clostridia, and fusobac- 
teria decreased when subjects were fed oligofructose, 
and gram-positive cocci decreased when subjects were 
fed inulin. Total bacterial counts were unchanged. Fe- 
cal wet and dry matter, nitrogen, and energy excretion 
increased with both substrates, as did breath H2. Little 
change in fecal short-chain fatty acids and breath CH 4 
was observed. Conclusions: A 15-g- day -1 dietary addi- 
tion of oligofructose or inulin led to Bifidobacterium 
becoming the numerically predominant genus in feces. 
Thus, small changes in diet can alter the balance of 
colonic bacteria towards a potentially healthier mi- 
croflora. 
T he human large intestine contains a substantial and diverse population of bacteria that is important to 
human health. This predominantly anaerobic microflora 
is able to salvage energy for the host through the bacterial 
fermentation of undigested carbohydrates and protein to 
short-chain fatty acids, 1 which are then absorbed. The 
gut microbiota may also synthesize vitamins, 2 protect 
against invasive species that are often pathogenic, 3'4 and 
possibly contribute to the economy of essential amino 
acids in humans. 5'6 However, not all intestinal bacteria 
are beneficial to health, and a long-established concept is 
that of beneficial and harmful species] Beneficial genera 
include Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, both of which 
are saccharolytic, whereas species such as Clostridium per- 
fringens and Escherichia coli are considered detrimental, s'9 
Bifidobacteria are the numerically predominant bacte- 
rial genus in the feces of breast-fed infants. It is believed 
that this may contribute to the protection that breast 
feeding provides against gut infections. 1°-12 Most adults 
also carry bifidobacteria in their colons 12'13 but in lower 
numbers than in breast-fed infants. Because of their po- 
tentially beneficial properties, there have been attempts 
to increase their relative proportion in the adult colon. 
One method has been the feeding of probiotic microor- 
ganisms to introduce more bifidobacteria into the bowel. 
Bifidobacteria administered in this way are able to pass 
through the terminal ileum 14 and are detected in feces 
at about 10 8.8 g-~.15 However, they rapidly disappear 
from feces when oral dosing ceases. 
When administered by mouth, bifidobacteria can alter 
fecal bacterial enzyme activities, 16 reduce antibiotic- 
induced side effects, 17 inhibit 2-amino-3-methylim- 
idazo[4,5-f] quinoline-induced mammary and liver 
tumors in rats, ~8 and reduce 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in- 
duced colonic carcinogenesis in mice in conjunction with 
oligofructose) 9 They may be partly responsible for colo- 
nization resistance, which the resident microflora offers 
against invading pathogens, 2°'2~ and bifidobacteria stim- 
ulate the immune system towards certain tumors 22'23 and 
bacterial invasion. 21'24 
What  controls the growth of bifidobacteria in the gut? 
In breast milk, the "bifidus factor" is a glycoprotein 
containing glucose, galactose, fucose, and N-acetyl glu- 
cosamine) 2 In uncontrolled studies of elderly people 
administered 8 g" day -~ of a fructooligosaccharide (Neo- 
sugar; Meija Seika, Tokyo, Japan), bifidobacterial num- 
bers increased in feces, as did total anaerobes. 2%26 Using 
in vitro cultures of human fecal bacteria, we have shown 
that two structurally similar carbohydrates, oligofructose 
(OF) and inulin, selectively stimulate bifidobacterial 
growth while maintaining potential pathogens such as

E. coli and clostridia at low levels. 27 Moreover, in defined 
coculture experiments, various species of  bifidobacteria 
inhibited the g rowth  of  E. coli and C. perfringens. This 
effect was caused by the secretion of  an inhibi tory sub- 
stance that  was independent  of  changes in the culture 
pH.  Plating experiments showed that  this antimicrobial  
substance variably suppressed species belonging to the 
genera Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter, and Shigella, as 
well as Vibrio cholerae. 2s 
To determine whether  the addit ion of  OF or inulin to 
a normal diet  can lead to changes in the gu t  microflora, 
we fed these carbohydrates for 15 days to 8 healthy volun- 
teers under  controlled dietary conditions, subst i tut ing 
them for 15 g"  day-* sucrose in the basal diet. The effect 
of  this dietary change on the major  genera of  fecal bacte- 
ria and the colonic function, including stool ou tpu t  and 
composi t ion and breath H2 and CH4,  was measured. 
Mater ia ls  and Methods 
Subjects 
Eight healthy volunteers (7 men and 1 woman) with 
a mean age of 33.6 years (range, 2 1 - 4 8  years) and a mean 
body mass index of 22.4 (range, 18.7-25.4) were used in the 
study. All subjects underwent a medical examination, were 
healthy, and had not taken antibiotics for at least 3 months 
before the commencement of the study. Written consent was 
obtained from each person, and the protocol was approved by 
the Medical Research Council Dunn Nutrition Ethical Com- 
mittee. As part of the initial assessment, a stool sample was 
collected from the volunteers for bacteriological analyses. All 
had an initial viable count of bifidobacteria in the range of 
108-109 g wet wt feces -1. 
Oligofructose and Inulin 
Oligofructose was the oligosaccharide fraction of Rafti- 
lose (Orafti, Tienen, Belgium). It is composed of molecules of 
the GFn and Fn type [G, glucose; F, fructose; n, number of 
fructose moieties linked by ~ (2,1) linkages in a ratio of about 
2:1], with n being between 2 and 6, with an average degree 
of polymerization of 4. Inulin was the oligosaccharide fraction 
of Raftiline (Orafti), which was obtained by the extraction of 
chicory roots. It is composed of molecules of the GFn type, 
with n ranging from 2 to 60 and an average degree of polymer- 
ization of 10. 
Diet and Experimental Design 
The study was conducted using controlled diets with 
each subject fed for 15 days. The protocol included an initial 
few days to settle into the Unit's routine on a free diet and 
then 45 days that were divided into 15 days of initial control, 
15 days when 15 g ' d a y  -1 sucrose was replaced with 15 
g" day -1 OF, and finally 15 days of a second control period 
(15 g ' d a y  -1 sucrose). This was then followed by 5 days on a 
free diet for stool collections to complete fecal marker recover- 
ies. Four of the subjects went on to participate in another 25- 
day study, comprising the same control sucrose diet for 10 
days, with 15 g ' d a y  -1 sucrose being substituted by 15 
g" day -1 inulin during a further 15 days, and again followed 
by 5 days of stool collections to recover all markers. Subjects 
lived in the metabolic suite of the Medical Research Council 
Dunn Clinical Nutrition Centre. No food other than the diets 
provided or any alcohol were allowed. Subjects' normal energy 
requirements were assessed before the study from height, 
weight, and food records. The diets were weight maintaining. 
Three 1-day menus comprising normal foods were designed 
and fed in rotation to the subjects throughout the study. The 
basal diet provided 9 MJ energy and had the following compo- 
sition29: protein, 63 g; fat, 93 g (polyunsaturated/saturated fat 
ratio, 0.19); starch, 142 g (resistant starch, 4.7 g30); sugars, 
124 g; and nonstarch polysaccharides, 16.4 g.31 Energy intakes 
were adjusted to meet individual needs by adding 1-MJ incre- 
ments of the same composition as the basal diet to that diet. 
Energy intakes ranged from 9 to 15 MJ" day -1. Five grams of 
sucrose, OF, and inulin were administered with breakfast in a 
free form, and the other 10 g was incorporated into biscuits. 
Volunteers kept a daily diary in which to record their weight, 
times of radiopaque markers taken, stools passed, and any 
unusual events such as diarrhea and flatulence. 
Collection and Analysis of Breath 
End expiratory breath samples were collected in dupli- 
cate using a dedicated sampling device 32 together with a room 
air sample at 7 i'M and 10 PM on days 10, 13, and 15 of 
each experimental period, except for during the control sucrose 
period before inulin, when breath samples were collected on 
days 8 and 10. Hydrogen was measured using an exhaled 
hydrogen monitor (GMI, Renfrew, Scotland) that was adjusted 
to detect to 0.1 ppm and was calibrated daily using a 52- 
ppm standard. Methane was measured using a Pye 104 gas 
chromatograph 32 (Pye Unicam; Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, 
England) that was calibrated with 4.8- and 48-ppm CH4 stan- 
dards. Breath CH4 was reported as the concentration in the 
sample less that in room air. All samples were analyzed within 
24 hours of collection and corrected for H2 losses during stor- 
age using previously obtained correction factors for the syrin- 
ges. 
Stool Collection and Estimation of 
Intestinal Transit Time and Balance 
Markers 
All stools passed were collected and, apart from those 
required for bacteriologic analyses, were immediately weighed 
and frozen at -20°C.  During the last 6 days of each dietary 
period, three small subsamples of well-mixed stool were ob- 
tained within 1 hour of defecation for immediate bacteriologic 
analyses, and another sample was frozen for short chain fatty 
acid measurements. Mean transit time was measured using 
the continuous marker method) 3 Volunteers were given 10 
radiopaque shapes with each meal (30 per day), and marker 
type was changed every 15 days with diet. All stools were x-

rayed before any sampling, and the markers in each stool were 
counted. The mean transit time was calculated, and marker 
excretion was used to correct stool weights, nitrogen, energy, 
and ash outputs so that results represented a complete 5-day 
collection period. 34 
Diet and Fecal Analysis 
All stools from the last 5 days of each dietary period 
were pooled, weighed, and lyophilized to constant weight. The 
resultant dry sample was milled in a centrifugal mill and 
used for fecal analyses. Total nitrogen was measured using an 
automated Kjeldahl procedure, energy was determined by an 
adiabatic bomb calorimeter, and ash was quantified at 500°C 
after an initial burning off of organic residues over a flame. 
Fecal subsamples for short-chain fatty acid analysis were de- 
frosted at 4°C, mixed, and 1 g was diluted to 10 mL and 
centrifuged. One milliliter of the supernatant was then acidi- 
fied and extracted into diethyl ether over ice, 35 along with 
three calibration standards. 2-Methyl-valerate was used as an 
internal standard. The ether was dried with fused calcium 
chloride, and 0.5 ~L ether was injected onto a Pye 204 gas 
liquid chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector 
and a 25-m BP21-fused silica capillary column (inside diame- 
ter, 0.53 mm) (S.G.E. Australia, Ringwood, Victoria, Austra- 
lia). The column was held at 100°C with helium as the carrier 
gas at 11 psi of inlet pressure. There was linearity of extraction 
and recovery for all short-chain fatty acid analysis. All samples 
were analyzed in duplicate. 
Bacterial Enumeration and Identification 
All bacteriologic analyses of feces were performed 
within 1 hour of defecation. Five grams of fresh stool was 
homogenized using 50 mL of anaerobic 0.1 mol/L sodium 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to provide a 10% (wt/vol) fecal 
slurry. The slurry was sieved (aperture 250 btm), and 1 mL 
was diluted serially in half-strength Wilkins Chalgren anaero- 
bic broth (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) in an 
anaerobic cabinet (H2/CO2/N2, 10:10:80). Plates were inocu- 
lated in triplicate using selective media for the enumeration 
of total anaerobes, total aerobes, coliforms, gram-positive cocci, 
bifidobacteria, bacteroides, fusobacteria, lactobacilli, and clos- 
tridia, and plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically 
as appropriate. 35-39 
After incubation, individual colonies were removed from 
the media plates and subcultured into peptone yeast glucose 
(PYG) broth. 35 Bacteria were then characterized to genus level 
on the basis of colonial appearance, gram reaction, spore pro- 
duction, cell morphology, and fermentation end-product for- 
mation. Bifidobacteria were further identified by the produc- 
tion of acetate and lactate in PYG broth and a positive 
detection of fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity in 
crude cell extracts. 39 
Statistical Analyses 
Systat version 5.2.1 was used for all statistical analyses.

fatty acids results were analyzed by analysis of variance (AN-

teriologic results, the normality of a representative set of data 
was checked by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Bac- 
terial counts were logarithmized to fit a normal distribution, 
and the normality of the data was confirmed by Box and 
Whisker plots of the logged counts. ANOVA was used to 
show the effect of the diet on bacteriologic analyses. To confirm 
unequivocally statistical results of the bacterial count data, the 
analysis was repeated by means of the nonparametric Kruskal- 
Wallis test, which does not assume normality of the distribu- 
tion. Bacteriologic results are presented as mean values (SD). 
Resul ts  
All 8 subjects completed the controlled diet study 
wi thout  any periods of  ill health or abnormal bowel habit  
and maintained their weight.  One subject complained of

of  flatulence and abdominal  pain dur ing the OF feeding 
period.

able CH 4 in breath during the study period, and these 
subjects showed no obvious relationship between OF in- 
take and breath CH4 concentration (Figure 1) (23.5 --- 
6.2 ppm and 35.4 + 10.1 ppm for sucrose 1 and 2, 
respectively; 36.2 + 10.7 ppm for OF). 
When subjects were fed inulin, a similar significant 
increase in breath Hi  was observed (from 23.4 --- 3.11 
ppm to 41.5 + 6.94 ppm; P = 0.031). Of the 4 subjects 
who received inulin, 3 were methanogenic, and breath 
CH 4 increased in 2 of these 3 but decreased in the third, 
resulting in an increase, which was not significant in 
mean breath CH4, from 18.0 -+- 7.22 ppm to 27.7 + 
6.72 ppm. 
Bowel Habit,  Stool Composit ion,  and 
Digestibil ity 
Both OF and inulin increased stool frequency, the 
excretion of wet and dry matter, nitrogen, and energy 
(Tables 1 and 2), with increases in wet matter and nitro- 
gen excretion being significant when subjects were fed 
OF. Moisture content was unaffected, and there was an 
increase in transit time that was not significant through- 
out all diet periods, suggesting a slight underlying con- 
stipating effect of the basal diet. Ash excretion also in- 
creased when subjects were fed inulin, although changes 
were not significant. When considering only the results 
from the 4 subjects who participated in both OF and 
inulin diet periods (Table 2), the inclusion of inulin 
resulted in a larger increase in fecal wet and dry weight 
than did OF (34% and 23% vs. 14% and 12%); however, 
it also slowed mean transit time more than OF did. 
All measured components of the diet were highly di- 
gestible (Table 1), and the inclusion of OF had very little 
effect on apparent digestibility, except a very small but 
significant decrease in apparent nitrogen digestibility 
compared with both the sucrose diet periods (P < 0.05). 
Total short-chain fatty acids in feces (Table 3) averaged 
between 111 and 131 m m o l ' k g  -1 for each dietary pe-

acid concentrations during any of the dietary periods, 
except for a minor decrease in caproate during the second 
sucrose period (P = 0.008). Similarly, molar ratios (Table 
3) were unaltered, again with the exception of caproate 
(P = O.OO2). 
Stool Bacteriology 
The addition of both OF and inulin had little 
effect on total viable counts of aerobes or anaerobes. How- 
ever, for both carbohydrates, bifidobacterial counts (Table 
4) were significantly higher than during the sucrose peri- 
ods (P < 0.01). This increase was observed in 7 of the 
8 volunteers when they were fed OF and all 4 subjects 
who were fed inulin. Numbers of bifidobacteria declined 
significantly (P < 0.01) when OF was withdrawn, show- 
ing that the increase was directly attributable to the 
addition of OF to the diet and not to some underlying 
change in the microflora from becoming a resident at 
the Dunn Clinical Nutrition Centre on a controlled diet. 
A significant decrease in counts of bacteroides (P < 
0.01) was observed during the OF diet period with the 
result that bifidobacteria became the numerically pre- 
dominant species in 7 of the 8 volunteers. Although 
bacteroides numbers did not change when subjects were 
fed inulin, bifidobacteria still became the predominant 
species in 3 of the 4 volunteers. 
Clostridia and fusobacteria both declined significantly 
when subjects were fed OF (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). 
In most of the volunteers, subsequent ingestion of sucrose 
was required for a relatively long period (>  13 days) for 
counts of fusobacteria to recover to levels detected during 
the initial control period. Thus, viable counts in the 
second sucrose period were significantly lower (P < 0.05) 
than those recorded in the first sucrose period (Table 4). 
Counts of fusobacteria and clostridia were unchanged by 
the addition of inulin, although counts of gram-positive 
cocci decreased significantly (P < 0.001). In all the vol- 
unteers, numbers of lactobacilli were not affected by OF, 
but inulin increased lactobacilli counts, although not 
significantly (P = 0.075). Counts of coliforms were unaf- 
fected by any dietary addition (Table 4).

drates, it has proved experimentally difficult to produce 
consistent changes by dietary manipulation. The colon 
seems to be a self-regulating environment. The advent 
of "dietary fiber" approximately 20 years ago led to a 
number of studies that aimed to show beneficial effects 
on the microflora, but most failed to show any significant 
change. 4°'4. Some alterations in fecal bacterial enzyme 
activity have been noted 42'43 but no consistent changes 
in bacterial numbers. Similar findings emerge from stud- 
ies of m e a t  44 and fa t  45 o n  the microflora. An increase in 
overall numbers of bacteria in the colon with additional 
fermentable carbohydrate in the diet is apparent from 
studies of fecal biomass excretion, 46 but the balance of 
groups seems difficult to change by dietary means alone. 
Although specific effects of diet on the microflora are 
rarely observed, we have recently shown that the growth 
of sulfate-reducing bacteria could be stimulated by add- 
ing sulfate to the diet. 47 
The present study has shown that a small alteration 
in diet, namely, the substitution of 15 g" day-* sucrose 
by 15 g ' d a y  -1 OF or inulin, can lead to significant 
changes in the balance of the constituent microflora in the 
large intestine. Despite the relatively insensitive nature of 
bacteriologic techniques for enumerating microorgan- 
isms in feces and wide individual variation, bifidobacteria 
increased significantly when subjects were fed OF and 
inulin, whereas numbers of potential pathogens decreased 
with OF. These observations confirm results from in vitro 
s t u d i e s  27'48'49 that showed that the stimulation of bifido- 
bacterial growth was relatively specific to OF and the 
related carbohydrate inulin. In vivo studies with other 
fermentable carbohydrates have failed to show a bifido- 
genic effect. It is believed that bifidobacteria have rela- 
tively high amounts of ~-fructosidase that is selective for 
~1-2 glycosidic bonds present in fructooligosaccha- 
rides. 5° Subsequent transport mechanisms and rates of 
hydrolysis may also be faster. After oligosaccharide hy- 
drolysis, monomers then serve as an efficient growth sub- 
strate for the bifidus pathway of hexose fermentation) I 
In addition, the inhibitory effects of bifidobacterial 
growth on other colonic organisms 2. are likely to assist 
in the competitive influence that occurred with OF and 
inulin. 
OF is a lower-molecular-weight version of inulin, and 
the two forms exist in plants such as artichokes, chicory, 
onions, leeks, garlic, asparagus, with smaller amounts in 
many cereals. Inulins are mostly linear polymers of fruc- 
tose with glucose as the terminal sugar. OF, usually DP 
2 - 5 ,  is produced commercially in one of two ways: either 
by partial hydrolysis using endoglycosidases, e.g., Rafti- 
lose, which is made from chicory inulin, or by synthesis 
from sucrose using fungal fructofuronosidase, e.g., Neo-  
sugar. 2~ OF is almost certainly not digested in the human 
small intestine, although final proof of this is still lack- 
ing)  2 Its recovery from the small intestine of rats is 
approximately the same as that of an unabsorbed marker, 
polyethylene glycol. 53 OF is not hydrolyzed when incu- 
bated with human salivary enzymes or rat pancreatic 
homogenate, 25 and oral dosing of OF does not affect 
blood glucose in humans. 25'5<55 Fermentation in the large 
bowel is most probable. In vitro incubation of *4C-labeled 
OF with the cecal contents from rats showed 66% of the 
label appearing as short-chain fatty acids, with some be- 
ing metabolized to CO2 or incorporated into the bio- 
mass) 6 In the same study, feeding OF to conventional 
rats showed rapid fermentation of OF, whereas germ-free 
animals delayed excretion of label for many hours, and 
substantial amounts appeared in feces. Breath H2 studies 
in humans have indicated that the majority of OF is 
fermented) 4 These oligosaccharides cannot be detected 
in feces even after inulin feeding. 5v In the present studies, 
a clear increase in breath H2 was observed during OF 
and inulin feeding, although changes in breath C H  4 were  
more erratic in the 3 methanogenic subjects. 
Previous studies in humans have shown that OF had a 
modifying effect on stool frequency, reducing functional 
constipation 58 and relieving both constipation and loose 
stools. 55 In our study, stool frequency increased when OF 
was included in the diet. However, the increase persisted 
after OF was replaced by sucrose, suggesting that this 
effect was not mediated via the presence of a fermentable 
substrate in the colon but more likely some other factor, 
such as a change in the composition of the colonic mi- 
croflora. Increases (14% and 34%) in daily stool output 
were observed when OF and inulin were introduced into 
the diet. In this respect, they are acting like any other 
indigestible carbohydrate, such as nonstarch polysaccha- 
rides 59 and resistant starch, 6° which produce a laxative 
effect through fermentation. In terms of the magnitude 
of the effect determined in the present study (1.3 g and 
2.0 g increase in stool weight per gram in subjects fed 
OF and inulin, respectively), this is less than that observed 
with sources of nonstarch polysaccharides, such as bran 
(5.4 g) and fruit and vegetables (4.7 g), but similar to that 
produced by rapidly fermented nonstarch polysaccharides, 
such as pectin (1.2 g).59 T h e  increase in fecal output is 
likely to be attributable to an increase in biomass that is 
confirmed by the significant increase in nitrogen excretion 
observed for both substrates. The additional 0.32 g of N 
excreted is equivalent to approximately 5 g of bacterial 
solids, 61 and at the moisture content of the stools in the 
present study, this amount is the equivalent of 20-25 g 
of wet stool. This is almost exactly the increase observed 
(Tables 1 and 2) in stool wet weight output. 
April 1995  DIETARY STIMULATION OF BIFIDOBACTERIA 981  
Fifteen grams of OF has a gross energy of about 240 
kJ. During the OF dietary period, about 77 kJ" day -1 
additional fecal energy was excreted, which suggested 
that although fermentation of OF resulted in some in- 
creased excretion of energy, much of the energy provided 
became available through the absorption of short-chain 
fatty acids. Although there was a larger increase in fecal 
energy excreted when subjects were fed inulin (about 99 
kJ" day-l), energy from this increase was still available 
through fermentation. The fact that all subjects main- 
tained their weight when 15 g of sucrose was substituted 
by OF or inulin confirms that, at this level of inclusion, 
they had little effect on total metabolizable energy. Previ- 
ous studies have shown that feeding subjects OF increases 
fecal mineral losses62; however, in this study, OF had no 
effect on total minerals (ash) excreted, although inulin 
feeding did result in an increase in excreted minerals 
that was not significant. In general, OF and inulin had 
very little effect on bowel habit and fecal composition 
other than increasing output. The most important effects 
were those on the colonic microflora. 
Both OF and inulin acted as selective bifidogenic fac- 
tors by increasing their numbers in absolute terms and 
as a proportion of total anaerobes, thus resulting in Bifid- 
obacterium becoming the predominant bacterial genus. 
Are the changes which these oligosaccharides induce in 
the colonic microflora of any benefit to health? Bifido- 
bacteria can represent up to 95% of the total gut mi- 
croflora of breast-fed infants compared with only 25% 
in adults. 12'13 This is believed to be a principal reason 
why such infants suffer relatively less gastrointestinal 
infection than bottle-fed infants. Although bifidobacteria 
have been implicated in some opportunistic infections, 63 
they are generally regarded as benign and even beneficial. 
They stimulate immune function, particularly against 
malignant cells, and produce vitamins of the B group, 
and perhaps most importantly, we have shown in vitro 
that they suppress the growth of pathogenic species. 2. 
In this present study, numbers of bacteroides, clostridia, 
and fusobacteria were significantly decreased when sub- 
jects were fed OF. All of these may be pathogenic, e.g., 
through their proteolytic capabilities and toxin produc- 
tion. 
In conclusion, this study has shown that a relatively 
straightforward dietary manipulation may alter the com- 
position of the gut bacteria to produce a potentially 
healthier community.
