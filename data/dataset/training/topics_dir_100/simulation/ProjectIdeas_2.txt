Delaunay triangulation
For each triangle, the circumcircle does not contain any other points 
of the pointset

Genetic algorithms
Darwin’s principle of evolution (“survival of the
fittest”) may be used to construct effective
optimization algorithms
11
An individual (chromosome) represents a candidate
solution for the problem at hand.
A collection of individuals currently "alive“, called
population is evolved from one generation to
another depending on the fitness of individuals,
indicating how fit an individual is, in other words,
how close it is to an optimal solution.
At each evolutionary step, crossover and mutation
(Genetic Operators) are applied on individuals,
respectively.
Genetic algorithms

Swarm intelligence
Social insects - such as ants and bees - give us a
powerful metaphor for developing decentralized
problem solving systems consisting of simple co-
operating agents.

Ant colony optimization
Each ant leaves a trail of pheromones when it
explores the solution landscape. This trail is meant
to guide other ants.
The trail will be taken into account when an ant
chooses the next location to move to, making it
more prone to walk the path with the strongest
pheromone trail.
14
Timetabling
Assign a number of events to a limited number of
time periods.
Course planning: Assign each lecture to some
period of the week in such a way that no student is
required to take more than one lecture at a time.
International Timetabling Competition:

Problem solving
Write a general Java package for problem solving.
For example, the package must be applicable to
solving the so-called 15-puzzle:

Automatic theorem proving
• Theorem proving:   to
show that a statement follows logically from some
other statements
• Automatic  theorem proving:
a mechanization of the proof
18
Example
• Given the following  2 statements:
All humans are mortal. 
Socrates is a human.
• Show that we may conclude that:
Socrates is mortal.
19
Project idea
Development of a program that reads a series of logical
statements, checks their correctness, and converts them
into a form that may be used in an existing program for
automatic theorem proving.
Input: Logical statements in first order predicate
Output: The statements transformed into disjunctive 
  normal form
Subjects: Syntax, semantics and translation
20
Data mining
Analysis of large data sets with the purpose of
finding meaningful patterns in the data.
Example: cluster analysis
21
Application of xgrid for distributed solution of some
chosen problem.
Distributed algorithms
22
Simulation of a computer
Development of a simulator for Donald Knuth’s MMIX machine.
23
Image compression
Compression of images be means of block truncation.
24
Symbolic differentiation
Given a symbolic expression as the following:
sin2(3x-2) + (3-2x)/(3+2x)
Input the expression. Output the differential
quotient with respect to x:
-3/2(cos(6x-9) - cos(2x-3)) - 12/(3+2x)2
25
Representation of images
Development of a program that, given a description as this one:
draws the picture
Picture spiral = new Picture(50);
spiral.plus(square).plus(spiral.origon(0,1).turned(10).
                    magnified(0.95, 0.95));
Picture ram = new Picture(1);
ram.plus(spiral).plus(spiral.origon(1,0).magnified(-1,1));

transforms the permutation into (1 2 3 ... n).
