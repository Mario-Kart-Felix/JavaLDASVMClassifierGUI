Abstract for an Invited Paper
for the MAR05 Meeting of
The American Physical Society
Evolution and structure of the Internet: A statistical physics approach
ALESSANDRO VESPIGNANI, School of Informatics and Department of Physics, Indiana University
The talk will present an overview of the large-scale topological and dynamical properties of real Internet maps. First I will review the
methodology used to obtain large scale maps of the Internet at the router and autonomous system level. Then I will discuss the statistical
features and regularities observed in the large scale structure of the Internet and the importance of the dynamics in the formulation of
adequate models. Finally the various results and models will be scrutinized in the light of a statistical theory that considers the mapâ€™s
incompleteness due to measurement biases.
