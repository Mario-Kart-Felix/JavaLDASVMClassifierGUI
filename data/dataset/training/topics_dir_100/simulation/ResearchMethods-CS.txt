What is Science?
Computer Science ?
Sciences – Objects - Methods
The Scientific Method
1. Pose the question in the context of existing knowledge (theory & observations).
- new question that old theories are capable of answering (usually the case), or
- question that calls for formulation of a new theory.
2. Formulate a hypothesis as a tentative answer.
3. Deduce consequences and make predictions.
4. Test the hypothesis in a specific experiment/theory field. 
The new hypothesis must prove to fit in the existing world-view . 
In case the hypothesis leads to contradictions and demands a radical change in the existing theoretical 
background, it has to be tested particularly carefully. 
The new hypothesis has to prove fruitful and offer considerable advantages, in order to replace the 
existing scientific paradigm. 
Rule: loop 2-3-4 is repeated with modifications of the hypothesis until the agreement is obtained, which 
leads to 5. If major discrepancies are found the process must start from the beginning, 1.
5. When consistency is obtained the hypothesis becomes a theory and provides a coherent set of 
propositions that define a new class of phenomena or a new theoretical concept. 
The results have to be published. 
Theory at that stage is subject of process of ”natural selection” among competing theories (6). A theory is 
then becoming a framework within which observations/theoretical facts are explained and predictions 
are made. The process can start from the beginning, but the state 1 has changed to include the new 
theory/improvements of old theory.

What is Computer Science?
Discipline of Computing:     Informatics?
• Computer Science
• Computer Engineering
• Software Engineering
• Information Systems
Definitions:
1.   The discipline of Computing is the systematic study of algorithmic processes that 
describe and transform information: their theory, analysis, design, efficiency, 
implementation, and application.
2.   Computer Science is the study of phenomena related to computers, Newell, Perlis 
and Simon, 1967.
3.   Computer Science is the study of information structures, Wegner, 1968, Curriculum 
68.
4.   Computer Science is the study and management of complexity, Dijkstra, 1969.
5.   Computer Science is the mechanization of abstraction, Aho and Ullman 1992.
6.   Computer Science is a field of study that is concerned with theoretical and applied 
disciplines in the development and use of computers for information storage and 
processing, mathematics, logic, science, and many other areas.
Scientific Methods of Computer Science
• Modeling
• Theoretical Computer Science
• Experimental Computer Science
• Computer Simulation
Modeling - 1
Modeling - 2
• How to model?
– What to take into account /neglect? -> features
• Is the model appropriate?
– Purpose, resolution, level of abstraction
• Aspects of features / behavior?
• Difference to reality?
• Validation? Are the results valid?
• Special constraints
Theoretical CS
• Logic and Mathematics
– Objects (axioms)
– Operations (rules)
• Conceptualization, modeling, and analysis: 
data models, algorithms, complexity
– Data model: values of data objects and operations
• Different levels of abstraction
• Efficiency
• Methodologies: iteration, recursion, induction
Experimental CS
• Information processes: formulate phenomena, 
explanations, testing
• Experiments: theory testing, exploration
– Theoretical predictions <-> Reality
– Edsger Dijkstra: “… an experiment can only show 
the presence of bugs (flows) in a theory, not their 
absence.”
Computer Simulation - 1
• Computional Science
Computer Simulation - 2
• Investigations beyond current experimental 
capabilities
• Study phenomena that cannot be replicated in 
laboratories
• Guided by theory and experimental results 
(feedback loop)
• Simulate phenomena and processes
Thesis Proposal (multiple iterations, 10-15 pages) 
6 essential questions that must be answered:
1. What is the problem? (Literature!)
2 possibilities:
- new problem -> find a solution
- known problem & existing solutions -> find a better solution
2. What has been done (by others) already to solve this 
problem? (Literature!)
3. What is missing? What is not good in other 
approaches/solutions? (Literature!)
4. What are you planning to do?
5. What will be the result(s) in the end?
6. Rough idea (description) of the way to the end - finished PhD 
thesis (to reach the goal, i.e. solve the problem)
includes time plan: 
- what has already been achieved
- what has still to be done
