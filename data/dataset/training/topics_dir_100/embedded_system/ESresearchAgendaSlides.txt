Abstract
The world of embedded systems research is quite large. This document identifies
the trends and hot topics in the world of embedded systems. Next it proposes a
subset of this world as the working area for the Embedded Systems Institute.
Distribution
This article or presentation is written as part of the Gaudí project. The Gaudí project
philosophy is to improve by obtaining frequent feedback. Frequent feedback is pursued by an
open creation process. This document is published as intermediate or nearly mature version
to get feedback. Further distribution is allowed as long as the document remains complete
and unchanged.

Assumptions
1. Methods that fulfil multiple objectives  exist to create embedded systems
2. These methods help to  speed up the creation process, reduce the risks,
and increase the product quality
3. These methods are generic for multiple market/business domains ,
application domains  and functional domains
4. These methods build upon the software and electronics technologies ,
and to a lesser degree these methods build upon the more  conventional
technologies , such as mechatronics and physics.
5. These methods need an intelligent adaptation  to the specific domain

Status quo in industry
The current working methods result in acceptable working systems, but:
- the integration and test phase is often too long and exceed the original planning
- too many product creations fail
- the qualities emerge more than they are designed in
Organizational focus is mono-disciplinary
Process and orgnaization have a big impact on product creation
Many technical decisions are based on local technical considerations.
Many business decisions are based on local business considerations.
Technical and business decisions must be linked.

More Specific Assumptions
CAFCR and qualities are a useful  framework for a further decomposition of methods
The working field can be narrowed by focusing on a subset of qualities
ESI must concentrate on qualities where knowhow is present in the  institute
and in the network-partners
ESI must concentrate on qualities that are challenging from technology viewpoint
ESI must concentrate on qualities that are valuable from business viewpoint
The value of ESI is in the multi-disciplinary  achievement of these qualities
Submethods over all CAFCR views are needed to  achieve the qualities
This type of research requires partners that have the  in-depth technology domain
know-how
This type of research requires partners that have the  in-depth application  and
business domain know-how

ESRAassumptionsSpecific
Industry as laboratory
Method research  requires practical experience
Application of the method is  80% of the effort,
reflection and abstraction at most 20%
Industry as laboratory  is a research method where  the  creation methods
are applied in actual industrial context
The application of methods in the actual industrial context is necessary  to:
1. build up experience
2  verify assumptions  about improvements of methods
To research new methods a  hypothesis is required about the method
improvements
