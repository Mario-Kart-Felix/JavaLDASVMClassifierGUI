What is an Embedded System? 
Embedded Systems = Information processing 
systems embedded into a larger product. 
   -- Peter Marwedel, TU Dortmund 
Embedded Software = Software integrated with 
physical processes. The technical problem is 
managing time and concurrency in computational 
systems. 
   -- Edward A. Lee, UC Berkeley 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Examples of application domains: automotive electronics, 
avionics, multimedia, consumer electronics, etc. 
 Environment: type and properties of input/output 
information. 
 Tightly coupled: the environment dictates what the 
system’s response behavior must be. (“ES cannot 
synchronize with environment”) 
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 4 
Yet Another Definition ... 
Embedded Systems = Information processing 
systems that are: 
• application domain specific (not general purpose) 
• tightly coupled to their environment  
 
 
 
 
 
 
What they do: 
 Sense environment(input signals) 
 Process input information 
 Respond in real-time (output signals)

Outline 
 Must be dependable 
o Reliability: R(t) = probability of a system working correctly 
at time t provided that it was working at t = 0 
o Maintainability: M(d) = probability of a system working 
correctly d time units after error occurred 
o Availability: A(t) = probability of system working at time t 
o Safety: no harm to be caused by failing system 
o Security: confidential and authentic communication 
 
 
 
 
  
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 16 
Characteristics of Embedded Systems (1) 
- Even perfectly designed systems can fail if the assumptions 
about the workload and possible errors turn out to be wrong. 
- Making the system dependable must not be an after-thought, 
it must be considered from the very beginning. 
 Must be efficient 
o Energy efficient 
• Many ES are mobile systems powered by batteries 
• Customers expect long run-times from batteries but 
• Battery technology improves at a very slow rate 
o Code-size efficient (especially for systems on a chip) 
• Typically there are no hard discs or huge memories to store 
code 
o Run-time efficient 
• Meet time constraints with least amount of HW resources 
and energy – only necessary HW should be present working 
at as low as possible Vdd and fclk 
o Weight efficient (especially for portable ES) 
o Cost efficient (especially for high-volume ES) 
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 17 
Characteristics of Embedded Systems (2) 
 Many ES must meet real-time constraints 
o A real-time system must react to stimuli from the 
controlled object (or the operator) within the time 
interval dictated by the environment. 
o For real-time systems, right answers arriving too late 
(or even too early) are wrong. 
 
 
 
 All other time-constraints are called soft. 
 A guaranteed system response has to be 
explained without statistical arguments. 
 
 12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 18 
Characteristics of Embedded Systems (3) 
“A real-time constraint is called hard, if not meeting that 
constraint could result in a catastrophe“ [Kopetz, 1997]. 
 ES are connected to physical environment 
through sensors and actuators. 
 Hybrid Systems, i.e., composed of analog and 
digital parts 
 Typically, ES are reactive systems 
 
 
 
 
o Behavior depends on input and current state. 
automata model appropriate 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 19 
Characteristics of Embedded Systems (4) 
“A reactive system is one which is in continual interaction 
with is environment and executes at a pace determined by 
that environment“ [Bergé, 1995]. 
 All ES are dedicated systems 
o Dedicated towards a certain application:  
• Knowledge about the behavior at design time can be used to 
minimize resources and to maximize robustness 
o Dedicated user interface: 
• No mice, no large keyboards and monitors 
Not every ES has all of the above characteristics, thus 
 
 
   
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 20 
Characteristics of Embedded Systems (5) 
We can define the term “Embedded System” as follows: 
Information processing systems having most of the above 
characteristics are called embedded systems. 
Comparison 
Embedded Systems 
• Execute few applications that 
are known at design-time 
• Non programmable by the end 
user 
• Fixed run-time requirements 
(additional computing power 
not useful) 
 
• Important criteria 
– Cost 
– Power consumption 
– Predictability 
– ... 
General Purpose Systems 
• Execute broad class of 
applications 
• Programmable by the end user 
• Faster is better 
 
 
• Important criteria 
– Cost 
– Average speed

Definition of Cyber-Physical System 
 Defined by those with Money 
o Smart electric grid 
o Smart transportation 
 Wikipedia 
o A full-fledged CPS is typically designed as a network of 
interacting elements with physical input and output instead of 
as standalone devices 
 Cyber-Physical (cy-phy) Systems (CPS) are integrations of 
computation with physical processes [Edward Lee, 2006]. 
 
 Cyber-physical system (CPS) = 
Embedded System (ES) + physical environment

What is a Cyber-Physical System? 
Physical Cyber 
Digital Controls Systems, ca. 1980 
Cyber-Physical Systems, 2010+ ! 
 Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems 
that are built from and depend upon the synergy of 
computational and physical components.   
 Emerging CPS will be coordinated, distributed, and 
connected, and must be robust and responsive.   
 The CPS of tomorrow will need to far exceed the 
systems of today in capability, adaptability, resiliency, 
safety, security, and usability. 
 Examples of the many CPS application 
areas include the smart electric grid, smart 
transportation, smart buildings, smart medical 
technologies, next-generation air traffic management, 
and advanced manufacturing.

Definition According to National Science 
Foundation (US) 
 The physical world and the virtual world – or cyber-
space – are merging; cyber-physical systems are 
developing. Future cyber-physical systems will 
contribute to security, efficiency, comfort and health 
systems as never before, and as a result, they will 
contribute to solving key challenges of our society, such 
as the aging population, limited resources, mobility, or 
energy transition.

Outline 
 In the past Embedded Systems were called Embedded 
(micro-)Controllers 
 They appeared typically in control dominated applications: 
o Traffic lights control 
o Elevators control 
o Washing machines and dishwashers 
o Electronic Control Unit (ECU) 
o ... 
 They were implemented using a single μProcessor or 
dedicated HW (sequential circuit) 
 
 All this is rapidly changing nowadays. 
o How And Why? 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 30 
Trends in Embedded Systems 
Complexity of ES is increasing, thus 
 A single uProcessor is sufficient for some consumer 
products 
o Application performance demands relatively low 
 For other systems – such as cars and aircrafts – a 
network of processors is needed 
o Due to performance requirements 
o Due to safety requirements (a single failed component 
should not cause total system failure) 
 For some systems – such as mobile devices – a network 
of heterogeneous processors is needed 
o Due to run-time efficiency requirements 
o Due to power efficiency 
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 31 
Trend 1: Towards Multi-Processor Systems 
Moore’s Law: the number of transistors that can be placed on 
a chip has doubled approximately every two years 
 
 Microprocessor, microcontroller 
 System-on-Chip (SoC) 
o Processor + memory + I/O-units + communication structure 
 Multi-processor System on a Chip (MPSoC) 
o Processor – Co-processor 
o (Heterogeneous) Multi-processor 
o Network on Chip 
• Identical tiles 
• Scalable system 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 32 
Trend 2: Higher Degree of Integration

 Moore's law is the observation that, over the history of 
computing hardware, the number of transistors on 
integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Something that doubles frequently grows more quickly  
than most people realize! 
o A 2002 chip could hold about 15,000 1981 chips inside itself

Implementing ES in specialized HW brings lack of 
flexibility (changing standards) and very 
expensive masks, thus 
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 36 
Trend 3: Software Increasing  
 Most of the functionality 
will be implemented in 
software 
o On the average, a human 
“touches” about 50 to 100 
micro-processors per day 
o State-of-art car has 70~100 
micro-processors 
 Exponential increase in 
software complexity

Outline 
Embedded Systems Design is NOT just a special case of either 
hardware (Computer/Electrical Engineering) or software 
(SoftwareEngineering/Computer Science) design. 
 
 
 An embedded system performs computation that is subject 
to physical constraints, i.e., interaction with a physical 
environment and execution on a physical (implementation) 
platform 
o Interaction constraints: deadlines, throughput, jitter 
o Execution constraints: available resources, power, failure rates 
 It has functional requirements (expected services), and it 
has non-functional requirements (performance, power, 
cost, robustness, etc.) 
 
12/18/2013 Kai.Huang@tum 38 
Embedded Systems Design (1) 
 Computer Science provides (software) functionality for Instruction 
Set Architectures (ISA) which are characterized by 
o Instruction set 
o Organization (program counter, register file, memory) 
o Both independent of any logical implementation and physical 
realization 
 Computer/Electrical Engineering deals with 
o Logical implementation 
o Physical realization 
 Embedded Systems design discipline needs to combine these two 
approaches, because non-functional behavior (such as timing, cost, 
power, robustness, etc.) is a crucial issue 
o when there are real-time constraints imposed by the environment 
o when to predict non-functional behavior using abstract models that 
cannot be well specified if the relation between functional behavior 
and non-functional behavior is obscure

market of PC-like systems 
o Post-PC era in which information processing is more and 
more moving away from just PCs to embedded systems
