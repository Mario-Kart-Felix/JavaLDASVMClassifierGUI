This is the Final Study Report (Deliverable D7) of the study "Design of Future 
Embedded Systems" by IDC on behalf of DG Information Society and Media of the 
European Commission. 
The scope of the study is the evolution of the Embedded Systems Design (ESD) field 
towards Systems of Systems, with a specific focus on the industry viewpoint and the 
emerging opportunities able to improve European competitiveness. The study has a 
double focus on: 
 Supporting the preparation of Horizon 2020 for the Embedded systems design 
area, through the identification of the main scientific and research challenges 
(including possible evolution of the Artemis JU program); the study needs to 
establish a coherent view for future FP7 research challenges with a mapping of 
the latest ARTEMIS SRA; 
 Analyzing the emerging System of Systems market and relative scientific and 
research challenges. 
This report is the second part of the study and defines the ESD market and System of 
Systems used for market analysis and forecast as well as the technology baseline to 
support ICT WP preparation vis-à-vis ARTEMIS JU in the area. It describes their main 
components. The report establishes an assessment on RD&I trends, identifies 
industry, research and scientific challenges, and defines priorities. It articulates major 
market trends addressing in particular issues of cross-fertilization. 
The report quantifies market forecast by sector (vertical market) and by technology/ 
application area. It qualifies and details the forecast data presented and shows 
references. The report describes the value chain and analyzes the roles of the main 
stakeholders assessing their strengths and weaknesses. 
The annexes describe the main RD&I programs in France, Germany, UK, US, and 
Asia.

The 2020 scenario for Embedded systems is being defined today by the migration to 
more intelligent systems across the traditional Embedded systems marketplace. An 
Embedded system evolution centers on the integration of higher plane hardware and 
software technologies that allow user reconfiguration, enable autonomous operation, 
access the Internet, and extend the usage model of the system. 
In an attempt to consider what is common and underlying to Embedded systems 
evolution toward System of Systems, IDC suggests the following scheme which 
highlights three level of increasing complexity. 
Next-generation of Embedded systems brings together two innovation areas: 
 Embedded Systems: with the adoption of high-performance and highly 
programmable microprocessors, Internet connectivity, and high-level operating 
systems and Middleware; 
 Global Digital Networks: A world of data and services - the internet. 
We can anticipate three main level of complexity coming from this new situation: the 
proliferation of devices, the proliferation of data, and the diversity and richness of 
functions and services, interoperability and networking. 
 The proliferation of devices - A world of high computing density; 
 The proliferation of data - A world of data and analytics collected by the system; 
 The diversity and richness of functions and services, interoperability and 
networking. 
In order to list the main challenges posed by the System of Systems concept we 
based our analysis on the work published by Jean-Luc Garnier and Hermann Kopetz 
[GAR2011-1, GAR2011-2, KOPETZ2011] who both identified key challenges which 
are useful for the analysis of Embedded systems scientific and challenges to be 
addressed in a 2020 perspective. We used these analyses as a guideline to establish 
2020 RD&I trends in the section dedicated to scientific and technologic research 
challenges (see section 1.2 entitled "Characteristic required and sector exigencies"). 
This enabled to qualify the interviewed stakeholders and workshop participants' 
inputs by putting them in a perspective of Embedded systems evolution towards 
System of Systems. 
The analysis of Jean-Luc Garnier identifies six challenges from an industry point of 
view on SoS regarding systems engineering. It highlights the key role that ICT will 
play in System of Systems in the following areas: 
 Network and services infrastructure; 
 Combination of IT and socio-technical approaches; 
2 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Human system integration and interface; 
 Virtualization; 
 Engineering processes and collaborative, life-cycle management; 
 Command and control; 
 Modeling and simulation. 
The analysis of Hermann Kopetz highlights the key difference between old-classic 
systems and new System of Systems: 
 System infrastructure and services relies on different organizations with different 
architecture styles; 
 Subsystems are autonomous, based on interoperability of components; 
 Standards must be international standard and not limited to a single organization; 
 Design is based on changing specification and uncoordinated evolution while the 
scope of system is not identified.

1.2.1 Analysis 
Based on the inputs of workshop participants and interviewed stakeholders (OEMs 
interviews) as well as the literature we defined the required characteristics for 
Embedded systems in their evolution in a context of System of Systems. We indicate 
the requirements with respect of: 
 Criticality exigencies: safety, security and certifications. Safety embraces all 
Embedded systems applications even if the level of criticality of safety varies 
depending on the applications. The sectors which are operating closely to the 
consumer market (medical equipments, building telecommunications, home 
electronic equipments, city infrastructures…) show that security is a critical 
exigency. In this context security is an enabler of trust for the client and damages 
caused by the security attack are important. In other sectors even if safety 
remains the first concern the need of protecting the systems from intrusion and 
attack deliberate or not is growing; 
 Distributed architecture management & autonomy of systems. This requirement 
is transverse to all sectors; 
 Seamless connection refers to all Embedded systems connected to the Web in 
order to access relevant information in real-time; 
 The Human Machine Interface (HMI) issues are transverse to all sectors; 
 Multi-core processors & virtualization software issues are transverse to all 
sectors; 
 Energy management of small devices: the sectors which are operating under 
specific constraints of limited energy source access (aerospace, 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 3 
communications, healthcare) show that energy management devices are a 
critical exigency. 
The question of cooperation and cross-fertilization is defined by Jean-Luc Garnier in 
engineering processes and collaborative, life-cycle management and combination of 
IT and socio-technical approaches challenges. It also often came up during the 
interviews and workshops. Stakeholders considered that cooperation between 
experts of Embedded systems technologies and experts of the different application 
areas (health, mobility, energy…) as well as the reinforcement of synergies are two 
approaches to be favored. Initiatives of cooperation across sectors are already 
started (see for instance Numatec initiative in "Value chain" chapter). 
The study team defined a ―reference framework‖ which categorizes and characterizes 
the wide range of tools and methods supporting Embedded system design ESD. We 
use this reference framework as a baseline to define and analyze the technologic, 
scientific and business challenges, and to quantify and forecast the ESD market. 
The reference framework defines 6 categories of software tools supporting the design 
of Embedded systems: 
 Application Development Software; 
 Change and Configuration Management Software; 
 Automated Software Quality; 
 PLM software; 
 Electronic design automation (EDA) software; 
 Content management software. 
1.2.2 Twelve priorities 
We identified twelve priority areas of scientific and technological research which are 
aligned with the context of evolution of Embedded systems towards System of 
Systems and which comply with the ESD definition. These priorities have been 
defined by combining the six required characteristics of Embedded systems and the 
ESD reference framework. 
 Safe & Secure systems: 
 Specification, code generation & verification for Safe & Secure systems; 
 Simulation & Certification; 
 Distributed architecture and autonomy of systems: 
 System analysis, specification and programming tools; 
 Simulation and design of large scale distributed architectures; 
 Seamless connection: 
 Development tools for SOA; 
4 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Web connectivity; 
 Human Machine interface: 
 Rapid HMI development tools' infrastructure; 
 Real-time in simulation; 
 Multi-core architecture and virtualization: 
 Transition to parallel architecture; 
 Architecture definition & design, certification; 
 Energy management: 
 Software development tools for power management; 
 Power management and integration in systems.

Embedded systems accounted for almost €852 billion of value in 2010. The overall 
industry is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% throughout the 
forecast period and should reach €1,5 trillion in revenue by 2015. This is growing not 
only at a faster pace than traditional IT spending but also more than 1.5 times faster 
than the overall semiconductor industry. 
Energy is the fastest growing market (2010-2015 GAGR: 34%) while 
communications, Automotive and healthcare market will be sustained by an annual 
double digit growth along the period. 
The worldwide market for Embedded System Development Software was worth about 
€3.31 billion in 2010. IDC forecasts that the worldwide market for ESD software will 
expand at a healthy 7.1% compound annual growth rate to surpass €6,5 billion in 
2020. 
European ESD software revenues in 2010 amounted to about €986 billion, or 30% of 
worldwide revenues, compared with 46% of North America and 19% of the Asia-
Pacific region including Japan. Note that Europe's and North America's 2010-2020 
CAGR (Compound Average Growth Rate) are slightly below the worldwide total ESD 
Software revenue growth in the same period; the European one is estimated at 6.3% 
and the North American one at 6.8%.

Europe benefits from strong OEMs base on Automotive and Aerospace & Defense 
sectors but also from smaller markets such as Electricity/Gas/Water utilities, and 
Energy Equipment. Stakeholder interviews inputs indicate that OEMs drive the 
innovation and technology development. In emergent software applications close 
collaboration between OEMs and Software vendor companies is considered critical 
for developing first products. In this context OEMs create a strong internal market for 
the SMEs. This is particularly important for small software companies which have 
mainly local operations and few international capabilities (see section dedicated to 
Software vendors). By way of illustration, the automotive standard AUTOSAR is an 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 5 
example of common agreement between major end-users and OEMs. AUTOSAR 
now has the capability to structure an ecosystem of Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. 
Interviewed players insisted on the power of networking and interactions between 
companies to generate innovation. Local cluster experiences in Germany, France and 
the UK demonstrate that cooperation must be across industries/sectors but also with 
innovation-thirsty emerging markets in order to facilitate cross-domain fertilization and 
to enable to leverage certain investments such as validation and testing to minimize 
liability and cost. Collaboration initiatives between regional clusters are undertaken in 
order to increase the competitiveness of the clusters and their efficiency through the 
coordination of research projects encompassing members of all clusters involved in 
the initiatives. 
Europe is seen by interviewed stakeholders to have established a successful model 
of investing in research projects and coordinating the research and innovation 
activities in the area of ESD with governmental support available (national, 
international). Most of the interviewees collaborate in European Projects. 
A missing partner has been identified in the innovation value chain. Most of the 
interviewed stakeholders, more specifically those working in Research and Software 
vendor organizations, noted that overall the Venture Capitalists (VCs) community is 
not widely present and actively involved in European Embedded systems 
ecosystems. 
The supply side of the ESD software market is very fragmented. IDC estimates that 
there are about 430 European ESD software vendors but there are no more than 20 
companies with turnover over 10M€ which account to nearly the three quarters of the 
market. Dassault Systèmes and SiemensPLM are the two largest companies. 
According to interviewed stakeholders, more specifically the interviewed OEMs, the 
competition is global and favors global and large software vendors who are able to 
compete in global market. The mains reasons are the following: 
 Large ESD software vendors can set de facto standards for the industry and take 
position on the market; 
 To be successful software vendors need to reach a certain size that allows them 
to be considered in RFPs of large industrials who tend to work with well-
established companies that become preferred suppliers leaving little room for 
SMEs and new players; 
 Strong suppliers must be developed in the most demanding and breakthrough 
technologies in order to address the emerging market requirement and compete 
with the right technological capacity. 
The embedded semiconductor supplier landscape supports a diverse set of 
companies, and markets. 
ARM's architecture is dominant in large volume cell phones market – 90% on smart 
and mobile phones, 70% on portable media players – where ARM's architecture is 
dominant and accounts for 62% of all ARM-based shipments. The ARM architecture 
only accounts for a small part of the overall MCU market (10%). MCU replacement is 
one of ARM's fastest-growing licensing and volume shipment opportunities. New 
generation of Embedded systems will accelerate this migration as MCUs give way to 
32-bit microprocessor architectures because there is more demand for 32-bit support,

This is the Interim Study Report 2 (Deliverable D4) of the study "Design of Future 
Embedded Systems" by IDC on behalf of DG Information Society and Media of the 
European Commission.  
 
2 . 1  F o c u s  a n d  S c o p e  
The scope of the study is the evolution of the Embedded Systems Design and 
Engineering (ESD) field towards Systems of Systems, with a specific focus on the 
industry viewpoint and the emerging opportunities able to improve European 
competitiveness. The study has a double focus on: 
 Supporting the preparation of Horizon 2020 for the Embedded systems design 
area, through the identification of the main scientific and research challenges 
(including possible evolution of the Artemis JU program); the study needs to 
establish a coherent view for future Horizon 2020 research challenges with a 
mapping to the latest ARTEMIS SRA; 
 Analyzing the emerging SoS market and relative scientific and research 
challenges.  
The second Interim Report (D4): 
 Defines the ESD market and SoS used for market analysis and forecast as well 
as the technology baseline to support ICT WP preparation vis-à-vis ARTEMIS JU 
in the area. It describes their main components; 
 Establishes an assessment on RD&I trends, identifies industry, research and 
scientific challenges, and defines priorities. It articulates major market trends 
addressing in particular issues of cross-fertilization; 
 Quantifies market forecast by sector (vertical market) and by technology/ 
application area. The report qualifies and details the forecast data presented and 
shows references; 
 Designs the value chain and the roles of the main stakeholders; 
 Describes the main RD&I programs in France, Germany, UK, US, and Asia. 
2.1.1 Definition 
The working definition of Embedded Systems Design used in this study is the 
following: 
Embedded Systems Design definition. Embedded Systems Design (ESD) is the 
branch of engineering concerned with the development of Embedded systems and 
focuses on: the real-world goals for, services provided by, and constraints on such 
systems. It is about the processes, methods and tools for the development of 
Embedded systems in an economic and timely manner. 
As reported in the paragraph 1.2 of this report we have defined a ―reference 
framework‖ that categorizes and characterizes the wide range of tools and methods 
8 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
supporting ESD (architecture tools, design, implementation and verification tools, 
integration tools, transversal tools… see Chapter 5 "Embedded systems market size 
and ESD structure"). 
2.1.2 ESD Value Chain 
The ESD value chain includes a high number of actors, interacting with different roles 
and responsibilities. The main players considered in this study are the following: 
 Large manufacturing companies including OEMs: Airbus, EADS, Ericsson, 
Nokia, Philips, Thales, Volkswagen…. These technology and business leaders 
increasingly integrate Embedded systems in their products in order to innovate 
and increase their global competitiveness; 
 High-tech Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), who can be both industrial 
and/or engineering companies and/or software vendors. Their role is of 
increasing importance in various phases of the value chain, since manufacturers 
tend more and more to outsource to specialized SMEs the design and 
implementation phases of Embedded systems. SMEs can be research partners 
of large industrial companies in the upstream part of the value chain; or 
technology and services suppliers in the downstream; 
 Research laboratories. They developed a well recognized expertise in the 
domains of engineering, mathematics, and software for Embedded system; 
 Industry Clusters. They are linked to industry, suppliers, academic 
organizations, and to all stakeholders in the area of Embedded systems. 
2.1.3 Sectors 
When analyzing potential opportunities and application sectors, we segment the 
market as follows in order to take into account the industry specificities potentially 
affecting Embedded systems design: 
 Automotive, including electronic control units in chassis systems, power train 
electronics, body electronics/security systems, information and computing 
systems, e.g. for traffic control, and, for example, collaborative active safety 
systems, autonomous driving; 
 Avionics/ Aerospace, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft, and satellite 
systems, and, for example, mission critical information systems; 
 Industrial Automation, including manufacturing and process controls, motion 
controllers, operator interfaces, robotics, HVAC and other controls; 
 Transport, water, environmental protection, including, for example, climate 
change impact, ecosystem monitors; 
 Health and Medical Equipment, including patient monitoring equipment, medical 
therapy equipment, diagnostic equipment, imaging equipment, surgical systems, 
and, for example, remote patient monitoring, health care for healthy people; 
 Energy consumption point (home/building) technology, including intelligent 
Home, and, for example, net-zero energy buildings, unified 
safety/security/enterprises networks; 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 9 
 Communications, including infrastructure, services and end devices, and, for 
example, integrated container; 
 Consumer Electronics, including set-top boxes, Internet access devices, home 
audio/video, and white goods; 
 Energy, including, for example, ―smart‖ management of energy distribution and 
consumption.

The chief goal of IDC's methodology of the Study was to capture the opinions of 
representative stakeholders of the European ESD community, along with the 
interviews to key individuals, and a web and literature review. IDC employed the 
following methods. 
2.3.1 Two Workshops in Brussels 
2.3.1.1  May 2011 
A first Workshop was held in Brussels on May 12
th
 and 13
th,
 2011. The objective was 
to assist the project team in assessing the state of the Embedded Systems Software 
Industry in Europe through open discussions and information sharing about initiatives 
and market trends. More specifically, the goals were to identify user needs, research 
challenges and opportunities in Embedded systems, discuss System of Systems 
aspects and provide input about concrete recommendations for future EU research. A 
key output of this workshop was the gathering of information, data, perceptions, 
points of view, and recommendations of a large number of key stakeholders of 
Embedded Systems Engineering. The structure of the workshop was interactive and 
focused on the gathering of structured results. Invitations to the workshop were sent 
to all stakeholders and follow-up made by telephone or email. A total of 52 
participants (excluding IDC and European Commission participants) attended the 
workshop (see Annexes I 7.9). 
The workshop agenda was structured in plenary sessions and in four thematic 
working sessions. The themes of the four sessions were the following: 
 Assess future contributions of Embedded systems to society; 
 Investigate ways to support the ESD innovation ecosystem in a System of 
Systems perspective; 
 Analyze key scientific challenges and priorities;

2.3.2 Two consultation workshops 
Two consultation workshops organized by the EC were held in Brussels on the 4 July 
and on 22 September 2011. The objectives of these workshops were to identify 
challenges, define priorities and build a Strategy for the Future of the Complex 
Systems Engineering and System-of-Systems Industry in Europe through open 
discussions and information sharing about initiatives and market trends. 
A total of 20 participants attended the first consultation workshop and 32 the second 
consultation workshop. Participants contributed with presentations and participation to 
discussions. 
2.3.3 In-Depth Interviews with stakeholders 
From March to May 2011, IDC conducted 35 in-depth interviews, in person or by 
phone, with industry experts in Europe, software and services solution vendors for 
Embedded systems in Europe, high level scientists from academia and research 
institutes, and officials from Embedded systems clusters. These interviewees 
included some of the most well respected, highly knowledgeable individuals in the 
European and worldwide Embedded systems communities (see list in Annexes H 
7.8). Each interview typically lasted an hour or longer.

The 2020 scenario for Embedded systems is being defined today by the migration to 
more intelligent systems across the traditional Embedded systems marketplace. 
An Embedded system evolution centers on the integration of higher plane hardware 
and software technologies that allow for user reconfiguration, enable autonomous 
operation, access the Internet, and extend the usage model of the system.  
Not only we are seeing the volume of intelligent systems growing significantly, but the 
value of the data being captured by systems will grow even faster with each system 
connection. Next generation of Embedded systems promise to enable new innovation 
because of their connection which will drive more value as it allows companies and 
users to leverage, update through software, and enable new products and services 
within their marketplace. We can only imagine today how the data across all these 
intelligent systems will be used. What is apparent is that intelligent systems, in 
combination with cloud, location-based services, and social networks, will be able to 
reach the last node or touch the consumer. 
This, in essence, is the vision that we attempt to develop in this chapter which 
describes the following: 
 A synthetic view of interviewed stakeholders and workshop participants defining 
what is common to next generation of Embedded systems across sectors; 
 A discussion on System of Systems concept and a description of ICT challenges 
they raise.

In order to define what is common to all connected Embedded systems in a context of 
System of Systems we asked interviewed stakeholders and workshop participants to 
define the boundaries of the next generation of Embedded systems. It was felt in the 
discussion that it was difficult to simply define what will be a System of Systems in an 
industry perspective because System of Systems are multidisciplinary involving many 
players from diverse horizons, linking many constituent systems and technologies of 
a wide variety of scales, from individual groups of sensors to whole systems. By way 
of illustration Table 1 summarizes different views of System of Systems and their 
technological implications from different sectors.

Source: IDC, 2011 
In an attempt to consider what is common and underlying to Embedded systems 
evolution toward System of Systems we suggest the following scheme which 
highlights three level of increasing complexity. This picture is aligned with the vision of 
authors such as [see references ACATECH2011-1, POT2011-1, IDC2011-27]. 
Next-generation of Embedded systems brings together two innovation areas: 
 Embedded Systems: with the adoption of high-performance and highly 
programmable microprocessors, Internet connectivity, and high-level operating 
systems and Middleware; 
 Global Digital Networks: A world of data and services - the internet. 
We can anticipate three main level of complexity coming from this new situation: the 
proliferation of devices, the proliferation of data, and the diversity and richness of 
functions and services, interoperability and networking. 
 The proliferation of devices - A world of high computing density: 
We will see the proliferation of client devices and end-user or end-use devices at the 
network edge. According to IDC, of 7 billion things connected to the Internet in 2010 5 
billion were not computers. These other devices range from Internet-enabled cell 
phones and networked entertainment and gaming devices to automobiles, building 
automation systems, smart meters and thermostats, medical electronics, and 
industrial controllers. This does not even count RFID tags and sensors. 
IDC assumes that communicating client devices will proliferate at 5–10 times the rate 
of PCs installed. Devices will both converge (cell phones with more functionality) and 
diverge (single-use devices, such as RFID readers). We can expect a world of high 
computing density with a large number of devices per person, the threshold of 100 
processors per person could be achieved in 2020. As these types of devices 
proliferate, customers will require sophisticated systems management software tools 
to standardize, monitor, and track IT assets, software, patches, upgrades, and 
configurations. 
 The proliferation of data - A world of data and analytics collected by the system: 
The volume of the data captured by System of Systems will grow even faster with 
each system connection. The transformation to Embedded systems will enable the 
extension of computing so that every system has the potential to capture data from 
other systems and the environment because each system will be connected and 
integrate sensors. 
 The diversity and richness of functions and services, interoperability and 
networking: 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 17 
The cumulative impacts of computing power available, new software technologies 
and the Internet allowed exponential growth functions and services provided by the 
systems and interoperability capabilities between systems. These two aspects – 
diversity and richness of functions and services on one hand, interoperability and 
networking on the other – now lead to levels of complexity never achieved previously. 
The consequences are the following: 
 The diversity and richness of functions and services will continue to develop 
due to both societal demand effect and as a result of factor of differentiation 
and competitiveness for industry; 
 The limits of the technology state of the art in terms of controlling the 
complexity of design and development (especially for software aspects) are 
reached. New approaches and innovations are critical for designing the 
future generations of systems and complex objects; 
 If not properly controlled the diversity and richness of functions and services 
is a source of critical vulnerability especially when the system provides basic 
services and vital functions for the societies. 
 
3 . 2  C o n c e p t  o f  S y s t e m  o f  S y s t e m s  
The aim of this section is listing main challenges from an industry viewpoint on 
Systems of Systems regarding systems engineering and operation. 
Concept of System of Systems (SoS) is known since more than ten years, Many 
definitions exist for SoS (for a synthesis and discussion of theses definitions see 
[GAR2011-2]). A lot of literatures have studied the engineering of SoS and the 
innovation needed in this area but currently we have only high-level descriptions of 
what is and how we can work with. In order to list the main challenges posed by the 
System of Systems concept we based our analysis on the work published by Jean-
Luc Garnier and Hermann Kopetz [GAR2011-1, GAR2011-2, KOPETZ2011] who 
both identified key challenges which are useful for the analysis of Embedded systems 
scientific and challenges to be addressed in a 2020 perspective. 
The analyses of Garnier and Kopetz provide a framework which helps defining 
common challenges and ICT requirements to SoS. We used these analyses as a 
guideline to establish 2020 RD&I trends in the section dedicated to scientific and 
technologic research challenges (see section entitled "Characteristic required and 
sector exigencies"). This enabled to qualify the interviewed stakeholders and 
workshop participants' inputs by putting them in a perspective of Embedded systems 
evolution towards System of Systems. 
The analysis of Jean-Luc Garnier (see Table 2) is based on a discussion of Maier's 
criteria [MAIER-1]. His analysis identifies six challenges from an industry point of view 
on SoS regarding systems engineering. It highlights the key role that ICT will play in 
System of Systems in the following areas: 
 Modeling and simulation support the challenges of SoS management and 
Integrated Logistic Support. They are also a strong base to evaluate SoS 
regarding Maier's criteria (Operational independence of constituent system, 
Emergence, Evolutionary development, Geographical distribution). Modeling and 
simulation must be considered as a transverse discipline (behavior, multi-physic, 
human factor ―views‖, early validation, and reference for management); 
18 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Command and control supports the challenge of SoS management during 
operation (configuration, monitoring, supervision and reconfiguration). Garnier 
shows that SoS management cannot be considered as only management of 
individual systems since SoS behavior must take into account emerging effects 
which vary with constituent systems independence; 
 Network and services infrastructure: support the challenges of loose coupling 
within SoS to enable interaction constituent system within a SoS to comply as far 
as possible Maier's criteria, as well as of mixing paradigms for interaction within 
SoS. These interactions are exchange of services, products and data, events 
and streams; 
 Combination of IT and socio-technical approaches: Socio-technical approaches 
will be considered in the definition of loose coupling within SoS and in the 
anticipation of SoS behavior; 
 Human system integration and interface: support the challenges of loose 
coupling within SoS.; 
 Virtualization: supports the challenge of mastering SoS behavior by guarantying 
compatibility of the both levels – component systems independence and 
emergence – with both autonomy of component systems and coherency of the 
SoS; 
 Engineering processes and collaborative, life-cycle management: support the 
challenges of SoS engineering activities and life-cycle and of SoS engineering 
process. SoS engineering needs to address multiple systems engineering 
independent processes sustaining overarching solution being SoS. With respect 
to Maier's criteria the issue is to guaranty a solution issue fulfilling the defined 
SoS objectives and/or capabilities, while reusing existing systems as far as 
possible, and requiring some new ones.

4.1.1 Required characteristic and sector exigencies 
In order to define what the systems requirements will be when Embedded systems 
evolve toward System of Systems, we asked to the participants during the first 
workshop on May 2011 to describe the macro-environmental forces in the Embedded 
systems engineering vision for 2020. The results presented in Interim Report 1 of the 
study were refined with new inputs from the three other workshops and interactions 
with experts in order to focus on required characteristics for Embedded systems 
evolving in a context of System of Systems. 
Table 5 summarizes the characteristics against the four force analyzed (Political and 
legal drivers and issues; Economic drivers and challenges; Social drivers; 
Technological drivers and challenges). This provides a synthetic vision of how 
Embedded systems evolution will be driven by in coming years in a scenario of 
evolution toward System of Systems. All these points are further developed in the 
analysis section.

 Security of information is a high priority and a very strong 
force on the market. In a world where all e-devices are 
interconnected they should ensure confidentiality of data. 
 Safety. Matter of dependability of the system and trust in 
the connectivity chain. 
 Regulations and certification. The role of certification will 
be central to address societal needs. Integration of 
heterogenic domains in terms of regulations is also a major 
force. 
 Complexity: proliferation of devices and distributed 
architecture. The inherent complexity of systems 
(discontinuous, diverse, heterogeneous and distributed 
architectures, proliferation of devices) will be an important 
force on the market. Competition of industry will be based 
on the ability to realize and validate systems as size and 
complexity increase. 
Social – User acceptance Technological 
 Technology adoption and HMI. System of Systems will 
drive new technologies and will require more interoperability 
between humans and Embedded systems. Role of Human 
Machine Interface will be central. 
 Seamless connection needs. We can expect the 
emergence of homogeneous and complete access to 
worldwide information from cars, phones, and homes. This 
highlights the importance of common platforms and 
standards or SOA architecture in order to ensure the 
interoperability of systems. 
 Hardware & Software. Efficient programming of multi-core 
processors, virtualization software, and energy 
management of small devices will support the development 
of large scales systems.

Table 6 specifies for the main sectors integrating Embedded systems the required 
characteristics resulting from the evolution towards System of Systems. This Table is 
based on the inputs of workshop participants and interviewed stakeholders (OEMs 
interviews) as well as on the literature. Grey cell means that the characteristic is a key 
requirement for Embedded systems in the considered sector. 
We indicate the requirements with respect of: 
 Criticality exigencies: safety, security and certifications; 
 Distributed architecture management & autonomy of systems;

4.1.2 Safety and security 
Safety refers to the dependability of the system and to the trust in the fact that no 
serious consequence will occur even in case of failure of the system. Safety 
embraces all Embedded systems applications even if the level of criticality of safety 
varies depending on the applications. Some sectors such as Aerospace and Defense 
have a long and unique experience in Safety. There are more and more safety critical 
systems in transportation and many news areas such as energy, factory automation, 
and medical now share similar evolutions. Safety is an enabler of the market as users 
must trust the value chain of the system. 
Security refers to the security of information in the system. It's about trust in data 
confidentiality and integrity and in the inability to divert the system for other goals than 
those specified by the designer. Security embraces all Embedded systems 
applications when connected with communication systems. Connected Embedded 
systems must ensure confidentiality of data and must be able to face the proliferation 
of security threats and the increasing sophistication of attacks. Moreover the impact 
of missing security on safety can be very serious. Creation and preservation of 
security in Embedded systems are indispensable pre-conditions for the acceptance of 
systems by users. 
The sectors which are operating closely to the consumer market (medical 
equipments, building telecommunications, home electronic equipments, city 
infrastructures…) show that security is a critical exigency. In this context security is an 
enabler of trust for the client and damages caused by the security attack are 
24 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
important. In other sectors even if safety remains the first concern the need of 
protecting the systems from intrusion and attack deliberate or not are growing. 
4.1.3 Distributed architectures and autonomy of systems 
Distributed architectures and autonomy of systems refer to coordinated situation 
assessment and solution strategies across all System of Systems. This addresses 
diverse fields of activity as smart energy grid, consumer life (energy management in 
home, surveillance…), smart cities infrastructure (e.g. Car sharing), patient monitoring 
and coordinated driving to reduce pollution and increase traffic safety, etc… 
Distributed architectures in the context of fixed infrastructure are relatively well 
controlled; for instance SCADA systems (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition), 
Control Command (air traffic control, shipping control, electric dispatching system)… 
[POT2010]. There are many scientific and technological challenges in the 
implementation of distributed architectures of connected Embedded systems and 
more globally of System of Systems. The inherent constraints of Embedded systems 
application (safety, security, energy management…) must be addressed. The 
characteristics of System of Systems (see Garnier and Kopetz) where control is 
distributed and subsystems are autonomous are of key importance. This requires that 
a common operational picture can be established between the acting (semi-
autonomous) sub-systems under real-time conditions in an accurate way, on the 
basis of integrated, heterogeneous, intelligent sensors and static situation awareness, 
such that conflict strategies can be established by coordinated maneuvers in real-time 
[ZVEI2009]. 
Key technological innovations are required in the following areas: 
 Design of large scale distributed architectures; 
 Verification of large scale distributed architectures; 
 System analysis; 
 Distributed control (algorithms). 
Distributed architectures and autonomy of systems characteristic refers to the 
challenges defined by Jean-Luc Garnier on Network and services infrastructure, 
Command and control, and Modeling and simulation of SoS. It is also clearly 
established as a key element by Hermann Kopetz. 
4.1.4 Seamless connection 
Seamless connection refers to all Embedded systems connected to the Web to 
access relevant information in real-time. Applications are rapidly growing more 
specifically on volume market such as smart grid, smart building, monitoring of 
patients, car connectivity, smart shop… In addition to solutions from IT systems, for 
embedded Systems specific technical issues have to be addressed due to the 
inherent constraints and limits of Embedded systems capabilities: computing power, 
memory resources. Furthermore tools for secure authentication have to be 
established (see section 4.1.2 on Safe and secure systems) and innovative 
interaction interfaces have to be build (see Human Machine Interface section 4.1.5). 
Seamless connection characteristic refers to the Seamless connection challenge 
defined by Jean-Luc Garnier. 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 25 
4.1.5 Human Machine Interface 
The Human Machine Interface (HMI) issues are transverse to all sectors (see Table 
6). The user interface ergonomic is a key factor for the acceptance of new Embedded 
systems applications. Examples spread among all sectors from iPhone to Airbus 
cockpit. 
Interviewed stakeholders highlighted two key points as regard the evolution of the 
interaction of user with machines. First, Embedded systems will evolve from one 
device per function to multi-function devices due to the combination of usages on the 
same system; for instance the car infotainment interface combines in-vehicle 
functions (on-board sensors, energy management, audio/video…) and connectivity 
(mobile phone usage, navigation data, apps…) Second, complex technologies are 
more and more transferred to the users; for instance, cars "talk" to human. 
From a consumer point of view this leads to more and more interactions between 
humans and Embedded systems. This requires a reduction of usage/management 
complexity to make the system accepted by the users. 
The issues regarding Human Machine Interfaces are various and spread from 
engineering to social sciences. They revolve around better understanding of people's 
resistance to adoption of new applications, simulation and user models to estimate 
misuse, new multimodal interfaces, for example technologies enhancing user 
interaction such as 3D HMI development tactile interfaces, relevant data presentation, 
multiplatform portability, and sensors integration. 
Human Machine Interface characteristic refers to the challenges defined by Jean-Luc 
Garnier on Human system integration and interface, and Combination of IT and socio-
technical approaches. 
4.1.6 Multi-core architecture and virtualization 
For several years now microprocessor companies manufacture and sell multi-core 
architectures. A multi-core processor includes two or more distinct processor cores in 
order to improve performance, reduce power consumption, and achieve more efficient 
simultaneous processing for multiple tasks. PCs and smart phones have already on 
average more than two cores per system today, and even media tablets are quickly 
migrating to dual and quad core solutions leveraging the scalability of heterogeneous 
architectures. 
Interviewed stakeholders and workshop participants confirmed that the trend towards 
2020 is the use of multi-core platforms in all sectors. This architecture allows a higher 
density of functions on a computer providing increasing capabilities for functions such 
as control and visualization while mastering energy consumption. This also responds 
to the trend of using more general purpose hardware when possible in order to lower 
the cost of systems. To make these solutions even more attractive and get more 
efficient development and use of hardware and software the industry will move to 
increased system integration by implementing software virtualization. Virtualization is 
a key trend in IT datacenters. This trend is emerging in the Embedded systems area 
[CTB2011, INTEL2011]. 
Main scientific and technological issues remain in efficient parallel and heterogeneous 
systems' programming using high abstraction level in order to safely and effectively 
program increasingly complex applications. Thus certification of multi-core systems in 
26 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
critical environment with respect to safety, reliability, and security is not yet possible. 
This will require the following to name a few: 
 Standardized language for parallel programming; 
 Efficient validation and verification methods; 
 Design tool suite for multi-core virtualized architecture enabling safe and secure 
application development; 
 Optimization of algorithms for multi-core computer. 
Multi-core architecture and virtualization characteristic refer to the Virtualization 
challenge defined by Jean-Luc Garnier. 
4.1.7 Energy management 
Pervasive use of devices based on Embedded systems requires to solve the current 
barriers in terms of system lifetime especially for systems which are not connected to 
a power network. Systems must autonomously and reliably operate even for long 
periods of times. In this context overcoming current lifetime barriers is a key enabler 
for the Embedded systems evolution. Furthermore the low power consumption of 
Embedded system will also have an environmental impact considering the 
proliferation of devices: power efficiency of devices must be improved to reduce the 
total energy consumptions of System of Systems. 
Current research explores two main types of solutions [PETRIO2011]: 
 Extremely energy-effective hardware and software which aim at reducing of 2-3 
orders of magnitude current energy consumption. This encompasses various 
technologies such as ultra low power design (e.g. for wireless sensors), low 
energy consumption electronics' for hardware, tools that reduce power/energy 
use; 
 Extensive use of energy harvesting for "battery less" sensors which will enable to 
generate or back into the environment all or part of the energy required to 
operate the system: solar energy, vibratory energy, mechanical energy, thermal 
energy, high frequency energy… Tools are required to manage these multiple 
energy sources on the same system. 
The sectors which are operating under specific constraints of limited energy source 
access (aerospace, communications, healthcare) show that devices of energy 
management are a critical exigency (see Table 6). 
4.1.8 Cooperation and cross domain fertilization 
The proliferation of devices and the evolution of Embedded system evolution toward 
more connectivity and System of Systems tend to create transverse requirements 
across sectors. Table 6 shows that the characteristics of new Embedded systems 
generation are required on most of the sectors. Formerly disconnected industries now 
share similar evolution. However some sectors have long and unique experience in 
Embedded systems development and operation on some specific technologies: By 
way of illustration, Aerospace industry has long experience on safe systems, and 
Defense sector on system engineering. 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 27 
The question of cooperation and cross-fertilization is defined by Jean-Luc Garnier in 
engineering processes and collaborative, life-cycle management and combination of 
IT and socio-technical approaches challenges. It also often came up in the interviews 
and workshop. Stakeholders considered that cooperation between experts of 
Embedded systems technologies and experts of the different application areas 
(health, mobility, energy…) and reinforcement of synergies should be favored. 
Initiatives of cooperation across sectors are already started (see for instance 
Numatec initiative in "Value chain" chapter).

The study team defined a ―reference framework‖ that categorizes and characterizes 
the wide range of tools and methods supporting Embedded system design ESD. We 
use this reference framework as a baseline to define and analyze the technologic, 
scientific and business challenges, and to quantify and forecast the ESD market. 
In order to qualify the scope of the reference framework we first describe the main 
components of Embedded systems and design process, and then characterize the 
different segments of ESD which form the basis of our analysis. 
4.2.1 High-level view of Embedded systems 
The high-level view of an Embedded system (see Figure 1) is extracted from the 
Embedded System Common Technical Baseline (CTB) which is a knowledge 
database built and update by a large community of Embedded systems stakeholders 
[CTB2011]. This provides a Lego-like decomposition of what actually composes an 
Embedded system both hardware and software. As illustrated in the figure the 
hardware node (processors, DSP, FGPA, ASIC) may be considered as interacting 
with the physical world and incorporates set of basic software components such as 
OS, middleware, various drivers, etc.

4.2.1.1  Hardware nodes  
The Common Technical Baseline [CTB2011] indicates that each hardware node: 
 Can be considered as a separate Embedded System; 
 May be implemented on a single chip, or across several chips; 
 May be composed of one or more Processors, DSPs, FPGAs, ASICs, 
peripherals, connected by a Bus or Network; 
 May have software that is shared and coordinated across several Hardware 
Nodes via a Middleware software layer. 
A typical example of Hardware node is the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in the 
automotive industry. An ECU is a MCU-based ICT hardware tailored by embedded 
software which controls one or more electrical subsystems in a vehicle. It is described 
in the study "Is Europe in the driver's seat? The competitiveness of the European 
automotive Embedded systems industry" commissioned by the Information Society 
Unit at the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) and produced 
by iSuppli Corporation [JRCAUTO 2010].  
The JRC's study underlines that since 2010 and beyond, the latest generation of ECU 
design has taken on an appearance that is very similar to the PC environment 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 29 
[JRCAUTO 2010]. Considering the AUTOSAR architecture, the authors of the study 
describe the ECU structure having the following layers: 
 Application layer; 
 Services layer which provides software services from the operating system 
software and the device driver software; 
 ECU abstraction layer which describes the functional capabilities of the ECU; 
 Microcontroller abstraction layer which describes the hardware and software 
characteristics of each type of MCU; 
 Complex driver which represents the non-standard segment in the development. 
The study stresses that with the updated architecture, the industry has created an 
architecture that ‗de-couples‘ the hardware from the software, which is allowing 
developers to add new features without the requirement to re-engineer the hardware.  
The authors of the study conclude with a description of the following factors which 
increase the complexity of automotive Embedded systems [JRCAUTO 2010]:  
 Increasing MCU capabilities due to the advances of semiconductor technology. 
The next step is multiple MCUs on a single chip or so-called multi-core chips. 
Multi-core MCUs are already common in the PC industry and will grow in the 
automotive industry in areas such as ADAS where the computing load can be 
very high. Multi-core MCUs will also be used to merge separate MCUs; 
 Growth of MCUs because more automotive functions are becoming digital 
system that requires a microcomputer. The processing power of each individual 
MCU varies widely, but is typically much lower than current PCs. With future 
trends, the total MCU processing power in a modern vehicle is likely to exceed 
the average PC in terms of processing power; 
 In the past, each MCU was effectively a simple ‗ECU‘ since it would primarily 
operate in a stand-alone mode. As the communication load between ECUs grew, 
system complexity increased, this is particularly the case for software complexity; 
 The growing ECU-ECU communication requirements are changing the ECU 
architecture to a domain structure. The result is fewer ECU systems, with each 
ECU controlled by multiple MCUs, while the number of MCUs is still growing.  
4.2.1.2  Software layers  
An Embedded system integrates the following software layers [CTB2011, POT2010, 
JRCAUTO 2010]: 
 Application software layer, which must use the APIs to be compatible with the 
layered system; 
 Middleware software layer. In a distributed, possibly heterogeneous environment, 
Middleware serves to hide both these aspects by providing uniform, standard, 
high-level interfaces to the application developers and integrators, so that 
applications can be easily composed, reused, ported, and made to interoperate. 
Middleware services provide common services to perform various general 
purpose functions; 
30 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Operating system software layer which is the overall manager of all hardware 
and software aspects of a computer. The OS includes the Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are used by all software components. 
Operating systems for embedded applications are generally (but not always) 
real-time. In some cases, they may allow real-time tasks to co-exist with non-
real-time tasks. 
4.2.2 High-level view of Embedded systems lifecycle management 
As previously described most of Embedded systems work under severe constraints 
such as safety, security, energy management, performance. In this context the control 
of both architecture of hardware node and of their software and tools to implement 
and effectively execute the application is a key issue. These two technologies – 
hardware and software – are implemented in highly nested way in the process of 
designing an Embedded system. The dependency of hardware and software design 
is illustrated by the following figure issued by the CTB [CTB2011].

4.2.3 Scope of the ESD Reference Framework of the study 
In this section we define the reference framework which will be used by the study 
team as a baseline to define and analyze the technologic, scientific and business 
challenges, and to quantify and forecast the ESD market. The IDC taxonomy is the 
basis of the reference framework that allows the study team to use all IDC data in 
order to forecast the market evolution [IDC2010-22]. This point is explained in the 
"Tracking Methodology" section of the chapter entitled "The ESD Software Market 
Size". In order to demonstrate the reliability of reference framework we specify the 
correlation between it and the CTB taxonomy. 
The reference framework defines 6 categories of software tools which support the 
design of Embedded systems: 
 Application Development Software; 
 Change and Configuration Management Software; 
32 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Automated Software Quality; 
 PLM software; 
 Electronic design automation (EDA) software; 
 Content management software. 
4.2.3.1  Applicat ion Development Software  
IDC defines the application development software as including software, tools, and 
development environments used by developers to create Embedded systems 
applications. 
This category matches with the 3 first stacks of the category "Software Development 
defined in the Lifecycle view of the CTB (see Figure 3). The fourth stack "Software 
verification" of the CTB is defined as such by the "Automated Software Quality" 
category of the reference framework (see below). 
Application development software category includes the following development tools: 
 Development languages and environments tools. These tools encompass 
integrated development environments with visual interfaces as well as rapid 
application development tools and environments, higher-level languages, and 
component based development tools. It also includes the tools that help 
automate various aspects of developing applications from components and within 
component framework environments; 
 Software construction components. They are functionally specific software 
subassemblies and libraries sold apart from a programming development 
environment that may be designed for use with a specific programming 
development environment. Software components that fall into this category are 
intended to be used by developers to assemble applications; 
 Business rules management systems (BRMSs). They are discrete systems that 
define, manage, and execute conditional logic in concert with other processes 
and actions. BRMSs are well known for their ability to automatically recognize the 
inter-rule relationships that evolve as rules are added or changed, thereby 
eliminating the need for the careful and complex rule sequencing and conflict 
resolution that would otherwise be necessary; 
 Model-driven development (MDD) software. Model-driven development (MDD) 
software is an abstract software development process that supports the 
understanding and definition of objects and relationships rendered as a 
specification. MDD is centered on five design principles: abstraction, model 
centricity, implementation independence, round-trip engineering, and the 
automation of selected application and system artifacts. Model-driven 
development software encompasses four categories of modeling tools: data 
modeling, process modeling, business process modeling, and simulation. 
The following are the vendors tracked by IDC to evaluate the application development 
software market for Embedded systems: Atego, Empress Software, Enea, Esterel 
Technologies, Fujitsu, Green Hills Software, HP, IBM, Infragistics Corp., Innovations 
Software Technology, Insoft Oy, Intel Corp., Mathworks, Mentor Graphics, MetaCase, 
Microsoft, NEC, QNX Software Systems, Siemens, Sybase, and Sparx Systems. 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 33 
4.2.3.2  Automated Software Qual ity  
IDC defines the automated software quality (ASQ) tools as tools for supporting 
software unit testing and system testing; they also support software quality 
assurance. Functions such as test specification, generation, execution, results 
analysis, test and QA management, ASQ SaaS and testing as a service, and virtual 
test lab management as well as software quality analysis and measurement are 
included in this category. 
This category matches with the fourth stack "Software verification" of the category 
"Software Development" defined in the Lifecycle view of the CTB (see Figure 3). 
The following are the vendors tracked by IDC to evaluate the automated software 
quality tools market for Embedded systems: Coverity, Empirix, GrammaTech Inc., 
HP, IBM, Intel Corp., Klocwork, Mathworks, Microsoft, Parasoft, Quest Software, 
Sparx Systems, and TechExcel Inc. 
4.2.3.3  Change and Conf igurat ion Management Software  
The change and configuration management software functional tools cover 
management of hardware and software assets. Software for planning, tracking, and 
applying system hardware and software changes is also included, as is software 
distribution, hardware and software discovery and inventory, license management,

4.3.1 Twelve priority research areas 
In order to define the scientific and technological priorities in the evolution of 
Embedded systems towards System of Systems each of the required characteristics 
as defined in the first section of this chapter was qualified with respect to the ESD 
reference framework defined in the section above. 
Due to strong links between in some characteristics (safety and security for instance) 
we consider six main characteristics which are of a critical importance for the 
evolution of Embedded systems: 
 Criticality exigencies – safety, security and certifications; 
 Distributed architecture and autonomy of systems; 
 Seamless connection; 
 Human Machine Interface; 
 Multi-core architecture and virtualization; 
 Energy management. 
In order to provide a clear vision of what is at stake in the ESD areas the reference 
framework is simplified to its two main components 
 Software Development Tools is a macro category encompassing: Application 
Development Software, Change and Configuration Management Software, 
Automated Software Quality; 
 PLM Tools is a macro category encompassing: PLM software, Electronic design 
automation (EDA) software, Content management software. 
Engineering processes and collaborative, life-cycle management, and Modeling and 
simulation are key challenges defined by Jean-Luc Garnier. They are also clearly 
established as a key elements by Hermann Kopetz. 
The framework analysis presented below leads to identify twelve priority areas of 
scientific and technological research which are aligned with the context of evolution of 
Embedded systems towards System of Systems and which comply with the ESD 
definition. Table 7 presents the conclusion of the analysis.

5.1.1 Methodology 
IDC's research methodology for the Embedded systems market encompasses 
qualitative and quantitative methods to study the market from the top-down and from 
the bottom-up perspective. 
The top-down perspective emphasizes data gathering from major microprocessor IP 
companies, major MPU and SoC suppliers, and major embedded software vendors. 
IP vendors include ARM, MIPS, Imagination Technologies, and Tensilica. Embedded 
MPU and SoC suppliers include Freescale, Intel, IBM, Applied Micro, Broadcom, 
Marvell, Renesas, TI, Qualcomm, Sigma Design, Sony, Core Logic, NXP, Toshiba, 
Fujitsu, Cavium Networks, NetLogic, Tilera, LSI, Samsung, Mediatek, MStar, Oracle, 
ST Microelectronics, Infineon, PMC-Sierra, and others. Embedded Software vendors 
include Microsoft, Wind River, Greenhills, Montevista, QNX, Enea, and others. 
The top-down research includes surveys targeted toward gathering trends, insight on 
target markets, pricing, road maps, and actual shipments/ASPs/revenue. Data was 
gathered to determine the total number of volumes shipped in 2010. Interviews were 
conducted to build assumptions in order to support forecasts through 2015. 
The bottom-up approach ties existing system forecasts to MPU usage ratios and 
penetration of architectures. Using device ASVs enables checks on MPU and SoC 
ASVs and overall costs and spending on systems. Embedded MPU and SoC data 
were then further segmented by processor architecture — x86, Power Architecture, 
MIPS, ARM, SuperH, and others; bus width — <32, 32, 64, and >=128; and 
component type — standalone processors, ASSPs (SoCs), and ASICs (SoCs). 
Embedded processor and systems data were then further analyzed to size the 
intelligent systems market and establish single and multi-core shipment estimates 
through the forecast period. 
5.1.2 Embedded systems vertical markets – Forecasts 
Embedded systems accounted for almost €852 billion of value in 2010. The overall 
industry is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% throughout the 
forecast period and should reach €1,5 trillion in revenue by 2015. This is growing not 
only at a faster pace than traditional IT spending but also more than 1.5 times faster 
than the overall semiconductor industry. 
Table 10 provides the IDC overall revenue forecasts of the Embedded systems 
market segmented by major industry, including capturing the value of 
telecommunication and mobile phones. Table 11 is a description of the model's 
segmentation.

In the following sections we focus our description of drivers and illustration on sectors 
which have a strong European industry leadership (section "OEMs" in chapter "Value 
chain analysis") namely: 
 The Automotive and Aerospace sectors as example of traditional Embedded 
systems markets which are now moving toward connectivity and System of 
Systems; 
 The Healthcare and Energy sectors representing emerging markets for 
Embedded systems. 
5.1.3 Embedded systems in Automotive – Drivers and illustration 
Today, as much as 25% for the vehicle cost is in Embedded systems components 
(hardware, software and services). The ratio is the fast growing as 80% of product 
innovation including Embedded systems. 
As regard the Embedded system design, one of the main challenges is to manage the 
increasing complexity which is driven by the increasing functional scope 
encompassing functions. The typical car in Europe currently has about 65 MCU-
based systems, with high-end luxury vehicles having well over 100 MCUs 
[JRCAUTO201] with more than 950 signal paths [INTEL2011]. In addition, the 
complexity of Embedded systems is growing due to the connectivity of systems and 
their interactions which in return highly increase the cost of development. 
In order to cope with the shorter life cycle of product and cost constraints the industry 
focuses on modularity of components and high reuse across product lines, and on 
highly controlled functional integration and concentration on innovation with novel 
functions. 
 The reuse of technology relies on standards and communities such as 
AUTOSAR for specifications, and Genivi for implementations; 
 The pathway for innovation is to concentrate on innovations for high level models 
of vehicle and implementation of stored/ imported process and development 
achievements on lower range of vehicle. 
5.1.4 Embedded systems in Aerospace – Drivers and illustration 
Today, 7% to 12% in civil avionic costs is in Embedded systems components 
(hardware, software and services). Up to 35% of R&D cost is in Embedded systems. 
By way of illustration, the Airbus 380 comprise 400km of wiring harness connecting 
60 0000 signal interfaces, and requires some 450MB embedded software for flight-
control applications [AIRBUS]. The overall embedded software accounts for 100 
Million Lines of software code representing tens of Millions of work hours and cost 
100 € per Single Line of certified level A software Code. 
Top Challenges for Embedded systems in civil avionic are the following: 
 Develop the right architectures to enable easy maintenance and upgrade of 
hardware and software components in short cycles, all along the life time of the 
aircraft; 
 Manage the increasing complexity of multi-source software particularly anticipate 
the sharing of distributed resources to support multiple functions; 
44 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Maintain the very high level of security and safety already achieved on existing 
products, with increasing functionality; 
 Assure very high level of maturity at entry into service, in spite of a sophisticated 
industrialization process and a distributed supply chain; 
 Reduce the cost of development of certified software, in terms of lead time and 
cost of the nominal design cycle, and in terms of effort and time required for re-
validation and re-certification after change; 
 Maintain the embedded software. The durability and evolution of Embedded 
systems and of their development environments have to be managed while life 
cycles are shorter. For example, the microprocessor used on the A320 had a 20 
years life cycle, the one uses on the A380 IMA lasts 5 years. A second important 
challenge is to master the increasing complexity of systems. More and more 
functions are software implemented and standard market microprocessors are 
more and more used. The coexistence of complementary technologies (micro-
nano technologies and power electronics) must be controlled. The industry must 
also integrate the ―human factor‖ dimension either in the design methods or in 
system exploitation. 
The trends in software development approach are driven by model driven 
approaches, automatic Code Generation, but main breakthroughs are expected from 
verification processes, methods and tools (Formal Methods such as Static Analysis). 
Other improvements axes are around standardization, composition, incremental 
design and certification. 
5.1.5 Embedded systems in Healthcare – Drivers and illustration 
Healthcare systems encompass a broad range of technologies that facilitate the 
remote delivery of healthcare services. Rapid advancements in information and 
telecommunications technologies are making healthcare systems more accessible to 
a broad range of healthcare organizations and consumers in terms of cost, ease of 
use, and distribution. Meanwhile, healthcare reform, an aging population, and an 
increased focus on managing chronic conditions also add to the push for healthcare 
systems. 
Challenges to this market are not primarily technology based. The technologies for 
connecting devices to each other and to the Internet are well developed and their 
limitations well understood. New connectivity technologies are always emerging to 
improve on criteria such as throughput, range, security, and quality of service, but 
existing technologies are more than sufficient for many healthcare systems. Rather, 
inhibitors to the healthcare systems are either indirectly related to the technology or 
external to the devices themselves. Top challenges for Embedded systems in 
healthcare systems include: 
 Declining costs and increasing power of consumer device technologies. 
Declining costs will put these devices within reach for mainstream retail 
consumers. Increased power means that tasks currently reserved for institutional 
devices could be delivered in consumer form factors; 
 Standardization in technology ecosystem to speed-up time to market of new 
devices at lower costs. With networking and connectivity technologies largely 
standardized, costs of components, software development, and implementation 
all have fallen significantly and will likely continue to fall. Many healthcare 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 45 
systems deal with fairly low data volumes and, so, will not require the most 
advanced networking technologies, further reducing costs; 
 Human factors engineering: Healthcare systems in end-user devices require high 
degrees of reliability and usability. These solutions need to accommodate a 
broad range of use scenarios and users who may have a wide variety of medical 
conditions that limit their physical and cognitive capacities; 
 Issues such as privacy, security, customer service, and device diagnostics (e.g., 
troubleshooting) all tend to be more delicate with e-Health solutions than in other 
end-user consumer device market; 
 Complexity of installation and customization: Customization and complexity tend 
to go hand in hand with consumer devices. With healthcare systems, vendors will 
want to limit the decisions and options of end users to a narrow set of choices to 
reduce the possibility of user error. At the same time, vendors will need to be 
able to customize their devices to accommodate a broad range of usage 
scenarios, ranging from a home to a variety of institutional settings. 
5.1.6 Embedded systems in Energy – Drivers and illustration 
5.1.6.1  Smart  gr id/Uti l i t ies  
The past 10 years have seen the proliferation of much smarter devices on the grid — 
operational technology. Devices that support real-time operations — programmable 
logic controllers (PLCs), distributed computing systems (DCS), intelligent electronic 
devices (IEDs), smart remote terminal units (RTUs), intelligent sensing devices, and 
SCADA systems — are incorporating computing in the field and two-way 
communications between these IP-addressable devices for distributed or centralized 
control. 
The electric meter's total installed base in Europe will exceed 53 million meters by the 
end of the year. The full-scale deployment of the intelligent grid is still some way off, 
but projects, key pilots, and implementation are ongoing, especially in grid operation 
and usage optimization. Utilities will ramp up energy efficiency and demand-response 
pilot programs, and will increase investments in technologies that enable these 
programs, including home/building energy management solutions. The drivers 
include: 
 Renewable, distributed generation, and clean technologies: The achievement of 
the 20% binding renewable target requires continued investment in generation 
capacity and in the distribution of the energy to customers. Wind will remain a 
leading source among, while solar power installed capacity will steadily increase. 
Smart grids will facilitate the inclusion of renewable energy sources into the 
system and provide a platform for G4V; 
 Electric Vehicles (EVs): The fleet trials in the EU (there are around 16 of them) 
will gather real-world use-based information (e.g., EV efficiencies, charging 
profiles). New business models will be tested; 
 Smart gas metering: Advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) pilots are taking place 
to prepare for longer-term rollout. Business case analysis will be carefully 
analyzed by utilities and national regulators. Some costs may be saved if gas can 
be rolled out at the same time as electricity, but: 
 Countries vary greatly in terms of their gas coverage; 
46 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Distribution companies for gas and electricity may be different; 
 Distribution areas may not be the same; 
 Smart water metering: Despite a scarcity of clean water and availability of new 
technology, ICT innovation deployment in the water segment is not be 
comparable to that in electricity. More investments are expected in the next two 
to three years. Initial technology deployments will mimic electric and gas utility 
investments by focusing on smart meters, two-way communication networks, and 
analytics. Early implementations of sensors and networks are expected for water 
basin management. Industry fragmentation will continue to be the biggest 
challenge. 
5.1.6.2  Smart  Bui ld ing  
IDC defines a Smart Building (SB) system as a set of intelligent technologies that 
enable the building owner/manager to measure, monitor, control, and optimize the 
operations and maintenance of a building. 
The primary focus of most SB systems is energy management. However, these 
systems differ dramatically from conventional energy conservation efforts. The four 
principles of these next-generation systems are: 
 Automation: The sensor network and the controls with which it is connected are 
highly automated. Thus, outside of the initial setting phase of the system, there is 
little need for any human hand to physically turn things on or off; 
 Non-intrusion: Unlike earlier efforts to encourage energy conservation, SB 
systems focus on waste eradication as opposed to reducing comfort to save 
energy; 
 Persistence: SBs are adaptive and are in constant communication with their 
sensors and the outside world. Thus they tend to have a very long period of time 
during which energy savings persist; 
 High ROI: Building owners are traditionally hesitant to make capital investments 
in their properties without the possibility of a high return on investment (ROI). 
Payback periods for such capital equipment purchases must usually be kept 
below two years in the buildings market. Most new SB systems have an ROI that 
is at or near that extremely high target. 
Traditional Building Automation Systems (BAS) do little more than turn on and off 
machines at preset intervals. The new generation of systems, which we refer to as SB 
systems, can control subsystems on a finely calibrated scale and also respond to 
external feedbacks such as wholesale electricity prices and weather forecasts. IDC 
believes that SB systems are an emerging high growth market that has tremendous 
disruptive potential for the energy industries. IDC estimates that the SB systems 
market will be growing at a 27% CAGR over the next five years. 
Just as the smart grid is changing the way electricity is being delivered from the 
power plant to the meter, the SB will change how we consume that energy, using less 
of it more efficiently.

This chapter quantifies the market of the ESD packaged software revenue. 
Worldwide packages software revenues are divided by geographic area – Europe, 
North America, Asia/Pacific, and Rest of the World – and into technological 
segments. Packages software revenues and geographic area are defined in the 
sections below. The technological segments are those defined in the Reference 
Framework. 
5.2.1 Tracking Methodology for ESD Market estimates 
5.2.1.1  Software package  
IDC uses the term packaged software to distinguish commercially available software 
from custom software. Packaged software is programs or code sets of any type 
commercially available through sale, lease, or rental, or as a service. Total packaged 
software revenue is defined as license revenue plus maintenance revenue plus 
subscription and other software revenue. It is primarily the total packaged software 
revenue that is further allocated to markets, geographic areas, and operating 
environments. In addition to total packaged software revenue, IDC collects software 
license revenue, software maintenance revenue, subscription and other software–
related revenue, and total company revenue (see Figure 4): 
 License revenue includes revenue collected for software licenses, either limited 
term (lease) or perpetual, that include licenses for new installations of a software 
product, licenses for additional software options, changes to existing licenses 
permitting more users or more computer system resources to be used by the 
licensed software. 
License revenue does not include license maintenance revenue, which typically 
includes fees covering version upgrades, the automatic delivery of bug fixes and 
patches, and basic telephone support, all of which are normally delivered during a 
fixed, renewable term of service. 
 Maintenance revenue consists of fees charged for continuous improvement of 
the software by repairing known faults and errors and/or enhancing and updating 
the product, as well as for technical support; 
 Subscription/other software revenue consist of fees to use software products 
and to receive maintenance and support for those software products for a limited 
period of time. Subscriptions consist of bundled software and services where the 
fair value of the license fee is not separately determinable from 
maintenance/support. 
Packaged software revenue excludes service revenue derived from training, 
consulting, and systems integration that is separate from the right-to use license but 
does include the implicit value of software included in a service that offers software 
functionality by a different pricing scheme (as described directly below in more detail).

5.2 .1 .2  IDC's software vendors '  database  
IDC's software research programs maintain a centralized database that includes 
worldwide total packaged software revenue for nearly 1,000 software vendors. IDC 
does not contend that this is an exhaustive list of software providers; in fact, we 
believe there are more than 10,000 such suppliers. However, the IDC database is 
designed to support very precise forecasting, and the suppliers in the database 
represent a majority of the software market's revenue overall and a majority of the 
revenue in each of the various segmentations it supports. The revenue is allocated to 
functional market segments, geographic areas, revenue types, industries, channels, 
and operating environments. The functional software markets defined by the 
taxonomy represent a collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive view of the 
worldwide software marketplace. 
The ESD market estimates were elaborated ad hoc for this study based on ongoing 
IDC's calculations on the main market segments as defined in the Reference 
Framework of the study. Specifically, IDC collects data on revenues associated to the 
Application Development Software, on Automated Software Quality, Change and 
Configuration Management, Product Life-cycle Management applications, Electronic 
Design Automation software and Content Management software and their respective 
ESD part. 
5.2.1.3  Geographical  scope  
Defined areas are Europe, North America, Asia/Pacific, and Rest of the World. 
 In this report, the designation Europe stands for the major countries of European 
Union member states and refers collectively to the 19 member states: Austria, 
Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, 
Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, 
Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Europe, as defined, covers 98% of EU 
GDP; 
 North Americas includes the United States and Canada; 
 Asia/Pacific includes Australia, China (PRC), Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, 
Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, 
Vietnam, and Thailand; 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 49 
 Rest of the World includes Latin America countries (Brazil, Venezuela, 
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico), other European countries, and Middle 
East and Africa countries. 
5.2.2 ESD Packaged Software Revenues 
As Table 12 shows, the worldwide market for Embedded System Development 
Packaged Software was worth about €3.31 billion in 2010. The ESD Packaged 
software market was less heavily affected by the worldwide economic downturn than 
most other IT markets. 
IDC forecasts that the worldwide market for ESD Packaged software will expand at a 
healthy 7.1% compound annual growth rate to surpass €6.5 billion in 2020.

These tables show that globalization may open new markets for Embedded systems. 
ESD European players can now reach into BRIC countries since those markets 
cannot rely on their own Embedded systems providers.

However, if competition from the USA is a long standing threat it has now been 
increased by competition from BRIC countries in particular. According to interviewed 
stakeholders it is expected that by 2020-2040 basic know-how will have reached 
European and US levels in BRIC countries. BRIC countries are currently on the way 
to overtake Europe academically on Embedded Systems engineering (Singapore, 
China). 
5.2.4 ESD Packaged Software Revenues by technological segments 
The following Table splits the total ESD Packaged software market in the six 
technological segments defined in the reference framework. 
Table 15 details the ESD Packaged software market forecast shown in Table 1 with 
the sub-segments revenues categories. 
PLM is the biggest market and accounts for over half the market while Automated 
Software Quality and Content Management categories to undergo the fastest growth

5.2.4.1  Product  L ifecycle  management (PLM)  
Interviewed stakeholders indicate that the traditional heterogeneous and fragmented 
product lifecycle management environment, even when compromised of excellent 
tools, is unable to provide the level of visibility, manageability, and fidelity of decision 
making required. The growing complexity and sophistication of Embedded systems 
design and engineering coupled with global supply chain and manufacturing 
operations in some sectors such as automotive, require a new level of capabilities to 
ensure quality while reducing costs and time to market. 
By way of illustration, BMW recently acquired V6 solution of Dassault Systems as did 
Aston Martin with the Siemens' NX CAD software. BMW's project aims at 
implementing a complete environment to manage the Electrical & Electronic (E/E) 
design process. BMW intends to use V6 in order to create master reference E/E 
architecture. This model will guide customer requirements to implementable functions 
— defining the logical architecture components, and managing hardware and 
software implementation. 
OEMs are migrating to a design and manufacturing environment capable of 
supporting a global platform strategy. This environment must be standard based and 
open in order to facilitate a single source of all data for design, manufacturing, and 
supply chain processes across vehicle design and manufacturing programs. This 
approach encourages design reuse, further reducing design time, cost and risk. 
As a consequences OEMs tend to forge stronger relationships with a small number of 
PLM vendors based on their ability to articulate a long-term vision combined with 
deep industry knowledge and a credible product road map. These relationships will 
help OEMs to execute a rigorous global platform strategy and, at the same time, help 
PLM vendors to focus on addressing the industry's critical needs. 
In addition OEMs move to incorporate visual information in many areas of product 
related decisions. Visual information is critical to multi-disciplinary design evaluation 
especially in the System of Systems domain. 
5.2.4.2  Applicat ion software development tools  
Software enables Embedded systems product innovation increasingly. All interviewed 
stakeholders see software monetized in "smart" devices all of which drive competitive 
growth and agility for product manufacturers. At the same time, the embedded 
applications create new issues for software life-cycle management in areas such as 
testing and change management. While software is driving competitive success the 
lack of efficient approaches to embedded software life-cycle management also place 
manufacturers at risk. 
In addition, we are observing the rise of Systems of Systems — where software 
embedded in products interacts with and drives additional transactions with systems 
based elsewhere — creating additional, quality, security, safety, and other risks. New 
constraints such as immediate consumer uptake of mobile applications or complex 
sourcing (including use of open source) drive increase chances for massive failure. 
With the explosion of Embedded systems connectivity, there has yet to be effective 
and appropriate levels of quality management, change management, and security put 
in place. 
As a result of untenable reputation, safety, and application stability risks, a key market 
driver will be a significant increase in demand for products, processes, and strategies 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 53 
that enable combined, mature approaches to product life-cycle management that 
encompass the strength of capabilities of long-term "traditional" application life-cycle 
management approaches. 
5.2.4.3  Automated Software Qual ity  
IDC expects significant growth of the ASQ market as software innovation drives 
Embedded system product innovation and as large OEMs companies must deal with 
significant technology, business, and global complexity and competition. Key areas of 
challenge for innovation investment include: 
 Confluence of quality and security and creation of better processes for security 
early in the life cycle cut costs and risk significantly; 
 Coordination between requirements and testing as well as incorporating agile, 
iterative approaches to quality to support agile development; 
 End-user experience testing and coordination with application performance 
management. 
5.2.4.4  Change and Conf igurat ion Management Software  
The rise of Embedded systems over billions of devices to the network edge, and the 
high degree of innovation and competition make change a permanent feature of the 
design environment. 
At its core, the software fault that led to the loss of the Ariane 5 rocket was a 
configuration management problem. The rocket included a software module intended 
for a previous design, that should never have been aboard and active [CTB2011]. 
5.2.4.5  Electronic design automation (EDA)  
The shorter cycle of new technology, and cost reduction will drive the demand for 
EDA software in the coming decade. The simulation and verification applications that 
reduce the time to reconfigure hardware representation, especially in complicated 
System on a Chip (SoC) designs, are expected to remain in demand. System on a 
Chip devices technology will gain importance due to the reduction in size of consumer 
electronics products and the push toward smarter products. 
5.2.4.6  Content Management  
Drivers for the growth of the content management market include compliance, the 
desire to improve information worker productivity, and the need to optimize 
document-intensive business processes.

We organized our analysis of the stakeholders‘ interviews inputs in three sections. 
The first section deals with "OEMs" and the vision of the European competitiveness at 
the end of the value chain. Then the ―Strategic partners‖ section puts the light on the 
importance of privileged links between actors all along the value chain. To address 
specifically the software industry, the ―Suppliers‖ section focuses on software 
company profiles, manufactured technologies and the coupling with R&D. 
 
6 . 2  O E M s  
OEMs include companies which integrate Embedded systems in their products. They 
are the last part of the value chain between final markets and software suppliers, 
component and sub-systems suppliers, upstream. 
To understand the importance of the OEMs on the value chain, we compare the 
relative position of large European OEMs companies as regards their R&D total 
expenses to their counterparts in the US, Japan and BRIC regions by sectors 
(Source: EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard). The data presented in Table 16 
add up the R&D investment of the top 1400 World companies investing the largest 
sums in R&D. The data collected come from the companies‘ latest published 
accounts, i.e. the 2009 fiscal year accounts and indicate the R&D invested by 
companies' own funds, independently of the location of the R&D activity. 
Europe benefits from strong OEMs base on Automotive and Aerospace & Defense 
sectors… but also from smaller markets such as Electricity/Gas/Water utilities, and 
Energy Equipment. Stakeholder interviews inputs indicate that OEMs drive the 
innovation and technology development. In emergent software applications close 
collaboration between OEMs and Software vendor companies is considered critical to 
develop first products. In this context OEMs create a strong internal market for the 
SMEs. This is particularly important for small software companies which have mainly 
local operations and few international capabilities (see section dedicated to Software 
vendors). By way of illustration, the automotive standard AUTOSAR is an example of 
common agreement between major end-users and OEMs. AUTOSAR now has the 
capability to structure an ecosystem of Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers.

Interviewed players insisted on the power of networking and interactions between 
companies to generate innovations. In this section we address different level of 
interactions from client/suppliers in the value chain to R&D clusters. 
Most of the interviewees think that EU players need to join forces. Better cooperation 
based on collaborative working and sharing between large OEMs companies and 
technology providers accelerate the product innovation on both sides. Local cluster 
experiences in Germany, France and the UK demonstrate that cooperation must be 
across industries/sectors but also with innovation-thirsty emerging markets in order to 
facilitate cross-domain fertilization and to enable to leverage certain investments such 
as validation and testing to minimize liability and cost. This cooperation aims at 
facilitating the creation of a standard and hence harmonizes process development 
standards in the ecosystem. 
French and German clusters are described in Annexes A and B along with the UK 
initiatives (Annexes C). Their model and organization are briefly described in Table 
17. By coordinating business focus research projects clusters provide a regional 
support network for SMEs through cooperation between academia and large OEMs 
industry. This cooperation is considered by the interviewed stakeholders to be now 
well established in most of the clusters. 
Collaboration initiatives between regional clusters are undertaken in order to increase 
the competitiveness of the clusters and their efficiency through the coordination of 
research projects encompassing members of all clusters involved in the initiatives. 
For instance, the System@tic Paris region cluster has signed a partnership with the 
German cluster SafeTRANS and the French cluster Aerospace Valley in the field of 
embedded security systems in transport within the framework of EICOSE (European 
Institute for Complex Embedded Systems Engineering). EICOSE is the first ARTEMIS 
Innovation Cluster on Transportation. Another partnership with the Dutch cluster 
Point-One focusing on Embedded systems and micro-nano technologies is being 
developed.

Europe is seen by interviewed stakeholders to have established a successful model 
of investing in research projects and coordinating the research and innovation 
activities in the area of ESD with governmental support available (national, 
international). Most of the interviewees collaborate in European Projects. They 
recognize that the EU coordination of projects through FPs is a great opportunity to 
create a temporary ecosystem giving access to partners and to technologies which 
are beneficial for the entire European ecosystem by sharing risk and benefits. 
Interviewed stakeholders said that when successful the EU research projects enable 
long lasting strategic partnerships and provide basic research to feed technological 
prototypes. 
However interviewed stakeholders said that the return on investment for companies 
can be unclear and it has been seen that research programs (funded programs) do 
not go into production (i.e. back to industry). The reasons explaining why some 
projects fail are because they involve players from multiple countries and are 
therefore very difficult to manage particularly when players have different agendas 
and conflicting interests – these ecosystems are dissolved as soon as the project 
ends – or just because the aim of the research program was unclear and the result is 
of no use to industrials. 
The EU research organization is also considered to be a good place to share results, 
opinions and ideas which feed the research and innovation activity of the ecosystem. 
The interviewed stakeholders often cited the ARTIST and ARTIST 2 Networks of 
Excellence as having played a key role in the structuring, developing and promoting 
the European research in Embedded Systems. 
A missing partner was identified in the innovation value chain. Most of the interviewed 
stakeholders, more specifically those working in Research and Software vendor 
organizations, noted that overall the Venture Capitalists (VCs) community is not 
widely present and actively involved in European Embedded systems ecosystems. 
The software industry notes that there is a gap to fill between the innovation 
generated in research centers and the development of industrial products. The 
coverage of different steps in order to develop and expand the technology and 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 59 
convert research into a product is not well supported along the innovation cycle. The 
cycle lasts on average 6-8 years including experimentation/validation, support of early 
adopters and ecosystem support. Some interviewed stakeholders pointed out that 
there is a lack of funding for start-up companies which struggle because the time to 
market – from research to product – is long: there is a need of financing to bridge the 
gap between demonstrations and actual commercialization of the products, and then 
big funding keeps being necessary to address the global market. This missing 
mechanism is a first step in the explanation of why so few software vendors manage 
to the critical size. The generation of start-ups and small software companies is also 
seen as a weak point by market players as it is discussed in the following section. 
 
6 . 4  S u p p l y  s i d e  
This section deals with the organization of the supply side industry. A special focus is 
made on the ESD software vendor ecosystem. We define European ESD providers 
as companies with headquarters and R&D based in Europe. To be defined by the 
study team as a provider of ESD solutions, vendors' software should offer any of the 
following core functions: 
 Application Development Software; 
 Change and Configuration Management Software; 
 Automated Software Quality; 
 PLM software; 
 Electronic design automation (EDA) software; 
 Content management software. 
As Table 18 indicates, Software revenues of European ESD providers in 2010 
amounted to 832 €M and represented 25% of the 2010 software revenues of 
worldwide ESD providers. IDC estimates that there are about 430 European ESD 
software vendors employing 9,000 full time equivalent employees.

The supply side of the ESD software market is very fragmented (see Table 19). IDC 
estimates that there are no more than 20 companies with turnover over 10M€ which 
account to nearly the three quarters of the market. Dassault Systèmes and 
SiemensPLM are the two largest companies. These companies are briefly described 
in the following sections. The following are the vendors tracked by IDC which enter in 
60 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
the Top 20 of European ESD companies: ABB, Atego, Enea, Esterel Technologies, 
Invensys, LMS international, SDL international. 
Almost 95% of European ESD software vendors account just for 27% of the market. 
The activity of these small sized companies (turnover below 10M€) relies mostly on 
local operations. By way of illustration, surveys conducted in France [SYNTEC2009] 
and Germany [BITKOM2009] demonstrated that about 75% of small sized embedded 
software vendors operates only in their country while 15% extends their operations to 
Europe.

According to interviewed stakeholders, more specifically the interviewed OEMs, the 
competition is global and favors global and large software vendors who are able to 
compete in global market. The mains reasons are the following: 
 Large ESD software vendors can set de facto standards for the industry and take 
position on the market; 
 To be successful software vendors need to reach a certain size that allows them 
to be considered in RFPs of large industrials who tend to work with well-
established companies that become preferred suppliers leaving little room for 
SMEs and new players. As seen in the OEMs section the customer base is most 
often concentrated and a small number of large OEMs (customers) drive the 
market in several industries. These large OEMs choose preferred suppliers with 
a proven track record and financial stability; 
 Strong suppliers must be developed in the most demanding and breakthrough 
technologies in order to address the emerging market requirement and compete 
with the right technological capacity. It is about simulation and SoS engineering, 
applications for multi-core technologies, virtualization solutions for Embedded 
systems, security, innovative app stores.

6.4.1 Dassault Systèmes 
Dassault Systèmes is the worldwide leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management 
solutions. IDC estimates Dassault Systèmes' worldwide PLM revenues for 2010 at 
$1,882 billion (12,5% market share) [IDC2010-17]. Dassault Systèmes addresses 
more than 11 5000 customers in 80 countries. The Dassault Systèmes portfolio 
consists of: 
 CATIA for designing the virtual product; 
 SolidWorks for 3D mechanical design; 
 DELMIA for virtual production; 
 SIMULIA for virtual testing; 
 ENOVIA for global collaborative lifecycle management; 
 3DVIA for online 3D lifelike experiences. 
6.4.1.1  Embedded system s engineering st rategy  
Dassault Systèmes' strategy centers on the entire process of cross-functional 
simulation and testing in CATIA, integrated tightly with ENOVIA, SIMULIA, and 
DELMIA, to provide a requirements, functional, logical, and physical (RFLP) design–
based tracking of the product across its life cycle. 
In this perspective Dassault Systèmes acquired Geensoft in 2010 to enhance its V6 
portfolio in the Embedded systems area. Geensoft expands the Dassault Systèmes 
product portfolio by adding the capacity to model and generate the entire vehicle 
control software system, allowing a validation loop by connecting the physical 
equipment with the digital mock up. 
6.4.1.2  Customer 's example:  BMW Selected V6 for  Electr ica l ,  
Electronics and Embedded Software Developme nt 
In February 2011, Dassault Systèmes announced that BMW selected ENOVIA V6 
PLM solutions to develop the future electrical, electronics, and embedded software 
(E/E) architecture of BMW cars. 
BMW's Architecture, Integration and Design for Automotive (AIDA) Project aims at 
implementing a complete environment to manage the E/E design process. BMW 
intends to use V6 in order to create master reference E/E architecture, including 
variants and options. This model will guide customer requirements to implementable 
functions — defining the logical architecture components, and managing hardware 
and software implementation. 
The realization of a master E/E architecture will help BMW to streamline the 
engineering process and increase the confidence in design decisions. Of particular 
importance is that this approach encourages design reuse, further reducing design 
time, cost and risk. 
This contract is an indication that major manufacturers seek to forge strong long-term 
relationships with PLM vendors. With the selection of V6, BMW and Dassault 
Systèmes announced a 10-year partnership. 
62 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
6.4.2 Siemens PLM 
Siemens PLM Software (formerly UGS: it was acquired by Siemens on 2007 for about 
$3.5 billion) is a 7600-employees company specializing in 3D & 2D Product Lifecycle 
Management (PLM) software. The company is a business unit of Siemens Industry 
Automation division, and it is headquartered in Plano, Texas. Siemens PLM is the 
third PLM solutions vendor worldwide. IDC estimates Siemens PLM's worldwide PLM 
revenues for 2010 in $1,02 billion (6,8% market share) [IDC2010-17]. 
Siemens PLM Software's products include: 
 NX, a CAx (CAD/CAM/CAE) commercial software suite; 
 Teamcenter, an integrated set of PLM and collaboration (cPD) tools; 
 Tecnomatix, a manufacturing and factory planning suite; 
 Velocity Series, an application bundle focused at the mid-market that includes 
CAx application Solid Edge. 
6.4.2.1  Embedded systems engineering st rategy  
Siemens PLM's main focus is on increasing the depth and breadth of its existing 
offering, with a strong emphasis on the openness and stability of its product lines. A 
strong backing from Siemens' core industry practices enables SPLM to both be a lab 
for innovation and have a potential internal customer. 
The vision of Siemens is managing the entire process of integrating software, 
mechanical, electronic and electrical components, in order to allow product makers to 
leverage software configuration management (SCM) or application lifecycle 
management (ALM) systems in conjunction with product lifecycle management (PLM) 
solutions. In a best practice scenario, PLM is used for requirements management, 
system design and hardware development while SCM/ALM is primarily used during 
the software development phase. 
The role of PLM solutions like Siemens PLM Software‘s Teamcenter is providing the 
PLM backbone and mechatronics data model that addresses the needs of both the 
software and the mechanicals components lifecycles. 
Main functions of Siemens' Teamcenter in the domain of Embedded systems are: 
Requirements management, Systems engineering and Unified Modeling Language 
(UML) modeling, Software configuration management, Configuration and calibration 
parameter management, Software dependency and compatibility management, 
Software design component management, Product configuration and variant 
management, Change management, Product and process management, Multi-site 
design collaboration. 
In addition to Siemens CAx product, NX provides an Electromechanical Systems 
Design and Electromechanical simulation modules to integrate mechanical, electronic 
and electrical components and allows for information sharing between electrical, 
mechanical, and control systems designers. In particular, NX automatically creates 
3D models of printed circuit boards – including flexible PCBs -- from ECAD systems 
data for use in mechanical packaging design. Assembly design tools enable virtual 
prototyping with electronic, mechanical, and electrical components in their full product 
context, with associative control structures that simplify product variants and new 
configurations.

6.4.3 Embedded Semiconductor Suppliers 
The embedded semiconductor supplier landscape supports a diverse set of 
companies, and markets. 
Even though there are suppliers that have large revenue pools coming from the 
traditional embedded market, such as Renesas, Freescale, Infineon, Microchip 
Technologies, Texas Instruments (TI), there is not a dominant supplier like there is 
today in mainstream categories such as PCs or mobile phones. The key reason for 
the balance among suppliers is because microcontroller (MCU) and digital signal 
processor (DSP) companies differentiate with proprietary architectures and 
peripherals and support legacy developer investments in programming code 
[IDC2011-27]. 
Traditionally, the microcontroller market has been driven primarily by 4- and 8-bit 
demand from white goods, consumer electronics, and industrial and automotive 
applications. Many of the market segments are deeply embedded with long product 
cycles on one end of the spectrum and short product life cycles and very low-cost 
requirements on the other end. The automotive market has become the largest driver 
of revenue for MCUs, with more than one-third of overall revenue coming from this 
market. 
The study "ICT Man - Exploring the Potential of ICT Components and Systems 
Manufacturing in Europe" [ICTMAN2011], funded by the European Commission and 
produced by VDI/VDE Innovation + Technik GmbH, and CEA Leti, investigates the 
potential of ICT components and systems manufacturing in Europe. The authors of 
the study describe a contrasted situation of electronic components and systems 
manufacturing in Europe considering that Europe suffers from a lack of investment in 
advanced CMOS technologies and large scale manufacturing facilities but retains a 
strong leadership in high growth markets such as automotive, healthcare and to a 
lesser extent in mobile communications. Maintaining excellence and manufacturing 
capabilities is seen as critical by all interviewed stakeholders of the study and the 
study led to the following recommendations [ICTMAN2011]:  
 Actions should be undertaken to favor the development of market opportunities 
for all actors along the value added chain.  
 Incentives should support the full innovation chain from R&D and pilot lines to the 
emergence of global manufacturing leaders while involving all actors from 
material and equipment providers to components and systems manufacturers. 
 It is of the essence that Europe gains in competitiveness by improving its 
attractiveness to investments for manufacturing facilities and communicating 
consistently on the benefit of Entrepreneurship and the value of manufacturing in 
Europe.  
6.4.3.1  ARM Ecosystem  
ARM's architecture is dominant in large volume in cell phones market – 90% on smart 
and mobile phones, 70% on portable media players – where ARM's architecture is 
dominant and accounts for 62% of all ARM-based shipments [IDC2011-27]. 
The ARM architecture only accounts for a small part of the overall MCU market 
(10%). 32-bit MPUs will gradually displace MCUs, MCU replacement is one of ARM's 
fastest-growing licensing and volume shipment opportunities [ARM2011]. New 
64 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
generation of Embedded systems will accelerate this migration as MCUs give way to 
32-bit microprocessor architectures because there is more demand for 32-bit support, 
standard tools and peripherals, larger memory requirements, and scalable 
performance.

7.2.1 Overview 
As stated in BMBF (Ministry of Research and Education) ―ICT Strategy of the German 
Federal Government: Digital Germany 2015”, ―the strengths of the German ICT 
industry lie in software and embedded systems, which are, however, frequently 
unknown to the public‖. BMBF where federal funding comes from in Germany has 
long supported embedded systems research. However, the focus on embedded 
systems identified as a strategic research area as such has emerged with the 
German High-Tech Strategy that was launched in August 2006. So far, embedded 
systems had long been a very significant part of research carried out in application-
oriented or industry-specific areas such as Automotive, Aerospace, Energy or Health.  
7.2.1.1  The German High-Tech Strategy  
The German High-Tech Strategy aims at making Germany a leading provider of High-
Tech solutions in five areas: climate/energy, health/nutrition, mobility, security, and 
communication (Information and Communication Technologies). The focus has been 
put on forward-looking projects that should pursue specific objectives related to 
scientific and technological development over a period of ten to fifteen years. Here 
are following central examples of forward-looking projects formulated by the High-
Tech Strategy that require embedded systems research: 
 CO2-neutral, energy-efficient and climate-adapted cities; 
 The intelligent restructuring of the energy supply system; 
 Treating illnesses more effectively with the help of individualized medicine; 
 Living an independent life well into old age; 
 A million electric vehicles in Germany by 2020; 
 Making global knowledge digitally available and accessible. 
Funding programs under the High-Tech Strategy such as ―E-Energy – smart Grid 
made in Germany‖ and ―Connected Living‖ (see Table 20) are good examples of 
industry-specific and application-oriented programs that require embedded systems 
research without being embedded-systems centric  
The German High-Tech Strategy also brought a new focus on the development of 
embedded systems across multiple domains via methods and process-oriented 
Horizontal projects. In the ‖Hightech-Strategie 2020 für Deutschland‖ published in 
2010, ICT in complex systems" (e.g. embedded systems) have become one of the 
three most strategic research and development areas together with "new business 
processes and production methods" and "the internet of things and services". Efforts 
have been concentrated on the quality-based goals of efficiency, security, user 
friendliness and resource efficiency. The German High-Tech Strategy has thus 
generated two embedded system-centric large-scale research projects (SPES 2020 
and VIERforES, see Table 20) in this field. 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 75 
7.2.1.2  Towards a National  Strategic Agenda for  Embedded 
Systems 
These changes have resulted from joint efforts from both research and Industry, with 
the ICT industry and the automotive industry playing a major role. The creation by 
BITKOM (the Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications 
and New Media) of a working group on Embedded Systems (see Table 21) strongly 
contributed to the visibility of Embedded Systems in the recent years thanks to the 
organization of a yearly Embedded Systems Symposium and joint events with its 
French counterpart Syntec Numérique as well as the publication of studies and 
position papers. VDE, the Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information 
Technologies (see Table 21) also published a position paper on Embedded Systems 
(February 2010). 
In 2009, a group of more than 40 decision makers from important companies, 
research institutes and relevant industry associations (ZVEI, the German electrical 
and electronics industry association, VDE and BITKOM, see Table 20) came together 
to give birth to the National Roadmap Embedded Systems (NRMES, see section 
National Roadmap Embedded Systems, Table 22) for the further development of 
embedded systems technology.  
Supported by the Federal Ministry for Research and Education (BMBF), The NRMES 
project was managed by ZVEI and SafeTRANS Cluster (see Table 20 and Figure 5). 
The NRMES describes the research needed in the area of embedded systems during 
the next 15 years (see section ―National Roadmap Embedded Systems and Table 21) 
Focus is put on a required horizontal approach to improve Embedded Systems 
design and engineering methods.  
BMBF included NRMES in its ―Hightech-Strategie 2020 für Deutschland‖ as an 
important action line and BMBF also decided to support the ACATECH ―Research 
Agenda Cyber-Physical Systems‖ led by SafeTRANS cluster and Oldenburg-based 
OFFIS in that was launched in 2010 and that aims at creating a cross-industry 
agenda building on the NRMES and prioritizing research objectives to align future 
R&D projects. ACATECH is the German Academy of Science and Engineering. The 
main deliverable of this project is a position paper that was published in December 
2011 (see section Acatech Agenda CPS). BMBF made it clear that it would use these 
recommendations to propose an approach implementing the Roadmap while using 
the existing funding instruments at the national and European level. At the EU level, 
BNMF has for example contributed to the ARTEMIS Joint Undertaking CESAR 
project funding (see Table 20). 
Once can reasonably say today that Embedded Systems have become a ―key 
technology (Schlüsseltechnologie) transcending the ―big five‖ areas for Research 
(Health, Energy, Communication (ICT), Mobility, Security) and crucial for the 
competitiveness of the German economy. 
7.2.1.3  The role  of  sc ience and industry  cooperat ion in  the regions  
Regional Government funding is also very important in Germany. One should bear in 
mind that approximately one third of government investment in Germany comes from 
the Länder. Many research labs and universities are owned or partially funded by the 
Länder and invest public money in research projects that they do at least partly on 
their own budget. 
76 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
The German innovation landscape is also characterized by closer and closer 
cooperation between the worlds of science and industry trough public private projects. 
The 60 Fraunhofer Institutes of the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft are the best example of 
applied research in Germany in terms of scale. Two thirds of their research revenues 
are derived from contracts with industry and from publicly financed research projects. 
Only one third comes from the German federal and Länder governments in the form 
of institutional fund. A Fraunhofer Alliance for Embedded Systems was launched in 
2010 (see Table 21) to combine the expertise of all member institutions in order to 
enable cross-cutting contract research projects with industry partners. Geographical 
"clusters." are the other concrete examples of this science and industry cooperation in 
the regions. Clusters are industry or technology-specific networks or competence 
centers which cover the complete R&D and production chain at one site. In the 
embedded systems area, SafeTRANS ("Safety in Transportation Systems", see 
Table 20), is a major competence cluster combining research and development 
expertise in the area of complex embedded systems in transportation systems (see 
also BICC-Net and the Strategic Partnership for Sensor Technologies in Table 20). 
Although the new European cluster policy is still in its infancy, we can see projects 
involving competitiveness clusters at regional level that have started to work across 
borders like the cooperation of SafeTRANS with French clusters System@tic and 
Aerospace Valley within the framework of the EICOSE initiative and ITEA2 applied 
research projects involve partners from different European countries that are funded 
directly by the governments of their respective countries. Examples of Eureka ITEA 2 
projects (MODELISAR, OSAMI) funded by BMBF can be found in Table 20.  
It is interesting to mention that no embedded-systems centric clusters as SafeTRANS 
joined the leading-edge cluster funding competition. The latter is a flagship initiative 
within the German High-Tech Strategy, under which up to EUR 200 million will be 
made available to up to five leading edge clusters over a period of no longer than five 
years in three separate rounds of competition.

7.2.2 The National Roadmap Embedded Systems 
The National Roadmap Embedded Systems was published on 8th December 2009 r 
in occasion of the 4th IT-Summit of the German Federal Government by the German 
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' association (ZVEI). This document was the 
result of a large joint research and industry effort supported by the German 
government. It described the future strategic fields of applications for Embedded 
Systems. Six main research areas (see Table 22) were identified. 
82 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
The ultimate goals of the roadmap are:  
 To protect more than 3 million high tech jobs in Germany; 
 To retain leadership in innovation of major industries with a turnover of more than 
750 bn €; 
 To stimulate the required cross-industry cooperation. 
The Research effort needed to reach these goals was estimated to be at least 2,5 bn 
€. ―Autonomous Systems‖, ―Architecture principles‖, ―Virtual Engineering‖, ―Distributed 
Real time situation awareness and solution finding‖ areas would require 500 Million € 
whereas ―Seamless Interaction‖ and ―Safety and Security‖ areas would concentrate 
200 Million € each. This means that a substantial increase of public funding is 
compulsory. 
Other main recommendations are:  
 New projects should be focused on cross domain applicability of results; 
 Reference technology platforms should be established to ensure sustainability of 
R&D results; 
 Open industry standards for interoperability should be created. Appropriate 
European regulatory frameworks should be established in coordination with 
national rules; 
  A suggested flagship project ―Smart mobility‖ would address the societal 
challenge of Mobility (green mobility, safe mobility, and support for elderly 
drivers). It would relate to the research areas Architecture Principles, and Safe 
and Secure Systems, creating architectures, methods, and processes enabling 
real time traffic situation awareness for safe, efficient, green and comfortable 
mobility; 
 The German Innovation Alliance SPES 2020 would drive the implementation of 
downstream research projects at the national level. This consortium unites

7.2.3 Acatech Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) Agenda 
The German Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech) was established in 
2008. It is a non-profit agency. Its funding derives from the federal government and 
states. Additional funding comes from donations and project-related third-party 
sources. Acatech is a working academy with roughly 330 members from science and 
industry.  
In 2010, Acatech joined forces with academics, associations and entrepreneurs to 
launch the project ―Integrated research agenda Cyber-Physical Systems.. In the 
USA, a National Agenda Cyber-Physical Systems had been launched by the NSF in 
2006. The Agenda CPS project therefore hopes to introduce an initial definition of 
CPS within Europe, as a core contribution to the international CPS research debate 
and as a basis for further research work. Cyber-physical systems typically comprise 
embedded systems (as parts of devices, buildings, vehicles, routes, production 
plants, logistics and management processes etc.) that: 
 use sensors and actuators to gather physical data directly and to directly affect 
physical processes; 
 are connected to digital networks (wireless, wired, local, global); 
 use globally available data and services; 
 Possess a range of multi-modal human-machine interfaces (dedicated interfaces 
in devices, or unspecific interfaces accessed through browsers, etc.). 
The project has the following objectives: 
 Determine the enormous social and economic importance of cyber-physical 
systems; 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 85 
 Determine the state of knowledge and technology by international standards and 
establish a benchmark to reflect Germany‗s position; 
 Determine the measures to exploit the potential of CPS and disseminate 
proposals for leading projects; 
 Prioritize research objectives and develop an integrated research agenda for 
cyber-physical systems. 
CPS covers the following areas of technology:  
 Embedded software-intensive systems (ESIS); 
  Networked software-intensive systems, or Systems of Systems (SoSs); 
 Integration of ESIS/SoSs to form comprehensive, non-domain-specific 
application systems (for example: fleet management and remote 
diagnosis/maintenance, Ambient Assisted Living); 
 Open, flexibly networked cyber-physical systems and application environments: 
Integrated CPS are created from the alternating, application-driven integration of 
classic technical systems (ESIS/SoSs), operational information systems and 
web-based systems and services; 
 Interactions and flexible integration of CPS: The reciprocal use of data and 
services by CPS (for example: the interaction between smart grid systems and 
building management or traffic management in electromobility systems). 
Main challenges to be tacked are: 
 Technological and scientific challenges 
CPS create core technological challenges for traditional system architectures, 
especially because of their high degree of connectivity. CPS are not constructed for 
one specific purpose or function. They are open for many different services and 
processes, and must therefore be adaptable. In view of their evolutionary nature, 
they are only controllable to a limited extent. This creates new demands for greater 
interoperability and communication within CPS that cannot be met by current closed 
systems. CPS research is much needed to overcome the issues relating to usability, 
safety, security and acceptance, as well as the adaptability and integrability of the 
systems.  
 Economic challenges 
Due to their interconnection and the resulting complexity, , services within a large-
scale CPS can no longer be developed and operated by a single provider, but can 
only function in an integrative manner within the system infrastructure, adapted to 
existing technologies, services and solutions. 
 Social and political challenges 
The effects of CPS as drivers of enormous technological and economic changes have 
significant impact on users, not only as consumers. However, the success of a 
technological innovation primarily depends on consumers acceptance.– Therefore, 
86 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
the successful exploitation of the potential of a CPS is also strongly linked to its ease 
of use and its functional benefits. CPS are also complex socio-technical systems that 
change the way we perceive and experience reality, and the way people and 
organizations undertake certain activities. This means a concerted dialogue is needed 
between the different groups in society, not least in order to agree on envisaged 
objectives and secure acceptance. 
CPS Agenda position paper main recommendations are:  
 An integrated cooperative approach is a prerequisite to create the needed 
favorable context for Cyber-Physical Systems to arise and prosper; 
 Interoperability standards should be elaborated and standardization activities in 
international committees should be supported; 
 Research, education and implementation in the Man - Machine interaction area 
need to be enhanced. Human factors such as ergonomy should be paid much 
attention at; 
 As Germany is still weak in the area of Internet technologies and their related 
social issues have little been discussed so far, the academy recommends the 
establishment of a national research and competence center for the Internet of 
things and data services.; 
 Security of Cyber-Physical Systems and data protection in particular require to 
set up a working group of scientists, lawyers and politicians that will work on 
―personal data in CPS‖; 
 A dialogue should be initiated on the use of societal innovations enabled by 
Cyber-Physical systems. The population should be made aware of the 
development of Cyber-Physical Systems and given explanations on security 
issues. Showcase pilots and living labs would help make the applications visible 
to the public; 
 Specific platforms should be established to test and refine new business models 
for Cyber-Physical systems. A research effort should accompany this; 
 Platforms and collaborative projects for the promotion of Cyber-Physical Systems 
should be created and recruit SMEs. Access to research projects should be 
simplified for SMEs. Spin-offs, especially from universities, should be 
encouraged; 
 A national research and competence center for the Internet of things and the 
Internet of services should be set up to deal with all the topics discussed in the 
context of global networks; 
 Existing academic and training courses (Computer science, Engineering, 
Business Administration) should be adapted to the new challenges of complex 
cyber-physical system. The Academy recommends creating interdisciplinary 
programs at the cross-sectional technology as well as cross-disciplinary 
innovation alliances in industry and research. A. new interdisciplinary degree to 
Cyber-Physical Systems should be created; 
 German scientists should dedicate time and resources to interdisciplinary 
Projects on Cyber-Physical Systems. There is a need for integrated and 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 87 
interdisciplinary research topics on Cyber-Physical Systems. This work should be 
done within the framework of ―innovation alliances‖ between industry and 
research. 
7.2.4 SafeTRANS 
SafeTRANS ("Safety in Transportation Systems") is a Competence Cluster combining 
research and development expertise in the area of complex embedded systems in 
transportation systems.

following challenges in its research area System and Embedded Software 
Development Process: 
 Models: to develop mathematical models of design entities covering the entire 
design space for complex safety-critical embedded systems; 
 Analysis: to develop scalable, mathematically rigorous analysis methods for 
cross-domain, cross-layer, and cross-viewpoint analysis for complex safety-
critical embedded systems; 
 Design: to develop a design theory for complex safety-critical embedded systems 
allowing their modular construction with guaranteed compliance to system-level 
requirements; 
 Testing: to develop a comprehensive testing theory and technology for complex 
embedded systems.

i n i t i a t i v e s  i n  t h e  U K  
7.3.1 Ministry of Defense (MoD) Systems of Systems 
Developed MODAF (modeling language for Systems of Systems like the DoD‘s 
DODAF) is used on many military programs, e.g. used for Afghanistan operations. 
The British Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) is also used by 
BAE Systems, Thales, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Serco in UK as well as 
government agencies such as GCHQ (the central ―listening‖ centre) and National Air 
Traffic Services (NATS). It is also used by Swedish Armed Forces and has been 
adapted by NATO to form the core of the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF). 
7.3.2 Department of Transport 
The Department for Transport (DfT) commissioned a report named "Systems of 
Systems Think Piece". This was a report on Systems of Systems prepared for the 
Chief Scientific Advisor in the UK by a number of interested industries to define a 
―systems of systems‖ approach for the UK‘s transport infrastructure. The report was 
published in December 2008. 
This report recommended the following actions: 
 Develop an awareness and educational campaign of ‗System of Systems‘ 
thinking for transport practitioners. Show by example with case studies. Such a 
campaign should have an external interface to transport industries and service 
providers; 
 Build from the focus and community attracted around the Foresight Intelligent 
Infrastructures work to bring together a broader community who could impact on 
our future national transport system. For instance, in Government, this 
community would include DfT, DfES, DCLG, DoH, BERR, DIUS, TSB, etc. 
Additionally, membership from outside of Government is equally important, from 
industry, trade associations, think tanks/policy bodies, transport partnerships, 
groups of users etc. ‗Softer‘ System of Systems methodologies, such as Soft 
Systems Thinking (SST), could play an important part in catalyzing the thinking 
and helping draw together a broad community into a common purpose; 
 Targeting the implementation of Eddington‘s recommendations and the 
Department‘s response to them; it is recommended that the Department 
commissions the development of a ―system-level model‖ of the national transport 
system, which at a high-level brings together the policy factors of environment, 
safety/social inclusion, through-put/economy, etc. It is recommended that a 
Systems Dynamics (SD) approach is taken; this would model the high level 
interaction of policy across environment, transport, energy and economic growth. 
We would recommend starting with a simple influence diagram and build 
incrementally, probably via a series of facilitated sessions at Board level. The 
model would parameterize and add detailed simulation where knowledge exists; 
 Examine the feasibility of a transport-wide SoS approach utilizing Enterprise 
Architecture (EA) methods. Appoint DfT EA Advisory Team, including 
representatives from leading EA consultancies. Learn lessons from the MoD 
experience in EA and architecture frameworks and existing work within the 
90 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
Department on the development of enterprise architectures for road pricing and 
ITS; 
 Develop a modeling framework for transport modeling to underpin this process. 
Specifically to focus attention on accelerating the existing work on the 
development of an ITS architecture; 
 Build on successful aspects of existing examples in transport such as Transport 
Direct and Road Pricing Consistency Framework. Review the current approach in 
the light of SoS methods and examine feasibility of integrating these approaches 
now. 
7.3.3 INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) 
This is an attempt by industry (BAE Systems, EADS Astrium, General Dynamics 
United Kingdom Limited, Thales, Ultra Electronics) academics (Loughborough 
University, University College London) and the MoD to define a means of assessing 
competences in systems engineering so the necessary skills are available in 
engineering teams. 
7.3.4 Technology Strategy Board (UK Industry Funding) 
The Strategy and Implementation Plan for Technology and Innovation Centers 
published by the Technology Strategy Board on May, 26 2011 identified a candidate 
list of 10 areas for possible investment in the next phase of its program and said that 
TSB would be engaging with the relevant business and academic communities to 
assess what contribution a Technology and Innovation Centre (TIC) could make and 
what their focus might be. Complex Systems is one of the potential candidate areas. 
Basically this is a group set up to identify where the government should put funding. 
Actual amounts of funding have not been identified as yet. 
7.3.5 EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) 
EPRC is the main body for funding University research in UK. The Key initiative in 
Large Scale Complex IT Systems is LSCITS that has a number of University 
contributors, Leeds, Oxford, York, St Andrews, Bristol and Aston. This has over 10 
million pounds of funding from 2007 to 2012. It is a research and graduate education 
program. This came from a report from the Royal Academy of Engineering and the 
British Computer Society looking at the causes of failure of a number of large 
software projects from which a number of recommendations were made for research. 
The Department of Trade and Industry also published a report on Complexity and 
Emergent Behavior in ICT Systems highlighting the need for interdisciplinary research 
and a different approach to undergraduate teaching in computer science. In addition 
to research the program funds an Engineering Doctorate Program. 
7.3.6 SICSA Complex Systems Engineering in Scotland 
This is a Complex Systems Engineering program local to Scotland. 
The fundamental economic, governmental and social infrastructure in our society 
depends on large and complex systems. As our hardware and networking capabilities 
increase, this leads to an increasing demand for greater software capability and 
integration. It is no longer appropriate to think of these large systems as single 
entities but as systems of systems whose components are independent entities. 
However, the development of such large-scale systems of systems is problematic as 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 91 
evidenced by reports of software cost over-runs and failures of systems to satisfy the 
requirements of those who procure and use them. 
The Scottish computer science research community has a range of expertise that can 
be deployed to address the problems of complex systems engineering. These require 
theoretical and practical research that can develop new conceptual models and 
significant practical advances in software systems engineering. The research 
challenges in complex systems engineering span a range of areas from fundamental 
mathematics to education to organizational change. The intention is to focus 
investment by building on existing Scottish work in two areas, namely socio-technical 
systems (STS) engineering and autonomic systems. 
Progress in the first area requires combining both social and technical perspectives 
and, Scotland is uniquely equipped to do so. Scotland is active in the area of socio-
technical systems engineering, with current collaborations between, for instance, St 
Andrews and Edinburgh, considering issues of responsibility and trust. Turning to 
autonomics, St Andrews is active in autonomic systems engineering and Heriot-Watt 
in distributed systems, and there is considerable potential for further fruitful 
collaborations across Scotland in distributed systems and novel systems 
architectures.

Description 
The emerging System-of-Systems (SoS) concept describes the large scale integration of many independent self-contained 
systems to satisfy global needs or multiple requests. The increasing number of interacting (mostly embedded) systems in 
our strongly connected society and industry as well as the growing overall complexity of systems have triggered a paradigm 
shift and the need to enhance the classical view of Complex System Engineering towards SoS Engineering. SoS find their 
application in many highly relevant areas to our society: air-traffic control, urban transport, smart grids and integrated multi-
site production, among others. 
The inherent complexity of SoS as well as the need to meet optimised performance for both the individual systems and 
SoS, raise many questions which are the object of important research efforts nowadays. 
The project Road2SoS will develop advanced research and engineering roadmaps to identify future RTD and Innovation 
(RTD&I) strategies for Europe in the field of SoS Engineering in four key domains: 
 Distributed energy generation and smart grids; 
 Integrated multi-site industrial production; 
 Multi-modal traffic control; 
 Emergency & crisis management. 
Impact 
The roadmaps will comprise the latest high-level scientific results and will identify trends in research and development and 
associate them to future product and application visions.  
They will also be integrated in the socio-economic context, via workshops and case studies in order to facilitate the transfer 
and integration of European RTD+I results and developments from the SoS Engineering sector to relevant stakeholders.  
The project will help European organisations to stay at the front of these new developments and to be prepared for future 
challenges in the industrial applications of SoS in order to reinforce the leading position of the European industry in 
Complex System Engineering.

Description: 
The 24-month T-AREA-SoS Support Action addresses ICT-2011.3.3, target outcome g) to analyse international research 
agendas to prepare concrete joint R&D initiatives for international collaboration, particularly with the USA in the area of 
System of systems (SoS) . The concept for this proposal is to exploit the established networks of the participants and 
associates (based in EU and US) including the extant activities they lead within the IEEE and INCOSE in the area of SoS to 
explore and evolve SoS R& D themes and priorites for FP7/FP8 and other international programmes that will lead to 
outcomes that address societal needs, with exemplars across a wide variety of sectors including non-traditional aspects of 
Energy, Transport, and Production, using Engineering of SoS (i.e. SoSE) as a mainstream discipline for the management of 
large complex systems. 
It is a basic premise of this proposal that SoS engineering includes, as a central component, the consideration of societal 
needs and issues within the management of large, socially-significant system of systems. It is also understood that SoSE is 
an emerging discipline that deals with ultra large systems that include many heterogeneous systems that may be 
independently owned and/or operated, distributed, evolutionary in nature and which exhibit emergent behaviours. 
Impact: 
The outputs from this Support Action will be a strategic research agenda that will create the environment for the 
development of concrete research initiatives through which the EU and the US which will collaborate to enhance existing 
research programmes and set the scene for future programmes. These outputs will be supported by an analysis of the state 
of the art and high level definition of research requirements in SoSE, and a thesaurus to enable concepts to be shared 
across industrial sectors and technical disciplines. 
Through the creation of a SoSE research agenda commonly agreed by EU and US stakeholders with initiatives to be 
embedded in future FP7/FP8 programmes the aim of this proposal to increase European competitiveness in, and improve 
the societal impact of, the development and management of large complex systems in a range of sectors.

Description: 
Systems of Systems consist of collections of (possibly independent, pre-existing, geographically distributed and following 
their own goals) constituent systems whose behaviours are coordinated to provide services and additional value with 
respect to their original intended operations. This kind of entities offer severe technical, management, and political 
challenges as witnessed by energy blackouts such as the one experienced by Italy in 2003 and the emergency 
management disaster in response to the hurricane Katrina in 2005.  
DANSE aims at developing new approaches to the design and management of the operation of SoS based on: 
 Advanced methodologies based on a new evolutionary, 
 Adaptive and iterative SoS life-cycle model; 
 Semantically sound models based on the notion of contracts; 
 Innovative architectures that provide the infrastructure to allow the dynamic affiliation of components so that the 
behaviour of the ensemble is not disturbed; 
 Novel supporting tools for analysis, simulation, and optimization; 
 Organized in an integrated environment.  
Impact: 
DANSE will develop training material and classes that help advance the knowledge base of European industry and 
government to allow the creation of new services and to substantially improve existing ones to levels of efficiency that are 
unthinkable today.  
DANSE includes industrial representatives with focus on Aerospace and Land systems and Automotive, leading tools and 
framework provider in the system space and top European research institutes in system engineering. The partners have a 
deep interest in the outcome of the research and are eager to deploy them as soon as they become available.  
Three Test Cases Air Traffic Management, Autonomous Ground Transport and Integrated Water Treatment and Supply 
which are real industrial problems planned for commercial development, have been identified to validate DANSE approach. 
The last case is a full-fledged industrial project used for the demonstration of the DANSE paradigm.

Description 
The design of innovative products and services that take advantage of Systems of Systems (SoS) technology is in its 
infancy. It is hampered by the complexity caused by the heterogeneity and independence of SoS constituent systems and 
the difficulty of communication between diverse stakeholders.  
The state of the art in SoS engineering lacks models and tools that help developers to make trade-off decisions during 
design and evolution, and assist in working out and recording precise contracts between constituents and the global SoS. 
This leads to sub-optimal design and expensive rework during integration and in service. 
COMPASS will augment existing industry tools and practice with an underlying modelling language in which SoS 
architectures and contracts can be expressed. A formal semantic foundation the first to be developed specifically for SoS 
engineering will enable this language to support analysis of global SoS properties. The language and methods will be 
supported by an open, extendible tools platform with integrated prototype plug-ins for model construction, dynamic analysis 
by simulation and test automation, static analysis by model-checking and proof, and links to an established architectural 
modelling language (SysML). These strengthened foundations and tools will support enhanced methods guidelines that 
help users embed this new technology in industrial SoS practice. 
Impact 
Technical advances in COMPASS are focussed on industry needs evaluated through substantial industry-led case studies 
in three diverse and complementary areas. These will be augmented by challenge problems solicited from a range of SoS 
stakeholders and developer organisations through a special interest group.  
The open platform, tools plug-ins, semantics, development guidelines, industry case study experience and challenge 
problems will ensure that COMPASSs outputs can be readily exploited by SoS developers and stakeholders as well as in 
future research and development.

7 . 5  A n n e x e s  E  –  J T I  A r t e m i s  
ARTEMIS (Advanced Research & Technology in EMbedded Intelligence and 
Systems) is a 2006 public-private partnership that aims at supporting the co-
financing of research initiatives at European level and improving cooperation between 
the various operators in the embedded systems sector. ARTEMIS contributes to the 
implementation of the Specific Program "Cooperation" of the Seventh Framework 
Research and Development Program (7th FRDP). In addition, since 2008 a JU (Joint 
Undertaking) was established to further implement the ARTEMIS objectives. 
7.5.1 The First Strategic research Agenda (SRA) 2006 
One of ARTEMIS' objectives was to define a common strategic research agenda to 
become a reference in its own domain and attract commitment of all stakeholders in 
the sector. ARTEMIS wants to create the necessary critical mass and co-ordinate 
research efforts and initiatives across Europe in order to establish and implement a 
coherent and integrated European research and development strategy for Embedded 
Systems. 
The research required to achieve these objectives falls into three main areas: 
 Reference designs and architectures. The objective is the creation of a 
generic platform and a suite of abstract components with which new 
developments in different application domains can be engineered with minimal 
effort. A well-conceived platform will also allow the addition of application-specific 
modules, thereby increasing the reach of the reference design into more 
advanced and diverse application domains. They will challenge the functional 
and physical complexity issues and embrace all areas of the target application, 
also addressing functional and non-functional items; 
 Seamless connectivity and middleware. This seamless connectivity is a vital 
element in the model of future Embedded Systems. It includes the middleware, 
operating systems, and other functions required to link the physical world, as 
seen by the networked nodes, to the higher layer applications. 
 Design methods and tools. These are essential for rapid design and 
prototyping, without which it is unrealistic to attempt development of such 
complex systems. The objectives are: design efficiency, systematic design, 
productivity and quality. For example, radical design and verification 
methodologies, including specific approaches for systems modeling and 
simulation, enabling both software and hardware instantiation from high-level 
descriptions with automatic co-verification, are required in order to achieve an 
order of magnitude advance in productivity. 
While ARTEMIS seeks maximum commonality across application sectors, it is 
recognised that different application domains impose differing demands on the 
technology to be developed. These Application Contexts are: 
 “Industrial systems” - large, complex and safety critical systems, that 
embraces Automotive,Aerospace, Manufacturing, and specific growth areas such 
as biomedical; 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 97 
 “Nomadic Environments” – enabling devices such as PDAs and on-body 
systems to communicate in changing and mobile environments, that offer users 
access to information and services while on the move; 
 “Private Spaces”, - such as houses, cars and offices, that offers systems and 
solutions for improved enjoyment, comfort, well-being and safety; 
 ―Public Infrastructure” – major infrastructure such as airports, cities and 
highways that embrace large scale deployment of systems and services that 
benefit the citizen at large (communications networks, improved mobility, energy 
distribution, intelligent buildings...). 
ARTEMIS has defined 12 common objectives across technology and domains: 
Sustainability, Design Efficiency, Ease of use, High added value, Time to market, 
Modularity, Safety/Security, Robustness, Competitiveness, Innovation, Cost 
reduction, and Interoperability. 
The ARTEMIS strategy therefore takes a two-dimensional matrix approach: on one 
side the four clustersof Application Contexts, and on the other the three Research 
Domains. 
Figure 6 summarizes the cross relations bewteen research and application contexts.

7.5.2 The 2011 Strategic research Agenda (SRA) 
In 2011, a new SRA has been issued. Embedded Systems has become the ‗Neural 
System‘ of society: they are now everywhere pervading all market sectors, and 
greater public awareness is raising expectations and concerns. Interoperating 
applications from multiple domains over open networks increase systems complexity. 
Embedded systems technology are contributing to tackle societal challenges such as 
98 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
 Health & Well being; 
 Green safe & Supportive transportation; 
 Smart buildings and communities of the future. 
Therefore the SRA 2011 augments the 2006 framework with more horizontalisation to 
overcome the fragmentation, while mastering the complexity, for yielding multi-
domain reusable results. The result is a new three dimensions approach to achieve 
multi-domain compatibility, for cross-domain approach to support a variety of 
applications, services as solutions for societal challenges. 
The ARTEMIS SRA 2011 modifies some of the existing challenges and introduces 
additional grand research challenges – referred to as ‗major challenges‘- so as to take 
account of the societal challenges and the ever-increasing importance of networked 
intelligence in the short, medium and longer terms. Major topics include: 
 Open Internet; 
 Robustness, autonomy and mixed critical systems; 
 Real life experiments in Living labs; 
 Embedded System Design and Architecture; 
 Systems of systems; 
 Semantic interoperability; 
 Certification for mixed criticality & modular certification; 
 Safety, security, 
 Energy consumption. 
7.5.3 First interim evaluation 
The first interim evaluation of the ARTEMIS JTI is a positive report on the 
implementation of the JTI but notes that its key strategic objectives did not achieved 
the expected level. Furthermore the level of overall budget commitment is significantly 
below that fixed [ARTEVAL2010].

7.7.1 Networking and Information Technology Research and 
Development (NITR) program 
The NITRD Program provides a framework in which many Federal agencies come 
together to coordinate their networking and information technology (IT) research and 
development (R&D) efforts. 
The Program operates under the aegis of the NITRD Subcommittee of the National 
Science and Technology Council's (NSTC) Committee on Technology. The 
Subcommittee, made up of representatives from each of NITRD's member agencies, 
provides overall coordination for NITRD activities. 
Federal IT R&D, which launched and fueled the digital revolution, continues to drive 
innovation in scientific research, national security, communication, and commerce to 
sustain U.S. technological leadership. The NITRD agencies' collaborative efforts 
increase the overall effectiveness and productivity of these Federal R&D investments, 
leveraging strengths, avoiding duplication, and increasing interoperability of R&D 
products. 
7.7.1.1  High Conf idence Software and Systems (HCSS)  
HCSS R&D supports development of scientific foundations and innovative and 
enabling software and hardware technologies for the engineering, verification and 
validation, assurance, and certification of complex, networked, distributed computing 
systems and cyber-physical (IT-enabled) systems (CPS).  
The goal is to enable seamless, fully synergistic integration of computational 
intelligence, communication, control, sensing, actuation, and adaptation with physical 
devices and information processes to routinely realize high-confidence, optimally 
performing systems that are essential for effectively operating life-, safety-, security-, 
and mission-critical applications.  
These systems must be capable of interacting correctly, safely, and securely with 
humans and the physical world in changing environments and unforeseen conditions. 
In many cases, they must be certifiably dependable. The vision is to realize 
dependable systems that are more precise and highly efficient; respond more quickly; 
work in dangerous or inaccessible environments; provide large-scale, distributed 
coordination; augment human capabilities; and enhance societal quality of life. New 
science and technology are needed to build these systems with computing, 
communication, information, and control pervasively embedded at all levels, thus 
enabling entirely new generations of engineering designs that can enhance U.S, 
competitiveness across economic and industrial sectors. 
For the program High Confidence Software and Systems (HCSS), the budget request 
is $ 163 million in 2011 with a budget of $ 127,5 million. 
7.7.1.2  Strategic Prior it ies Underly ing Th is Request

7.7.2 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 
DARPA‘s mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. military and 
prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring 
revolutionary, high-payoff research bridging the gap between fundamental discoveries 
and their military use. To fulfill its mission, the Agency relies on diverse performers to 
apply multi-disciplinary approaches to both advance knowledge through basic 
research and create innovative technologies that address current practical problems 
through applied research. DARPA‘s scientific investigations span the gamut from 
laboratory efforts to the creation of full-scale technology demonstrations in the fields 
of biology, medicine, computer science, chemistry, physics, engineering, 
mathematics, material sciences, social sciences, neurosciences and more. As the 
DoD‘s primary innovation engine, DARPA undertakes projects that are finite in 
duration but that create lasting revolutionary change. 
The DARPA is organized in six technical offices: 
 Adaptive Execution Office (AEO); 
 Defense Sciences Office (DSO); 
 Information Innovation Office (IIO); 
 Microsystems Technology Office (MTO); 
 Strategic Technology Office (STO); 
 Tactical Technology Office (TTO). 
In 2010, the DARPA announced a funding opportunity of $18,4 million named META-
II. The META-II solicitation follows an earlier META solicitation (DARPA-BAA-10-21) 
with modified technical objectives and a fundamentally different program structure 
designed to enable offerors to submit innovative ideas that address only a portion of 
the overall program scope. 
7.7.2.1  Program scope & structure  
With the META-II program, DARPA is pursuing five technical areas that seek to 
further the vision described in the preceding pages. These technical areas are: 
 Metric of complexity; 
 Metric of adaptability; 
 Metalanguage for system representation; 
 Design flow & tools; 
 Verification flow & tools. 
The program duration will be 12 months from the date of award. Offerors may submit 
proposals to one, several, or all of the technical areas detailed below. Although the 
technical areas are clearly inter-related, offerors are encouraged to submit separate 
proposals for each one or include them as priced options to their core proposal so as 
to enable DARPA to fund a subset of their proposed technical areas. 
106 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
Although the products of META-II should be generally applicable across a variety of 
cyberphysical systems with substantial electromechanical content, the specific 
domains of interest which should be employed by proposers for calibration, validation, 
and sample application of their work are ground combat vehicles, airplanes, or 
rotorcraft. 
7.7.3 National Science Foundation (NSF) http://www.nsf.gov 
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency created by 
Congress in 1950 "to promote the progress of science; to advance the national 
health, prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense…" With an annual 
budget of about $6.9 billion (FY 2010), NSF is the funding source for approximately 
20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by America's colleges 
and universities. In many fields such as mathematics, computer science and the 
social sciences, NSF is the major source of federal backing. 
According to the NFS organization, we found relevant initiatives through multiple NFS 
directorates: 
 The Directorate for Engineering (ENG/OAD) through the NFS promotes the 
progress of engineering in the United States in order to enable the Nation's 
capacity to perform. Its investments in engineering research and education aim 
at building and strengthening a national capacity for innovation that can lead over 
time to the creation of new shared wealth and a better quality of life. Most NSF 
programs in engineering are funded through the Directorate for Engineering, 
which also sponsors the NSF's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) 
program: 
 The Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division is 
one of the four divisions of the Directorate for Engineering at the National 
Science Foundation. Its mission is to fund fundamental research and 
education in support of the Foundation‘s strategic goals directed at 
advances in the disciplines of civil, mechanical, industrial and manufacturing 
engineering, and materials design. In addition, the Division has a focus on 
the reduction of risks and damage resulting from earthquakes and other 
natural and technological hazards. The Division encourages cross-
disciplinary research partnerships at the intersections of traditional 
disciplines to promote transformative advances in civil, mechanical and 
industrial systems and manufacturing technologies. It also encourages 
discovery enabled by the use of cross-cutting technologies such as adaptive 
systems, nanotechnology and simulation. The integration of research and 
education is supported across all programs of the Division. The CMMI 
Division is organized into four program clusters, each containing four to six 
academic research programs: 
 Mechanics and Engineering Materials; 
 Systems Engineering and Design (SED); 
 Resilient and Sustainable Infrastructures; 
 Advanced Manufacturing. 
The Systems Engineering and Design (SED) cluster supports fundamental 
research on the decision-making aspects of engineering, including design, control, 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 107 
and optimization as applied at levels ranging from component to enterprise systems. 
Supported research examples include sensors, sensing and the use of sensor data in 
decision-making and control, and extends to service enterprise systems that address 
healthcare delivery. Support is provided to enable advances in engineering decision-
making, optimization and control, and their application to engineered systems. 
Regarding the SED cluster, we identify three relevant funding programs: 
1. The Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI) funding program that supports 
research leading to design theory and to tools and methods that enable 
implementation of the principles of design theory in the practice of design across 
the full spectrum of engineered products. The program focus is on gaining an 
understanding of the basic processes and phenomena underlying a holistic, life-
cycle view of design where the total system life-cycle context recognizes the 
need of advanced understanding of the identification and definition of 
preferences, analysis of alternatives, effective accommodation of uncertainty in 
decision-making, and the relationship between data and knowledge in a digitally-
supported process. The program funds advance in basic design theory, tools, 
and software to implement design theory and new design methods that span 
multiple domains, such as design for the environment and for manufacturability. 
Example of the recent award made through this program: 
Resource Allocation for Airliner Safety: A Design Perspective on Dealing with the 
Unexpected in Complex Systems. 
Start Date: September 1, 2011. Expires: August 31, 2014 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $400 000. 
The research objective of this award is to model the contributions to airliner safety of 
processes used by aircraft builders, the airline industry and their regulators and to 
explore their impact on airliner structural design. This will allow an aircraft designer to 
present to a customer the choice between designing more safety into the airplane 
versus achieving the same level of safety though maintenance and training 
procedures. Inspired by a crash of an American Airlines airplane due to extreme 
rudder commands, the research will also explore a new approach for reducing 
unexpected failures by simulations of extreme behavior by a pilot. The research thus 
addresses a critical lack in the current design framework of complex systems by 
systematically uncovering processes of unexpected and un-modeled failure scenarios 
and by including operators‘ extreme behavior into the design and safety assessment. 
If successful, the research will provide insight for aircraft builders, airlines, Congress 
and the President on strategies to improve safety at less cost, resulting in more 
efficient resource allocation at the national level. This can help decisions on directing 
resources to safety research, tax incentives to aircraft builders, maintenance and pilot 
training and regulations and accident investigations. Although the proposed research 
focuses on aircraft structures, the same frameworks can be applicable to any 
complex engineering system whose safety depends on a sequence of processes 
throughout its life cycle. This includes infrastructural systems, whose reliability is 
directly related to public safety. The research results will be widely distributed for 
maximum impact in a variety of conference and journal venues. 
2. The Dynamical Systems (DS) funding program that supports innovative 
research on the theories of dynamical systems, including new analytical and 
computational tools, as well as the novel application of dynamical systems to 
108 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
engineered systems. The program is especially interested in transformative 
research in the area of complex systems, uncertain or stochastic nonlinear 
dynamical systems, model order reduction of nonlinear or infinite dimensional 
dynamical systems, discrete nonlinear dynamical systems, and modeling, 
simulation, analysis and design of multi-scale multi-physics dynamical systems. 
Example of the recent award made through this program: 
Unified Model and Robotic Implementation of Bio-Inspired Walking and Running. 
Start Date: September 1, 2011. Expires: August 31, 2014 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $499 320. Sponsor: Carnegie-Mellon University. 
The research objectives of this award are to develop and implement a 
biomechanically relevant, unified theory of legged dynamics that spans walking and 
running, and to demonstrate this theory on a new bipedal robot, ATRIAS. To date, a 
legged machine whose dynamic behavior can approach the performance of human 
walking and running, including transitions between these two gaits, does not exist. 
The research will result in principled models of gait and gait transitions with human-
like leg dynamics, in generalized models for manipulating cyclic hybrid dynamic 
systems to achieve different goal behaviors, and in the verification and demonstration 
of this new scientific understanding with a bipedal robot. The research progresses 
from analyzing simplified gait models that capture the essential dynamics of human 
locomotion to integrating these modules in a core dynamics model of human gait. 
Goal behavior manipulations will be approached using the influence of parameters on 
the shape of the Poincare map in these cyclic dynamic systems. Experimental 
verification on the robot will demonstrate and refine the theoretical progress. 
Deliverables include modeling and simulation software, experimental verification and 
demonstration on robot hardware, documentation of research results, and 
engineering student education and research experience. 
The results of this research will provide the opportunity to create control algorithms for 
powered legged systems that enable functionally versatile behaviors similar to 
animals and humans. Examples include prosthetic legs and exoskeletons that provide 
human users with human-like leg dynamics during walking, running, and the 
transitions between these gaits. Other examples include legged robots that achieve 
robust and efficient dynamic turning behaviors. The results will be disseminated to 
encourage commercial applications and further development. A simulation of the 
robot implementation of the results will be posted online to engage healthy 
competition in the development of control algorithms for powered legs. 
3. The control systems (CS) funding program that supports innovative research 
on control theory and control technology driven by real life applications. The 
program accepts proposals on transformative research in established topic areas 
such as model-based control. However, the program emphasis is on paradigm-
shifting ideas for control strategies that may be inspired by nature, 
unconventional applications, and the combined role of feedback and uncertainty 
in systems that incorporate large numbers of sensors and actuators. New sensor 
and actuator concepts that integrate feedback and signal processing to achieve a 
sensing or actuation objective are also funded.

Example of the recent award made through this program: 
Reference and Extended Command Governors for Constrained Control: Theory and 
Applications. 
Start Date: September 1, 2011. Expires: August 31, 2014 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $339 037. Sponsor: University of Michigan Ann Arbor. 
The objectives of this research are to advance Reference and Extended Command 
Governor control theory and algorithms for systems, such as downsized systems, that 
can presently fail to perform optimally due to lack of ability to handle stringent state 
and control constraints. The Governors are predictive control algorithms that augment 
high performance feedback loops and modify reference commands to protect the 
system from constraint violation. In this research, Reference and Extended Command 
Governor methods are developed for: (a) systems with fast and slow dynamics, (b) 
linear systems with nonlinear constraints, (c) systems with dynamics evolving on lie 
groups, (d) systems with dynamic disturbance models, and (e) for the case when 
Governors are placed inside intentionally or unintentionally created feedback loops. 
The research progresses from developing the theory and algorithms, to treating high 
impact automotive and aerospace applications using simulations and experiments, to 
disseminating research results for academic and industrial audience, and to 
incorporating research results into courses to enhance student education. 
This research has a potential to benefit automotive and aerospace transportation, 
energy efficiency, environment, defense, and maintaining space infrastructure. 
Specifically, the advances made will: (a) enable higher levels of automotive engine 
downsizing and vehicle fuel economy improvements, (b) allow a more aggressive use 
of aircraft gas turbine engines during emergency maneuvering which will increase 
aircraft safety, (c) extend the safe range and mission duration of very flexible aircraft 
(for a variety of commercial and military use), (d) enhance attitude control and safe 
rendezvous and proximity maneuvering capability for autonomous spacecraft, (e) 
improve energy management of automotive and aerospace hybrid power-plants with 
small energy storage. The research results disseminated through publications 
(including a monograph), and implemented in a Matlab toolbox, will support 
researchers, students and practitioners alike in their activities to develop and 
implement the Reference and Extended Command Governors. 
 The Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering 
(CISE/OAD) which has three goals: 
 Enable the U.S. to uphold a position of world leadership in computing, 
communications, and information science and engineering; 
 Promote understanding of the principles and uses of advanced computing, 
communications and information systems in service to society; 
 Contribute to universal, transparent and affordable participation in an 
information-based society. 
To achieve these, CISE supports investigator initiated research in all areas of 
computer and information science and engineering, helps develop and maintain 
cutting-edge national computing and information infrastructure for research and 
education generally, and contributes to the education and training of the next 
generation of computer scientists and engineers. 
110 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
CISE is organized in three divisions: the Division of Computing & Communication 
Foundations (CCF); the Division of Computer and Network Systems (CNS); and the 
Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS). Each division is organized into a 
small number of programs that are responsible for managing a portfoflio of grants and 
proposal competitions within a broad area of research and education. While individual 
program directors may be designated as the point of contact for specific sub-
disciplines, collaboration takes place within each program, across each division, and 
between divisions and directorates. 
As example under the funding opportunities for the CNS Community we found the 
following program solicitation relevant. 
7.7.4 The Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) program Solicitation 11-
516 
The term "cyber-physical systems" refers to the tight conjoining of and coordination 
between computational and physical resources. We envision that the cyber-physical 
systems of tomorrow will far exceed those of today in terms of adaptability, autonomy, 
efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability. Research advances in cyber-
physical systems promise to transform our world with systems that respond more 
quickly (e.g., autonomous collision avoidance), are more precise (e.g., robotic surgery 
and nano-tolerance manufacturing), work in dangerous or inaccessible environments 
(e.g., autonomous systems for search and rescue, firefighting, and exploration), 
provide large-scale, distributed coordination (e.g., automated traffic control), are 
highly efficient (e.g., zero-net energy buildings), augment human capabilities, and 
enhance societal wellbeing (e.g., assistive technologies and ubiquitous healthcare 
monitoring and delivery). 
The CPS program is seeking proposals that address research challenges in three 
CPS themes: Foundations; Methods and Tools; and Components, Run-time 
Substrates, and Systems. Foundations research will develop new scientific and 
engineering principles, algorithms, models, and theories for the analysis and design 
of cyber-physical systems. Research on Methods and Tools will bridge the gaps 
between approaches to the cyber and physical elements of systems through 
innovations such as novel support for multiple views, new programming languages, 
and algorithms for reasoning about and formally verifying properties of complex 
integrations of cyber and physical resources. The third CPS theme concerns new 
hardware and software Components, Run-time Substrates (infrastructure and 
platforms), and (engineered) Systems motivated by grand challenge applications. In 
all CPS themes, concepts should be developed contribute to new Cyber-Physical 
Systems science. These concepts may include fault tolerance, availability, reliability, 
reconfigurability, and cybersecurity aspects of certifiably-dependable CPS. 
Two types of research and education projects will be considered: 
 Medium Projects span one or more CPS themes and include two or more PIs 
and a research team of students and/or postdocs. Funding for Medium Projects 
will be provided at levels ranging from $300,000/year to $500,000/year and 
durations of three to four years; 
 Large Projects are multi-investigator and multi-university projects involving teams 
of researchers and their students and/or postdocs representing multiple 
disciplines in computer science, engineering, and physical application domains, 
which together address a coherent set of research issues that either cut across 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 111 
multiple CPS themes or that explore in great depth a particular theme. Funding 
will be provided at levels up to $1,000,000/year for up to five years. 
Examples of the recent award made through this program: 
CPS: Medium: Collaborative Research: Co-Design of Multimodal CPS Architectures 
and Adaptive Controllers. 
Start Date: October 1, 2011, Expires: September 30, 2015 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $753 000. The sponsor is Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The focus of this project is the efficient implementation of multiple control and non-
control automotive applications in a distributed Embedded system (DES) with a goal 
of developing safe, dependable, and secure Automotive CPS. DESs are highly 
attractive due to the fact that they radically enhance the capabilities of the underlying 
system by linking a range of devices and sensors and allowing information to be 
processed in unprecedented ways. Deploying control and non-control applications on 
a modern DES, which uses advanced processor and communication technology, 
introduces a host of challenges in their analysis and synthesis, and leads to a large 
semantic gap between models and their implementation. This gap will be filled via the 
development of a novel CPS architecture by stitching together common fundamental 
principles of multimodality from real-time systems and related notions of switching in 
control theory and integrating them into a co-design of real-time platforms and 
adaptive controllers. This architecture will be validated at the Toyota Technical Center 
in the context of engine control and diagnostics. 
The results of this project will provide the science and technology for a foundation in 
any and all infrastructure systems ranging from finance and energy to 
telecommunication and transportation where distributed Embedded systems are 
present. In addition to training the graduate and undergraduate students, and 
mentoring a post-doctoral associate who will gain multi-domain expertise in advanced 
control, real-time computation and communication, and performance analysis, an 
inter-school graduate and an integrated summer course will be developed on control 
in Embedded systems and combined with on-going outreach programs at MIT and 
UPenn for minority and women undergraduate students and K-12 students. 
CPS: Medium: Collaborative Research: Smart Power Systems of the Future: 
Foundations for Understanding Volatility and Improving Operational Reliability. 
Start Date: October 1, 2011, Expires: September 30, 2015 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $700 000. The sponsor is Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
This project addresses the impact of the integration of renewable intermittent 
generation in a power grid. This includes the consideration of sophisticated sensing, 
communication, and actuation capabilities on the system's reliability, price volatility, 
and economic and environmental efficiency. Without careful crafting of its 
architecture, the future smart grid may suffer from a decrease in reliability. Volatility of 
prices may increase, and the source of high prices may be more difficult to identify 
because of undetectable strategic policies. This project addresses these challenges 
by relying on the following components: (a) the development of tractable cross-layer 
models; physical, cyber, and economic, that capture the fundamental tradeoffs 
between reliability, price volatility, and economic and environmental efficiency, (b) the 
development of computational tools for quantifying the value of information on 
decision making at various levels, (c) the development of tools for performing 
112 #Interim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 ©2012 IDC 
distributed robust control design at the distribution level in the presence of information 
constraints, (d) the development of dynamic economic models that can address the 
real-time impact of consumer's feedback on future electricity markets, and finally (e) 
the development of cross-layer design principles and metrics that address critical 
architectural issues of the future grid. 
This project promotes modernization of the grid by reducing the system-level barriers 
for integration of new technologies, including the integration of new renewable energy 
resources. Understanding fundamental limits of performance is indispensable to 
policymakers that are currently engaged in revamping the infrastructure of our energy 
system. It is critical that we ensure that the transition to a smarter electricity 
infrastructure does not jeopardize the reliability of our electricity supply twenty years 
down the road. The educational efforts and outreach activities will provide 
multidisciplinary training for students in engineering, economics, and mathematics, 
and will raise awareness about the exciting research challenges required to create a 
sustainable energy future. 
CPS: Large: Assuring the Safety, Security and Reliability of Medical Device Cyber 
Physical Systems. 
Start Date: October 1, 2010, Expires: September 30, 2015 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $2 530 087. The sponsor is Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The objective of this research is to establish a new development paradigm that 
enables the effective design, implementation, and certification of medical device 
cyber-physical systems. The approach is to pursue the following research directions: 
1) to support medical device interconnectivity and interoperability with network-
enabled control; 2) to apply coordination between medical devices to support 
emerging clinical scenarios; 3) to "close the loop" and enable feedback about the 
condition of the patient to the devices delivering therapy; and 4) to assure safety and 
effectiveness of interoperating medical devices. 
The intellectual merits of the project are 1) foundations for rigorous development, 
which include formalization of clinical scenarios, operational procedures, and 
architectures of medical device systems, as well as patient and caregiver modeling; 
2) high-confidence software development for medical device systems that includes 
the safe and effective composition of clinical scenarios and devices into a dynamically 
assembled system; 3) validation and certification of medical device cyber-physical 
systems; and 4) education of the next-generation of medical device system 
developers who must be literate in both computational and physical aspects of 
devices. 
The broader impacts of the project will be achieved in three ways. Novel design 
methods and certification techniques will significantly improve patient safety. The 
introduction of closed-loop scenarios into clinical practice will reduce the burden that 
caregivers are currently facing and will have the potential of reducing the overall costs 
of health care. Finally, the educational efforts and outreach activities will increase 
awareness of careers in the area of medical device systems and help attract women 
and under-represented minorities to the field. 
CPS: Medium: Collaborative Research: Geometric Distributed Algorithms for Multi-
Robot Coordination and Control. 
©2012 IDC #FinalInterim Study Report 2 - Deliverable D4 113 
Start Date: September 15, 2010 Expires: August 31, 2013 (Estimated). Awarded 
Amount to Date: $340 000. The sponsor is Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
The objective of this research is to develop new models of computation for multi-robot 
systems. Algorithm execution proceeds in a cycle of communication, computation, 
and motion. Computation is inextricably linked to the physical configuration of the 
system. Current models cannot describe multi-robot systems at a level of abstraction 
that is both manageable and accurate. This project will combine ideas from 
distributed algorithms, computational geometry, and control theory to design new 
models for multi-robot systems that incorporate physical properties of the systems. 
The approach is to focus on the high-level problem of exploring an unknown 
environment while performing designated tasks, and the sub-problem of maintaining 
network connectivity. Key issues to be studied will include algorithmic techniques for 
handling ongoing discrete failures, and ways of understanding system capabilities as 
related to failure rates, geometric assumptions and physical parameters such as robot 
mobility and communication bandwidth. New metrics will be developed for error rates 
and robot mobility. 
Intellectual merit arises from the combination of techniques from distributed 
algorithms, computational geometry, and control theory to develop and analyze 
algorithms for multi-robot systems. The project will develop a new class of algorithms 
and techniques for their rigorous analysis, not only under ideal conditions, but under a 
variety of error assumptions. The project will test theoretical ideas empirically, on 
three different multi-robot systems. 
Broader impacts will include new algorithms for robot coordination, and rigorous 
understanding of the capabilities of different hardware platforms. Robots are an 
excellent outreach tool, and provide concrete examples of theory in action.
