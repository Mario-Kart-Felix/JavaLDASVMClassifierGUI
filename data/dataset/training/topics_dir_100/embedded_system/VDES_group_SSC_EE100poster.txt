On-Board Image Processing
1. Automatic Image Registration and Change Detection
This research is concerned with  the 
development of an Automatic Change 
Detection System (ACDS) for flood 
monitoring from space. Low-complexity 
mathematical algorithms are investigated
for application on board small satellites. 
2. Multispectral Image Compression
Due to limited bandwidth and restricted storage resources, multispectral 
image compression becomes the most critical on-board processing
requirement. Multispectral images, taken in 3 to 25 bands, have intrinsic
spectral redundancy that can be removed by spectral decorrelation, 
which requires band registration.
3. On-Board Encryption
This research is aimed at an optimal and reliable (fault-tolerant) 
implementation of the AES algorithm so that is satisfies on-board 
resource constraints of small satellites in terms of power, area and 
speed.
Optimization of IEEE 802.11 for Inter-Satellite Links 
ESPACENET: SPACE WIRELESS SENSOR 
NETWORKS
ESPACENET is a £1-million joint project funded by EPSRC. 
The project aims to develop flexible, reconfigurable, evolvable, and 
intelligent multi-spacecraft sensing networks for aerospace-based 
monitoring and diagnostics. A demonstration CubeSat mission is under
development to test novel technologies at LEO, including 1) inter-
satellite communication using WiFi intersatellite links; 2) distributed 
computing within the satellite network based on multi-agent 
communication; 3) reconfigurable computing in space for single event 
upset (SEU) mitigation.
A novel middleware is 
designed to support 
distributed computing in 
satellite clusters:

Satellite-on-a-printed-circuit-board
- 10 x 10 x 2 cm
- 250 g
- 3V, 700 mW
- cost - less than £2,500 for entire satellite
• If spacecraft flying in close 
formation are capable to collaborate, 
they can achieve the mission aims at 
lower costs and with increased 
reliability compared to larger single 
platform missions. 
• In this research we aim to develop 
a distributed computing system 
operating over a network of satellite
nodes for formation flying missions.
• The middleware takes into 
consideration application-specific 
factors, such as, formation flying 
dynamics, unreliable inter-satellite 
links and highly resource-
constrained nodes (in terms of mass 
and power).
• Design requirements include 
scalability, fault-tolerance, low-
power, low memory (both static and 
dynamic) requirements and real-
time performance.

• A generic single-chip computing 
platform for use on board small 
spacecraft, which can be reconfigured 
locally or remotely is designed. 
• The platform features a highly 
modular structure that can be 
quickly and easily customised to 
produce specific purpose controllers 
for data processing, communication 
and control of different spacecraft subsystems and payload blocks. 
• Targeted at SRAM-based FPGAs, the system is capable of partial run-
time reconfiguration, which allows electronic circuits on-board satellites to 
upgrade/self-repair faulty blocks while the remaining part of the system is 
fully operational.
•The concept of SoC-based reconfigurable computing on board satellites 
was pioneered in a paper published at the MAPLD’00 conference, is now 
widely adopted by spacecraft designers all over the world.
Ground Station Design 
Requirements for new space system architectures are now emerging
for numerous applications. Analogous to proliferating terrestrial 
wireless sensor networks, massively distributed space sensor 
networks will enable the observation of real-time multi-point 
phenomenology. Novel cost-effective, mass-producible solutions are 
under investigation and development including satellite-on-a-chip 
(SpaceChip), satellite-on-a-printed circuit board (PCBSat), and 
satellite-on-a multichip module (MCMSat). Our focus is on ensuring 
the survivability and power efficiency of these technologies.
