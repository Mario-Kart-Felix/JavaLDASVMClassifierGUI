The Birth of “Societal IT Systems (SiS)”
• The Emerging Service Models
– Intelligent data access and extraction
– Immersion-based work and play
– Environmental control, energy management and safety in “high- 
performance” homes
– Automotive and avionic safety and control
– Management of metropolitan traffic flows
– Distributed health monitoring
– Power distribution with decentralized energy generation
“A complex collection of sensors, controllers, compute 
nodes, and actuators that work together to improve our 
daily lives”
Societal IT Systems – 
What it means for Wireless
• From the Very Small
– Ubiquitous, Pervasive
– Disappearing
– Perceptive, Ambient
• To the Very Large
– Always connectable – whatever happens
– Absolutely reliable
– Scalable, Adaptive, Flexible
Major Progress but True Immersion Still Out of Reach
Artificial Skin
Smart Objects
“Microscopic” Health Monitoring
Interactive Surfaces
Another leap in size, cost  and energy reduction
SiS Wireless – The Very Large
• Reliable universal coverage at all times!?
– 7 trillion radios will quickly run out of spectrum …
– Wireless is notoriously unreliable
» Fading, interference, blocking
– Mobility requires dynamic reconfiguration
– Heterogeneity causes incompatibilities
» Large number of standards to co-exist
» Devices vary in form-factor, size and energy source

“Borrowing” Spectrum
A World with Unlimited Wireless Bandwidth and 
Always-On Coverage?
• Cognitive capabilities of terminals offer prospect of 
dramatic increase in attainable wireless data-rates
– Spectrum becomes a dynamic commodity
• Collaboration among terminals and infrastructure 
essential to accomplish cognitive promises, while 
providing reliability
– Enables multi-modal operation (e.g. in emergencies)
– Opens door for collaboration  between heterogeneous 
services or standards
• Connectivity Brokerage as the new operational (as 
well as business) paradigm

– Sense the spectral environment over a

– Reliably detect presence/absence of 
primary users and/or interferers
– Rules of sharing the available 
resources (time, frequency, space)
– Flexibility to adjust to changing 
circumstances (power, freq. band)
Cognitive terminal
First Experiment in 
Cognitive: 
TV Bands @ 700 MHz
(IEEE 802.22)
The Power of Collaboration
Conventional wireless mindset: 
• Services compete!
» Example: Bluetooth, WIFI and Zigbee
• Adding terminals degrades user capacity
Collaboration as a means to improve spectrum utilization!
A single terminal or base-station has 
only limited perspective
Working together leads to better 
capacity, coverage and/or reliability
Examples: multi-hop,
collaborative diversity
[Ref: Ozgur/Leveque/Tse’07] [Ref: Gupta/Kumar’00]
Cognitive-Collaborative Networks: 
The Challenges
• How to manage degrees of freedom?
– Frequency/spatial utilization, collaboration, topology
• So that some global and user goals are met
– Cost, User experience, Life time
• While …
– Providing absolute reliability
– Hiding complexity
– Providing security and access control
– Dealing with legacy systems
A Societal IT System on Its Own!
Making Cognitive/Collaborative Work
Connectivity Brokerage (*) as a Distributed OS
Functional entity that enables collection of terminals to transparently 
connect to backbone network or each other to perform set of services
While optimizing 
utilization of spectrum 
under policy rules, rules 
of engagement and 
security constraints.

Next Generation SCADA/DCS Systems
• IEEE definition for a SCADA 
System: 
– All control, indication, 
and associated 
telemetering equipment 
at the master station, and 
all of the complementary 
devices at  the RTU(s).  
(C37.1-1994)
• DCS: Digital Control 
Systems
– The overall collection of 
control systems  that 
measure and change the 
infrastructure  state to 
facilitate delivery of the 
commodity  (electricity, 
water, gas, & oil)
• Wireless Sensor Networks; 
next Generation SCADA
~2 Square Miles,  1400 Employees, 40 years old
Infrastructure $ 10 B,  Budget $200M+/year
Primary products:  Chlorine, Silica, Caustics
Highly profitable facility
DHS, OSHA, EPA compliance
Industrial Automation
• Motivation: Cost reduction
– More than 85% reduction in cost 
compared to wired systems (case study 
by Emerson)
– SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data 
Acquisition) 
• Reliability is the number one issue
– Robust estimation: Estimation of 
parameters of interest from noisy 
measurements with high fidelity in the 
presence of unreliable communication 
– Real-time control: A must for mission-

Taxonomy of Security Attacks in 
Sensor Networks
Threat Model
• Mote-class Attacker
– Controls a few ordinary sensor nodes
– The attacker has the same capabilities as the network 
• Laptop-class Attacker
– Greater battery & processing power, memory, high-power radio 
transmitter, low-latency communication
– The attacker can cause more serious damage
• Outsider Attacks
– Passive eavesdropping: listening to the ongoing communication
– Denial of service attacks: any type of attack that can cause a 
degradation in the performance of the network
– Replay attacks: the adversary captures some of the messages, 
and plays them back at a later time which cause the network to 
operate on stale information
• Insider Attacks: compromised node
– Node runs malicious code
– The node has access to the secret keys and can participate in the 
authenticated communication.

SPINS: Security Protocols for Sensor Networks  (Perrig et. al)
TinySec: Link Layer encryption for tiny devices (Karlof et. al)
Robust aggregation:
Given the redundancy of the data gathered by the sensor nodes, 
in-network processing is an essential task in sensor networks
Data aggregation is extremely prone to insider attacks who inject 
faulty data into the network
SIA: Secure Information Aggregation for Sensor Networks (Przydatek 
et. al) 
Resilient Aggregation in Sensor Networks (Wagner)
Sybil Attack:
In this attack a node pretends to have multiple identities, or the 
adversary creates node identities that do not exist in the network
Countermeasures for Sybil attack (Perrig et. al)
Other Attacks and Countermeasures
Secure location verification: 
The goal is to validate the claims of nodes
Verification of Location Claims (N. Sastry, et. al)
Robust localization: 
localization is used to find the position of the nodes
Statistical Methods for Robust Localization (Z. Li, et. al)

Key distribution protocols:
Used for distributing the cryptographic keys in the network 
after deployment
