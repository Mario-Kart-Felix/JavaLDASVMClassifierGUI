Designer’s program
 
Software Technology 
Following your Master’s graduation, you can 
continue on to the Software Technology (ST) 
Designer’s program within the Computer Science 
graduate program.
High-tech industry needs experienced designers 
able to design complex new products and 
processes. A Master’s degree can give you the 
requisite theoretical knowledge but it does not 
provide a lot of practical experience. A Designer’s 
program gives you that practical experience, which 
boosts your market value for industry. You graduate 
with a Professional Doctorate in Engineering 
(PDEng) degree.
The Software Technology program begins with a 
15-month series of short courses and workshops 
and short industrial design projects. This is 
followed by a major in-company design assignment 
of nine months. 
The development of software for advanced 
systems covers a wide range of different aspects. 
The Software Technology program devotes a lot 
of attention to the project-based design and 
development of software for resource-constrained, 
software-intensive systems such as real-time 
embedded systems. 
- Study possibilities: Full-time
- Degree: Professional Doctorate in Engineering
- Language: English
- Times of entry: Once a year (around October 1)
- Duration: 2 years
- www.tue.nl/graduateprograms/cs
The Technological Designer’s programs are 
coordinated in the 3TU.School for Technological 
Design, Stan Ackermans Institute. The institute 
represents the three universities of technology in 
the Netherlands and was established in mid-2006.
PhD programs
A PhD study at TU/e typically takes four years. 
During this period you receive scientific training 
and, most importantly, you perform research 
under the guidance of and in collaboration with 
your supervisor(s). The research areas covered 
by the sub-department are Algorithms and 
Visualization, Information Systems, Model-Driven 
Software Engineering, and Security and Embedded 
Networked Systems. In each of these areas we 
have internationally recognized research groups. 
In the Netherlands, PhD students are (fixed-term) 
university employees. This means you get a salary, 
and benefit from all the facilities offered by the 
department. Successful completion of the PhD 
program results in a PhD degree, which provides 
a solid basis for a career in academia or in an 
industrial research lab.

Graduate Program
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (W&I) at the Eindhoven Univer-
sity of Technology (TU/e) offers undergraduate (Bachelor of Science), graduate (Master of
Science) and postgraduate (PhD, PDEng) courses in Computer Science and Applied Math-
ematics.
The Computer Science Division (CS) focuses on Specification and Verification, Algo-
rithms and Visualization, Software and Systems Engineering, Information Systems, and
Security. The CS Division offers its graduate and postgraduate courses in the Computer
Science Graduate Program. There are three master programs, one of which has two special
tracks (extra specialization, within the master program CSE). Each of the three master pro-
grams also has a special track within EIT, the European Institute of Technology. The EIT
tracks are described in a separate section (9) of this document.
 Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). This master program has a special track
on Information Security Technology (IST), an interdisciplinary variant in cooperation
with the Mathematics Division of the TU/e and the Radboud University Nijmegen,
and a special track on Data Science in Engineering (DSE), an interdisciplinary variant
in cooperation with the Mathematics Division of the TU/e.
 Business Information Systems (BIS), an interdisciplinary master program in coopera-
tion with the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences (IE&IS).
 Embedded Systems (ES), an interdisciplinary master program in cooperation with the
Department of Electrical Engineering (EE).
The two postgraduate programs are:
 Software Technology, a Master of Technological Design (PDEng) program,
 The PhD program.
The CS Division also contributes to the Computer Science specialization of the master
program Science Education and Communication (SEC), offered by the Eindhoven School
9
10 Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program
of Education (ESoE), see http://www.tue.nl/esoe. Graduates in the CS specialization
from the program are entitled to teach computer science at Dutch high schools. Gradu-
ates from one of the above mentioned master programs will also be admitted to the SEC-
program and are offered a one-year program. Since 2009, double-degree programs are of-
fered for CSE & SEC (see Section 3.5), as well as for BIS & SEC (see Section 6.5), which
comprise 150 credits.
The TU/e also strives to make it possible to obtain a teaching degree by taking a special
45 ECTS program from the ESoE offering as part of several “regular” masters, thus without
going for a double master degree. (The current legal requirement is 60 ECTS. We will keep
you informed if and when a 45 ECTS teaching degree becomes possible.)
1.1 Structure of the master programs
All programs comprise two years of study or 120 credit points (ects); a credit point is equiv-
alent to 28 hours of study and homework for an average student. Most courses are stan-
dardized to 5 credit points per course.
The two years of course work and practical training are divided into four parts, consist-
ing of:
1. Mandatory core courses to create a sufficient layer of theory and general or program-
related knowledge.
2. Elective courses to prepare for the specialization. Depending on the specialization
there may be a longer or shorter list of preferred electives. In addition there is room
for free electives. Most of the master programs are organized in streams. You choose a
stream (with corresponding core courses and/or elective package) when you start the
master. You are allowed to switch between streams after the start, provided that you
can still fulfill the requirements of the stream you wish to switch to.
3. International experience. Students who do not have any international experience (a
degree from another country or at least 15 ECTS of credits from a university outside
the Netherlands) are strongly urged to take courses abroad or to do an internship
abroad.
4. Master project and thesis to be spent on a specialist topic of theoretical or practical
nature. This part presents the opportunity to show your independent engineering and
academic skills in research and design. (International experience can also be gained
by doing the master project abroad.)
1.2 Lecture and interim examination periods
Each study year is divided into two semesters (September to January and February to July).
Each semester consists of two quarters (quartiles), each consisting of eight weeks of lectures
followed by an examination period of two weeks. For details see the agendas and calendars
at http://owinfo.tue.nl/.
Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program 11
Quarter Period
1 August 31, 2015 – November 8, 2015
2 November 9, 2015 – January 31, 2016
3 February 1, 2016 – April 17, 2016
4 April 18, 2016 – July 3, 2016
interim August 8, 2016 – August 13, 2015
You are expected to be available and present during all weeks with classes as well as
weeks with exams. Some courses may have activities planned during the exam weeks,
not yet scheduled before the course starts. Going on vacation during weeks with classes
or with exams is not a valid reason for missing an activity!
1.3 Course and exam registration
Participation in a course is possible only if you have registered for the course via OASE.
In the first quarter, the registration deadline is set at the end of the first lecture week. In
the remaining quarters, this deadline is in the week before the lectures start. During the
registration period, and in the first two lecture weeks, it is possible to withdraw from the
course via OASE yourself. Outside this period, you should contact the lecturer and the
study advisor if you wish to withdraw. (The lecturer has no authorization to register or
deregister students in OASE.)
Important note, especially for Bachelor College graduates: Registration for a course
does not constitute an automatic registration for the exam. You have to register for each
exam separately via OASE (http://education.tue.nl/) before the set deadlines.
Note that if you are not registered for an exam, you cannot take part in it. (The lecturer has
no authorization to register students for the exam.) For courses that are evaluated through
assignments you do not need to register for the exam as there is no exam.
1.4 Examination and titles
In an examination at the end of the program the examination committee verifies and judges
the final course results and the final master project grade. Completion of the program will
lead to the title: Master of Science (MSc) with addition of the name of the program. Graduates
are also entitled to use the Dutch title of ingenieur (ir).
1.5 Admissions
General and specific master program requirements are applicable to admissions. The spe-
cific requirements may be higher in terms of knowledge prerequisites, but may also pro-
vide more possibilities for entry for students from other related areas of specialization. The
specific requirements for admission to each of the master programs are described in the
corresponding chapters.
12 Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program
1.5.1 General admissions requirements
To be eligible for admission to any of the master programs, a Bachelor of Science degree is
required. This degree must be of an equivalent academic level and approximate scientific
content as the corresponding Dutch BSc degrees. In addition, sufficient proficiency in the
English language is required.
1.5.2 Admissions with deficiencies
For admitted students from other universities, it may be necessary to repair deficiencies
due to differences in programs. The admission committee will point out those so-called
homologation courses to the students directly or via the study advisor.
Students coming from other disciplines at the three Dutch technical universities may be
admissible after they followed a deficiency or “homologation” program of up to 30 credits.
The disciplines in question are mentioned in the “3TU-doorstroommatrix”, the correspond-
ing deficiency program is constructed on an individual basis.
1.5.3 Foreign students
The applications of students with a foreign university BSc degree will be evaluated by the
admissions committee, taking into account both the academic level of the degree and the
subjects studied by the applicant. Here too a homologation program may be required. In
some special cases, relevant work experience may also be considered. The level of the de-
gree is determined by the national organization NUFFIC (www.nuffic.nl).
1.5.4 Polytechnic graduates (HBO)
Students who have completed a polytechnic program may be eligible to participate in the
pre-master programs. Completion of the pre-master program gives access to the corre-
sponding master program. In Chapter 2 further details about admission for HBO students
and the premaster program can be found.
1.5.5 Admissions procedure
The procedure to be followed depends on your particular situation. Detailed information
on the application procedure can be found on the site of the Education and Student Service
Center of the TU/e, http://www.tue.nl/en/education/. Foreign students must be
aware that the admissions procedure, including visa application and other formalities, may
take a considerable amount of time. In order to avoid delay in the start of your master study
it is important to register and start the application procedure long in advance.
1.6 International Experience
All students are strongly urged to gain some international experience. Students who do
not have a degree or certificate(s) for at least 15 ECTS obtained from a university in an-
other country should gain that experience during their master study. Several options are
available:
Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program 13
 Take subjects at a university abroad (at least 15ects)
 Do an internship abroad (at least 15 ects, which is roughly 3 months)
 Do the graduation project abroad
Your mentor (see section 1.7) will help you in choosing the best option for you and assist
you in consulting the study advisor for programmatic issues. For organizational issues, the
international affairs coordinator provides assistance. The contact person is mrs Elle van den
Hurk bc., Room MF 5.099, International.office.win@tue.nl.
You need to deal with practical organizational aspects yourself. The Education and Stu-
dent Service desk has a handy checklist; it can be found on http://w3.tue.nl/en/
services/stu/. In a number of cases it is possible to obtain a scholarship that helps
overcome financial hurdles of going abroad. A good starting point for scholarships is
http://www.beursopener.nl/.
1.7 Mentoring
Within the first few weeks of your study a mentor will be assigned to you. The mentor
will advise you with regards to the development of your professional skills (which includes
assessment and training by the TU/e Skills Lab, see http://skillslabtue.nl/) and
will help you in making the first choices for electives and in deciding which specialization
best suits your interests.
At some point during your study your specialization will become clearer. This typically
happens between the end of the second and fourth quarter. Your mentor will then help
you in choosing new mentor from the group that best matches that specialization. The new
mentor will then help you in selecting elective courses to prepare you for doing a master
project in your area of interest and in selecting a trajectory for getting international experi-
ence (if needed). For more procedural aspects of your study such as obtaining approval of
your study program and getting official permission to start your master project you should
consult the study advisor (see section 1.13).
For the academic year 2015-2016 the mentors (for all masters) from the subdepartment
Computer Science of the department of Mathematics and Computer Science are:
Algorithms: prof. dr. Mark de Berg
Applied Geometric Algorithms: prof. dr. Bettina Speckmann
Architecture of Information Systems: dr. Dirk Fahland
Formal System Analysis: prof. dr. Jan-Friso Groote
Security: dr. Nicola Zannone
Software Engineering and Technology: dr. Ruurd Kuiper
System Architecture and Networking: dr. Rudolf Mak
Visualization: prof. dr. Jack van Wijk
Web Engineering: dr. ir. Joaquin Vanschoren
For Embedded Systems and Business Information Systems there may also be mentors avail-
able from the department of Electrical Engineering (for ES) and from the department of
Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences (for BIS).
14 Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program
1.8 Internship
An internship is mostly performed to fulfill the international experience part of the master
program. Students who already have international experience when entering the master
will typically not perform an internship but complete their study program with elective
courses. In some of these cases, however, an internship may be a valuable addition to
the program also for students who do not need international experience in their master,
provided that it enhances practical experience, provides deepening of knowledge, and con-
tributes to the specialization. An internship takes 15 credit points as part of the electives.
Doing an internship requires approval from the internship coordinator dr. J.P. Veltkamp.
This approval must be obtained in advance. The procedure consists of:
 a form to be handed in with the internship coordinator;
 a request stating what is to be accomplished in the internship and why it is important
for the coherence of your study program. (You may ask your mentor, graduation
supervisor or the study advisor for advice on internships and on the coherence of your
program as a whole. These topics are also addressed in the Program and Examinations
Regulations.)
1.9 Admission to seminars, capita selecta, master project
Capita selecta courses are occasional educational elements, often with a research flavor.
They may be experimental courses, a lecture series given by a visitor, or a special individual
assignment as a preparation on future research. The capita selecta can be followed only by
permission of the responsible lecturer. Students do not have a “right” to do these courses,
but they may be granted the possibility.
The seminars, capita selecta, and master project are only open to students that are fully
admitted. This means that they are not available for students that do not yet have their BSc
diploma or students that did not yet complete the premaster. Students are only allowed
to take a seminar when they are at least in the fourth quarter of their study. Students that
still have deficiencies (e.g. uncompleted homologation courses) are not allowed to start the
master project. Each master program has additional specific rules regarding permission to
start the master program and the allowed choices of graduation advisor.
1.10 Approval of study program
The Examinations Committee must approve your program consisting of the mandatory
courses and your choice of the electives (possibly including an internship). In order to
obtain this approval you construct a program, possibly with the help of your mentor and
study advisor, fill out the program form, sign it, get it approved by the master thesis super-
visor of your choice (or another representative of the same research group) and hand it in
at the student administration office (MF 5.103). To make sure you do not miss courses you
should choose it is recommended to submit your study program around the start of quarter
3 of your first year. If needed you can still make changes later and reapply for approval.
Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program 15
1.11 Honors program
The Honors program is aimed at excellent students from one of the Master programs of-
fered by the Computer Science sub-department: Business Information Systems, Computer
Science and Engineering, Data Science in Engineering, Information Security Technology,
and Embedded Systems.
The goal of the program is to give these students the opportunity to participate in and
contribute to the research being done at the department. Concretely, the Honors program
consists of:
 Two projects for 6 ects each, one in semester 1B of the Master program and one in
semester 2A. These projects can be research-oriented or design-oriented and are done
in different research groups in the department. The exact contents of the projects is
determined by the supervisor of the research group where the project is done, in con-
sultation with the student. The expected outcome of the project is a paper (published
as a technical report of the department, and possibly also elsewhere).
 Beside the projects, the student participates in other activities of the research group
(for example in research seminars) and is encouraged to participate in activities orga-
nized by one of the national Dutch research schools (ASCI, IPA, or SIKS). The latter
activities are typically short courses or conferences.
Note that the Honors program is done on top of the regular Master program, that is, the
12 ects do not count towards the 120 credits you need to accumulate for your Master pro-
gram. Students who successfully complete the Honors program will receive a certificate
upon graduation.
Participating in the Honors program is especially useful if you are interested in taking a
PhD later on, since it allows you to experience what it is like to do research in two different
areas. But above all, the Honors program is challenging and fun.
The program is aimed at highly motivated excellent students (among the top 10% of
the Master students in the department) who had outstanding grades in their Bachelor pro-
grams and scored high grades during the first semester of the Master program (average at
least 8). For admission to the honors program, an application procedure applies. Detailed
instructions for application and the deadline will be announced by e-mail to all students in
February of each year.
More information about the honors program can be obtained from the honors program
coordinator prof.dr. Mark de Berg, e-mail m.t.d.berg@TUE.nl.
1.12 Internal quality assurance
After each semester the individual courses as well as the program are evaluated by the ed-
ucational management and the study program committee. Based on this evaluation follow-
up actions for improvement are defined if necessary. Input for the evaluation sessions are
statistical data on the examination results, and the aggregated results from the semester
questionnaires for students. It is of vital importance that students cooperate in this respect
since only questionnaires with a sufficient number of respondents are taken into considera-
tion. Apart from that, the examinations committee periodically carries out an investigation,
16 Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program
in particular on the quality of the graduation projects and the quality of (partial) interim
examinations.
The opinion of students on the quality of their graduation project and process is gathered
by means of a graduation questionnaire, which is filled in after the assessment of the grad-
uation project. These are collected and aggregated once a year. The results are discussed
both in the study program committee and examinations committee.
1.13 Study advisor
The master study advisor for all programs is dr. Peter Veltkamp.
Office: MF 5.102
E-mail: j.p.veltkamp@tue.nl
Phone: 040 247 2763
Consulting hours: Monday, Tuesday and Thursday from 17:00 to 18:00 (or later if neces-
sary) based on appointments (see below). Walk-in hour without ap-
pointment is often possible on Thursdays from 12.30 to 13.30, except
when the study advisor is not in office then (check with the Study Pro-
gram Secretariat)
1.13.1 Making an appointment with the study advisor
Since the study advisor must handle all master students in all master programs from the
Computer Science Graduate Program you need to make an appointment before meeting in
person. This prevents long queues and waiting times.
In order to make an appointment, send your request to the Study Program Secretariat
secretariaat.opleiding.win@tue.nl at least one working day before you want to come. They
will send you a form in which you are asked to indicate the topic of your visit and the
preferred day (see above). After returning the form you will receive a meeting request with
an exact time and a time slot of 15 or 30 minutes (see below). Please decline if the time
does not suit you, otherwise accept. If you are unable to come to a set appointment, please
inform the secretariat as soon as possible (e-mail, decline the appointment or call either
(040-)2475630 or (040-)2474501) so that the time slot can be given to someone else.
15 minute slot: For approval of a graduation plan. Please ensure that the form is filled out
completely, that you have collected all required signatures, that you have a
separate problem description, and that your individual study program has
been approved already.
30 minute slot: For all other cases.
In case you are not able to visit the study advisor during his consulting hours, you can
make an appointment for a meeting at another time.
1.14 After graduation
As an MSc graduate from the Computer Science Graduate Program, you are optimally pre-
pared for a broad range of ICT-related jobs. However, you might consider to qualify your-
self further for special jobs like system or software architect or for an academic career. In
Studying in the Computer Science Graduate Program 17
the latter case, the department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers the following
opportunities.
1.14.1 Software Technology PDEng degree program
The Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) degree program in Software Technology
is provided in the context of the 3TU School for Technological Design, the Stan Ackermans
Institute.
It is an accredited and challenging two-year post-graduate-level engineering degree pro-
gram during which its trainees focus on strengthening their technical and non-technical
competences related to the effective and efficient design and development of software-
intensive systems, such as real-time embedded systems, in an industrial setting. The em-
phasis is on large-scale project-based design and development of this kind of software.
The various parts of the PDEng degree program aid to develop the capability of individ-
uals to work within a professional context. It advocates a scientific research based approach
to solving problems, a systematic way of collecting evidence and a critical, reflective, and
independent mind for the analysis and interpretation of evidence.
It adds an additional dimension to a full MSc. program by extending it and integrating it
with new elements. The emphasis is on developing and strengthening (exercising) the com-
petencies necessary for finding technical solutions. For finding such solutions, an effective
collaboration with representatives of different domains is inevitable, and this is practiced
during the program. During the program, the PDEng trainees focus on systems architecting
and designing software for software-intensive systems in multiple application domains for
the High Tech Industry.
After successfully completing all requirements, trainees are awarded a Professional Doc-
torate in Engineering degree. More information can be found on: http://www.tue.nl/
softwaretechnology
1.14.2 PhD programs
When pursuing an academic career, the first step is to obtain a doctorate. A PhD program
is an individual four year program, dedicated to sharpen your research skills. You are typ-
ically hired on a specific research project and become part of the scientific staff of the re-
search group in which the project takes place. Your main task is to perform research under
the guidance of and in collaboration with the supervisor(s) appointed by the Department.
At the end of the four-year period, a PhD thesis is written on the research results. You do
not only perform research, but also receive scientific training and training related to profes-
sional skills and personal development.

Computer Science and Engineering
The Master program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) gives a broad view of
computer science from both a scientific and an engineering perspective, and provides am-
ple opportunities for specialization. The program offers three different streams: Software
Science, Systems Science, and Web Science and the possibility to follow a program partly
outside these streams, for instance to prepare for getting a teaching degree. Each stream
has a core program of five courses. There is a large list of stream electives from which you
should choose some courses to prepare for your master project. There is also ample room
in the program to choose electives from outside your stream. Apart from the three streams
there are also two special tracks: Data Science in Engineering and Information Security
Technology. These are described in separate chapters in this document.
After taking some courses, you will probably have a more clear picture of the academic
direction you want to pursue in your studies. If not, you may want to talk to several staff
members or the study advisor. In the specialization for your subject, there are people that
you may want to be involved with for your final master project (see Section 3.4). In order
to compose a well-balanced program that provides adequate prerequisites for this project,
it is advisable to first choose and consult a project supervisor in the specialization of your
interest before choosing elective courses. As a rule of thumb, you should start your search
for a supervisor and the construction of your individual program not later than at the end
of your first year.
3.1 Admission
A Bachelor degree in Computer Science obtained at a Dutch university provides direct ad-
mission to the CSE program. Students with a different degree and from foreign universities
have to apply for admission via the admission committee. Dutch HBO graduates have to
take a pre-master program before they can be admitted, see Section 2.1.
The admission procedure is described in Section 1.5, and the requirements are listed in
the Teaching and Examination Regulations (see Appendix A.1).

3.2 Learning outcomes
A graduate from the master program
 is qualified to degree level within the domain of science, engineering and technology;
 is competent in the relevant domain-specific discipline, namely computer science and
engineering;
 is capable of acquiring knowledge independently;
 approaches computer-science problems in a thorough and scientifically founded man-
ner;
 is capable of critical thinking, can reason logically and form opinions;
 has design skills, presentation skills, and communication skills;
 has insight into the role of computer science in industry, society, and science;
 and, in addition to a recognizable domain-specific profile, possesses a sufficiently
broad basis to be able to work in an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary context.
In addition to these general learning outcomes, CSE graduates should also be experts in the
subarea of computer science that they specialize in.
3.3 Curriculum 2015
The Master program Computer Science and Engineering is a two-year program of 120 ECTS
in total. The academic year is subdivided into two semesters, the fall semester starting in
September, and the spring semester starting in February. It is possible to enter the program
at the start of either semester; however, starting in September is preferred. The program is
only offered as a full time study program.
The CSE curriculum is structured in streams, which provide an organized set of courses
in particular subject areas within computer science. The streams provide guidance for the
directions in which you can specialize, and ensure that you choose a comprehensive and
coherent set of courses. When you enroll to the CSE master you should choose a stream
right away because this determines the list of mandatory courses and the assignment of a
mentor. The streams are:
 Software science
 Web science
 Systems science
Each stream has the same structure, as summarized in the following table.
Units ECTS
Mandatory courses 25
Stream electives 25
Free electives 35
Seminar 5
Master project 30
Computer Science and Engineering 27
Each stream has a number of mandatory courses, and a selected set of elective courses from
which at least 25 credit points should be chosen. There is great flexibility in defining the
remaining part of your individual study program from all courses that are offered by the
computer science department (35 credit points). Within this remaining part you should
include 15 credit points in international experience if you do not yet have that and are not
doing your master project abroad. To prepare for the master project, you take a seminar
course from one of the computer science research groups. In the following sections, more
details for each of the streams are given.
3.3.1 Software Science stream
Innovative software systems are the driving force behind many exciting developments in
society, industry, and science. However, designing software systems that function correctly,
efficiently and securely, is far from easy. The CSE stream Software Science focuses on the
formal techniques and technology you need for this. You learn model-driven engineering
techniques to increase the quality of computer programs. As a graduate of the stream Soft-
ware Science, you
 have in-depth knowledge of techniques needed to model and design efficient and re-
liable software
 understand the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and can apply them in
the appropriate situation, taking limitations of cost, time, and other resources into
account
 can analyze existing software systems and understand the fundamental issues in-
volved in software maintenance
The following table lists the mandatory courses and stream electives.

3.3.2 Web Science stream
Over the past decade the use of web-based systems has exploded. Buying clothes, books,
and DVDs, booking hotels, checking the weather forecast, contacting your friends: all of this
is done on the internet nowadays, and novel web-based applications are developed every
day. The CSE stream Web Science focuses on the technology behind these developments.
In the stream you learn techniques needed to design intelligent and reliable web-based sys-
tems, their role in on-line business and you learn to analyze the use of such systems. As a
graduate of the Web Science stream you
 have knowledge of the principles and technologies that drive the Web
 have the skills to design effective web-based systems, and to analyze existing web-
based systems and the data generated through their use
 can design intelligent information services using semantic-web technology or machine-
learning techniques
 have insight into business, privacy and security issues related to web-based systems
If you want to specialize more in the data-analysis aspect of Web Science you should con-
sider the special track on Data Science in Engineering.

3.3.3 Systems Science stream
Modern systems are defined by software. Trends include cloud platforms, consisting of
large connected server farms, and Cyber Physical Systems, with a tight integration of phys-
ical system, control, communication and computation. In the CSE stream Systems Science
you study these new technologies and the process to develop them. Protocols, interfaces
and algorithms need to be designed to improve (energy) efficiency and automation. Larger
systems are never built from scratch anymore, but composed from existing building blocks.
An understanding of the essential structures and behaviors of a system - the architecture,
laid down in models - is therefore essential. Models are further used to validate and moni-
tor required qualities (reliability, robustness, safety, security and privacy), and to drive the
implementation. Experimentation and online methods (like self-monitoring) are essential
ingredients. As a student graduating in the stream Systems Science you
 are familiar with the architectures and architectural principles of large-scale software
systems
 understand the role of models in model-driven systems engineering, and can develop
and use corresponding techniques to design systems with required qualities
 are capable to perform research on processes and tools, as well as on new emerging
technologies.

if you enroll in September, you cannot take the seminars in quarter 2 in your first year, but that
you have to wait until you have entered the second year. Similarly, if you enroll in February, the
seminars in quarter 4 can only be followed in your second year.
2 You can only start the master project if your individual study program has been approved by the
Examinations Committee, and if all homologation units (if any) have been completed successfully,
see also Section 3.4.
3 You have to choose at least 25 credit points from this list.
3.3.4 Free stream
The streams have been set up such that they provide a structured set of courses related to
important topics in computer science. The “free stream” enables you to follow a different
program. In any case you have to take the 5 mandatory courses from one of the predefined
streams (Software Science, Web Science or Systems Science) but then take a set of electives
that does not contain 25 credit points from the stream electives of that stream. You have
to ask permission to the Examinations Committee, and motivate why you cannot set up a
desired individual study program that falls within one of the streams.
A commonly accepted reason for choosing the free stream is to follow a teacher-training
program with courses and other credits from the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE)
Computer Science and Engineering 31
aimed at obtaining a teaching degree (with or without going for a double degree). Instead
of 25 credits in stream electives plus 35 credits in free electives you then take only 15 credits
in electives from your chosen stream plus 45 credits as teacher training program.
3.3.5 Free electives
This section provides a list of courses that are generally recommended for the free electives
space in the curriculum. The list applies to all streams. In principle all master courses
offered at the TU/e can be chosen as free electives so you are not restricted to this list.
Your complete study program including the free electives always requires approval by
the examinations committee. Your mentor will help you to compose a balanced program
that is very likely to be approved.
Some courses may be prescribed as homologation courses (up to 15 credits) to make up
for deficiencies in former education. This prescription is part of the admission decision.
If you do not (yet) have a degree from another country or at least 15 credit points in
international experience you should reserve 15 credits from the room for free electives to
take courses abroad or to do an internship of 15 credits abroad, see Section 1.8. (This does
not apply to students taking the teacher training.)

2 Enrollment (“neveninschrijving”) at Utrecht University is required to follow these courses. Note
that all teaching activities take place in Utrecht. Definitive availability and scheduling depends on
Utrecht University and are not guaranteed when this document is published.
3 Seminars can be taken from the fourth quarter of your study program onwards. This means that
if you enroll in September, you cannot take the seminars in quarter 2 in your first year, but that
you have to wait until you have entered the second year. Similarly, if you enroll in February, the
seminars in quarter 4 can only be followed in your second year.
4 Capita selecta can only be taken with permission of the responsible lecturer. They can be taken at
any time but typically during the second year of your master study.
5 The internship can be followed only after having obtained permission of the internship coordina-
tor.
6 The Seminar algorithms is given in quarter 4 only in 2015-2016. After this academic year it moves
to quarter 6 like most other seminars.
3.4 Final project
The final project of 30 credit points can be completed in any of the research groups in the
CS-division. The practical execution may be performed in industry or a research institute,
in the Netherlands or abroad, as long as a CS staff member is supervising it.
Prior to starting the final project you should first choose and consult the intended final
project supervisor. As final project supervisors can act assistant professors, associate profes-
sors and full professors from the Computer Science sub-department within the Mathematics
and Computer Science department. If you are in doubt how to choose the graduation su-
pervisor please consider contacting your mentor.
The start of your master project is marked by submitting a completed graduation plan
containing the necessary information on the project (name, place, period, supervisor, and so
on), and stating the fact that you have completed your curricular part of the program (see
Section 1.10). The form must be accompanied by a project description and signed by you,
your supervisor, the head of the relevant specialization and the study advisor.
3.4.1 Admission
During the master project, you should be able to work and concentrate on your project full-
time. In practice, however, it turns out to be rather difficult to plan all your curricular ac-
tivities and, especially, their success. If all courses have been completed, permission to start
the master project will be granted. If more than two courses or 10 credit points (whichever
is lower) have not been completed, such permission will not be granted. In other cases (no
more than two courses or 10 credit points not yet completed) it depends on the status of the
uncompleted courses whether permission to start the master project will be granted, and if
so, whether it is feasible to work on the project full time. Courses that are to be taken as ho-
mologation units must be completed and passed before you are allowed to start the master
project. Also, be aware that you are not allowed to finish your project (with presentation
and defense) before you have completed all your courses. For more information, please
contact the study advisor.
34 Computer Science and Engineering
3.4.2 Planning
Together with your supervisor, you decide on a description of your topic and a global plan-
ning. You also arrange the supervision method, including how often you and your supervi-
sor will meet to discuss progress. The project is concluded with a thesis and a presentation
followed by a defense.
In general, the master project should be completed within 6 months from the start. An
extension to 9 months is possible. In exceptional cases, and only if it is clear that the project
can be finished, the exam committee may allow for an additional 3 months period. It is
important to note that the project must be finished within 1 year. A project not finished
within 1 year is automatically cancelled and graded as ”fail”. You then have to start a new
project with a different supervisor. The complete graduation regulations can be found on
the website.
3.4.3 Assessment
Your final project is graded by an assessment committee. The committee usually consists of
your supervisor, a staff member from your specialization area, and a staff member from one
of the other CS research groups. The supervisor is responsible for forming this committee
at least one month before graduation.
The assessment committee takes the following criteria into account:
Results: Significance of the results versus difficulty of the problem or project
goals.
Report: Structure, completeness, correctness, readability, argumentation.
Graduation presentation: Structure, contents, clarity, contact with audience.
Defense: Argumentation, demonstration of knowledge, competency in dis-
cerning main aspects from details of the project.
Execution of the project: Level of independence, planning, organization, handling dead-
lines and setbacks, level of own contribution.
The actual assessment form used by the committee has a more fine-grained list of criteria
for evaluating the work. Not all criteria are equally important. The assessment committee
decides the relative importance of each criterion to arrive at a final grade. The motivation
for the grade is documented in an assessment report, see the website.
3.4.4 Checklist
The graduation checklist (Appendix B) summarizes all the steps required starting with get-
ting your study program approved and ending with the graduation ceremony.
3.5 Double degree program CSE and SEC
The qualification to teach computer science to senior secondary school pupils is coupled to
the 3TU master program Science Education and Communication (SEC). This program en-
compasses 120 credits. In Eindhoven it is offered by the Eindhoven School of Education
(ESoE). In the Education track of the SEC program, a student specializes in one of four dis-
ciplines: maths, physics, chemistry or computer science. Please note that the SEC program
is completely lectured in Dutch!
Computer Science and Engineering 35
BSc graduates in computer science are directly admitted to the SEC-program. So are MSc
graduates from a computer science oriented program; their SEC-program is reduced to 60
credits because of exemptions. For this last category an even shorter route is available by
taking the double degree program, which amounts up to 150 credits. Enrollment is required
for both master programs (one main enrollment and a second enrollment). Certificates will
be granted after completion of the whole program.
Details about the curriculum are available at the ESoE website: http://www.tue.nl/
esoe/.
It is possible to take 45 credits worth of components of the SEC program within the CSE
master. The TU/e strives to have this become sufficient to obtain a teaching qualification
without doing a double degree CSE and SEC master.

Data Science in Engineering
A Master of Science in Data Science in Engineering (DSE) is a multidisciplinary academic
expert in many aspects of handling data and information. Growing amounts of data will
significantly change the jobs of (future) engineers. A data scientist understands how to
transform data into actionalble information that can be used to influence operational pro-
cesses, e.g. reducing waiting times in care processes, improving compliance in banks and
making high-tech systems more robust. To this end the DSE master combines topics from
computer science, mathematics and industrial engineering.
The DSE master is embedded as a special track within the Computer Science and En-
gineering (CSE) master and the Industrial and Applied Mathematics (IAM) master. There
are two streams, leading to a DSE master associated with either the CSE or the IAM master
diploma. This document only describes the Computer Science stream of the DSE master.
After taking some courses, you will probably have a more clear picture of the academic
direction you want to pursue in your studies. If not, you may want to talk to several staff
members or the study advisor. In the specialization for your subject, there are people that
you may want to be involved with for your final master project (see Section 4.4). In order
to compose a well-balanced program that provides adequate prerequisites for this project,
it is advisable to first choose and consult a project supervisor in the specialization of your
interest before choosing elective courses. As a rule of thumb, you should start your search
for a supervisor and the construction of your individual program not later than at the end
of your first year.
4.1 Admission
A Bachelor degree in Computer Science obtained at a Dutch university provides direct ad-
mission to the DSE program. Students with a different degree and from foreign universities
have to apply for admission via the admission committee. Dutch HBO graduates have to
take a pre-master program before they can be admitted, see Section 2.2.
The admission procedure is described in Section 1.5, and the requirements are listed in
the Teaching and Examination Regulations (see Appendix A.1).

4.3 Curriculum 2015
The Master track Data Science in Engineering is a two-year program of 120 ECTS in total.
The academic year is subdivided into two semesters, the fall semester starting in September,
and the spring semester starting in February. It is possible to enter the program at the start
of either semester; however, starting in September is preferred. The program is only offered
as a full time study program.
The DSE curriculum contains courses from computer science and mathematics (and
optional courses also from industrial engineering). The DSE curriculum is structured in
streams, which provide an organized set of courses in particular subject areas within data
science. This document only covers the computer science stream which leads to a diploma
of CSE.
The overall structure of the DSE master is summarized in the following table.
Data Science in Engineering 39

followed all four core courses.
2 Seminars can be taken from the fourth quarter of your study program onwards. This means that
if you enroll in September, you cannot take the seminars in quarter 2 in your first year, but that
you have to wait until you have entered the second year. If you enroll in February, the seminars
are effectively in the fourth quartile of your study.
3 You can only start the master project if your individual study program has been approved by the
Examinations Committee, and if all homologation units (if any) have been completed successfully,
see also Section 3.4.
Note that the Professional Portfolio course in the DSE program is a course shared by the
computer science and the mathematics version (stream) of the Data Science in Engineering
master and it taken from the Industrial and Applied Mathematics master. It consists of lec-
tures during quarter 1 and 2 and a ”Modeling Week” with a “Data Challenge” assignment.
In the modeling week and data challenge students
 gain experience in solving real-life problems
 should report back their findings to the problem owner
 learn to work in groups/teams
 learn how to capture the essence of a practical problem in terms of a mathematical
model
 learn how to extract value from mathematical modelling
 develop a professional attitude when dealing with problems
Every DSE (CS) student must take at least three courses from the list of DSE elective
courses below. (Additional core courses from the list above may also be chosen.) It is rec-
ommended to take more than three but the remaining credit points may also be taken with
courses from the CSE program or from any other master program at the TU/e.

4.3.2 Free electives
In principle all master courses offered at the TU/e can be chosen as free electives. We do
recommend to take more than the required minimum number of courses from the above
lists. In addition other courses from the CSE program, as well as courses from the OML and
BIS masters are recommended.
Your complete study program including the free electives always requires approval by
the examinations committee. Your mentor will help you to compose a balanced program
that is very likely to be approved.
Some courses may be prescribed as homologation courses (up to 15 credits) to make up
for deficiencies in former education. This prescription is part of the admission decision.
If you do not (yet) have a degree from another country or at least 15 credit points in
international experience you should reserve 15 credits from the room for free electives to
Data Science in Engineering 41
take courses abroad or to do an internship of 15 credits abroad, see Section 1.8. (This does
not apply to students taking the teacher training.)
4.4 Final project
Prior to starting the final project you should first choose and consult the intended final
project supervisor. As final project supervisors can act assistant professors, associate pro-
fessors and full professors from the Computer Science sub-department within the Mathe-
matics and Computer Science department. If you are in doubt how to choose the graduation
supervisor please consider contacting your mentor.
The start of your master project is marked by submitting a completed graduation plan
containing the necessary information on the project (name, place, period, supervisor, and so
on), and stating the fact that you have completed your curricular part of the program (see
Section 1.10). The form must be accompanied by a project description and signed by you,
your supervisor, the head of the relevant specialization and the study advisor.
4.4.1 Admission
During the master project, you should be able to work and concentrate on your project full-
time. In practice, however, it turns out to be rather difficult to plan all your curricular ac-
tivities and, especially, their success. If all courses have been completed, permission to start
the master project will be granted. If more than two courses or 10 credit points (whichever
is lower) have not been completed, such permission will not be granted. In other cases (no
more than two courses or 10 credit points not yet completed) it depends on the status of the
uncompleted courses whether permission to start the master project will be granted, and if
so, whether it is feasible to work on the project full time. Courses that are to be taken as ho-
mologation units must be completed and passed before you are allowed to start the master
project. Also, be aware that you are not allowed to finish your project (with presentation
and defense) before you have completed all your courses. For more information, please
contact the study advisor.
4.4.2 Planning
Together with your supervisor, you decide on a description of your topic and a global plan-
ning. You also arrange the supervision method, including how often you and your supervi-
sor will meet to discuss progress. The project is concluded with a thesis and a presentation
followed by a defense.
In general, the master project should be completed within 6 months from the start. An
extension to 9 months is possible. In exceptional cases, and only if it is clear that the project
can be finished, the exam committee may allow for an additional 3 months period. It is
important to note that the project must be finished within 1 year. A project not finished
within 1 year is automatically cancelled and graded as ”fail”. You then have to start a new
project with a different supervisor. The complete graduation regulations can be found on
the website.
42 Data Science in Engineering
4.4.3 Assessment
Your final project is graded by an assessment committee. The committee usually consists of
your supervisor, a staff member from your specialization area, and a staff member from one
of the other CS research groups. The supervisor is responsible for forming this committee
at least one month before graduation.
The assessment committee takes the following criteria into account:
Results: Significance of the results versus difficulty of the problem or project
goals.
Report: Structure, completeness, correctness, readability, argumentation.
Graduation presentation: Structure, contents, clarity, contact with audience.
Defense: Argumentation, demonstration of knowledge, competency in dis-
cerning main aspects from details of the project.
Execution of the project: Level of independence, planning, organization, handling dead-
lines and setbacks, level of own contribution.
The actual assessment form used by the committee has a more fine-grained list of criteria
for evaluating the work. Not all criteria are equally important. The assessment committee
decides the relative importance of each criterion to arrive at a final grade. The motivation
for the grade is documented in an assessment report, see the website.
4.4.4 Checklist
The graduation checklist (Appendix B) summarizes all the steps required starting with get-
ting your study program approved and ending with the graduation ceremony.
4.5 Double degree program DSE and SEC
The qualification to teach computer science to senior secondary school pupils is coupled to
the 3TU master program Science Education and Communication (SEC). This program en-
compasses 120 credits. In Eindhoven it is offered by the Eindhoven School of Education
(ESoE). In the Education track of the SEC program, a student specializes in one of four dis-
ciplines: maths, physics, chemistry or computer science. Please note that the SEC program
is completely lectured in Dutch!
BSc graduates in computer science are directly admitted to the SEC-program. So are MSc
graduates from a computer science oriented program; their SEC-program is reduced to 60
credits because of exemptions. For this last category an even shorter route is available by
taking the double degree program, which amounts up to 150 credits. Enrollment is required
for both master programs (one main enrollment and a second enrollment). Certificates will
be granted after completion of the whole program.
Details about the curriculum are available at the ESoE website: http://www.tue.nl/
esoe/.
It is possible to take 45 credits worth of components of the SEC program within the DSE
master. The TU/e strives to have this become sufficient to obtain a teaching qualification
without doing a double degree DSE and SEC master.

Information Security Technology
A Master of Science in Information Security Technology (IST) is an academic expert in the
area of digital communication in general, and in information security technology in partic-
ular. Information security technology protects data that are stored, transmitted, accessed, or
modified against all kinds of threats. This can vary from unauthorized access to malicious
manipulations. Information security technology is essential for secure communication and
data protection in many situations.
The IST program is a joint master program between the TU/e and the Radboud Uni-
versity (RU). These universities have joined their forces with respect to security educa-
tion. This joint master program is called the “TRU/e Master in Cyber Security” (see http:
//true-security.nl).
Each of the mandatory and special elective courses is taught at only one of these univer-
sities. This implies that students have to travel to other sites for part of their education. The
program is set up in such a way that averaged over the two years of their master’s studies
students will have to travel one day per week to another university.
After taking some courses, you will probably have a more clear picture of the academic
direction you want to pursue in your studies. If not, you may want to talk to several staff
members or the study advisor. In the specialization for your subject, there are people that
you may want to be involved with for your final master project (see Section 5.4). In order
to compose a well-balanced program that provides adequate prerequisites for this project,
it is advisable to first choose and consult a project supervisor in the specialization of your
interest before choosing elective courses. As a rule of thumb, you should start your search
for a supervisor and the construction of your individual program not later than at the end
of your first year.
A Master of Science in Information Security Technology can become involved in crypto-
graphic primitives, security protocols, data storage, communication, or information security
management. Additionally, he or she can act as internal or external consultant, regarding
the security of information systems and networks, or regarding the security policy of an
organization. A Master of Science in Information Security Technology can enter a job in the
following institutions: research laboratories and academic institutes (both for theoretical
and applied work); applied R&D in industry; the financial world; governmental agencies;
43
44 Information Security Technology
consultancy agencies (all with respect to security in the area of information systems and
relevant policymaking).
5.1 Admission
A Bachelor degree in Computer Science obtained at a Dutch university provides direct ad-
mission to the CSE program. Students with a different degree and from foreign universities
have to apply for admission via the admission committee. Dutch HBO graduates have to
take a pre-master program before they can be admitted, see Section 2.4.
The admission procedure is described in Section 1.5, and the requirements are listed in
the Teaching and Examination Regulations (see Appendix A.1).
5.2 Learning outcomes
The goal of the program is to transform Bachelors in Computer Science and Mathematics
into academic experts in the area of digital communication in general and in information
security in particular. Alumni will be able to function as researcher or as system developer
in university or society. They will be well aware of the state-of-the-art in information secu-
rity technology at the master level. They will be able to analyze complex security situations
and to reduce them to solvable problems.

Business Information Systems
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and the Department of Industrial
Engineering and Innovation Sciences play an active role in the development of new, in-
novative and application-oriented technology. The cooperation between the Information
Systems section within Computer Science and the Information Systems section within In-
dustrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences is long established and fruitful. The master
program in Business Information Systems (BIS) at TU/e is illustrative of these cooperative
efforts.
The program rests on a sound theoretical foundation, with emphasis on the design and
application of quality business information systems and technology for information sys-
tems. As a graduate of this program, the student will have developed a scientific attitude
and a model-driven, engineering approach to the field. The student is trained in the use of
formal models allowing for specification analysis. The area of expertise will be the develop-
ment of business information systems from a business perspective. The student will be able
to play a leading role in the development and application of business information systems
in various sections of society (profit and non-profit).
After taking some courses, you will probably have a more clear picture of the academic
direction you want to pursue in your studies. If not, you may want to talk to several staff
members or the study advisor. In the specialization for your subject, there are people that
you may want to be involved with for your final master project (see Section 6.4). In order
to compose a well-balanced program that provides adequate prerequisites for this project,
it is advisable to first choose and consult a project supervisor in the specialization of your
interest before choosing elective courses. As a rule of thumb, you should start your search
for a supervisor and the construction of your individual program not later than at the end
of your first year.
6.1 Admission
A Bachelor degree in Computer Science or in Industrial Engineering obtained at a Dutch
university provides direct admission to the BIS program. Students with a different degree
and from foreign universities have to apply for admission via the admission committee.
49

6.3 Curriculum 2015
The Master program Business Information Systems is a two-year program of 120 ECTS in
total. The academic year is subdivided into two semesters, the fall semester starting in
September, and the spring semester starting in February. It is possible to enter the program
in either semester; however, starting in September is preferred. The program is full time.
The BIS curriculum is structured in streams, which provide an organized set of courses
in particular subject areas within computer science and industrial engineering. The streams
provide guidance for the directions in which you can specialize, and ensure that you choose
a comprehensive and coherent set of courses. When you enroll to the BIS master you should
choose a stream right away because this determines the list of stream electives and the as-
signment of a mentor. The streams are:
 Logistics
 Information management
Business Information Systems 51
 Business process intelligence
Each stream has the same structure, as summarized in the following table.
Units ECTS
Mandatory courses 30
Stream electives 20
Free electives 40
Master project 30
The above table shows that there is great flexibility in defining your individual study pro-
gram fas there are 35 credits in free electives. Within this part you should include 15 credit
points in international experience if you do not yet have that and are not doing your master
project abroad. To prepare for the master project, you take a seminar course from one of the
computer science research groups. In the following sections, more details for each of the
streams are given.
6.3.1 Core and stream program
The mandatory courses for the BIS master are as follows.
Quarter Code Unit ECTS Exam
1 1BM10 Electronic business 5 a+o
2 1BM05 Business process management 5 w+a
2 1BM41 Business information systems architecture 5 w+a
3 2IMI30 Business process simulation 5 a
3 2IMI10 Business process management systems 5 w+a
4 2IMW20 Database technology 5 w+a
Streams distinguish various profiles within the BIS program. In principle, one of the follow-
ing stream packages has to be chosen as part of the program.
Logistics. The logistics stream is aimed at students interested in logistical systems, not
only from an managerial, but also from a mathematical point of view. Topics that are ad-
dressed are accounting and finance, supply chain management, constraint-based optimiza-
tion and distributed systems. The goal of this stream is for students not only to understand
the complexity of logistical systems, but also to be able to develop solution architectures for
supporting logistical systems while focusing on optimality of the provided solutions.
Information Management. The focus of the information management stream is on the
managerial side of information technology. Emphasis is placed on how people interact with
software, how software should be managed and how innovative organizations should be
organized. Furthermore, the students are trained in writing a business plan and maintaining
a business network.
Business Process Intelligence. The business process intelligence stream aims at the more
technical side of business information systems. The focus of this stream is on the analysis of
52 Business Information Systems
models and other sources of information such as event logs, using techniques and insights
from metamodelling, process mining, visualization, and business intelligence.
The stream courses can be found in the table below.

6.3.2 Electives
This section provides a list of courses that are generally recommended for the free electives
space in the curriculum. The list applies to all streams. In addition to the courses from this
list we also recommend the stream courses from the other streams, listed in the previous
section. In principle all master courses offered at the TU/e can be chosen as free electives so
you are not restricted to the lists given for the BIS master. We suggest you at least have a look
at all master courses offered by the Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science and
of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Science.
Your complete study program including the free electives always requires approval by
the examinations committee. Your mentor will help you to compose a balanced program
that is very likely to be approved.
Some courses may be prescribed as homologation courses (up to 15 credits) to make up
for deficiencies in former education. This prescription is part of the admission decision.
If you do not (yet) have a degree from another country or at least 15 credit points in
international experience you should reserve 15 credits from the room for free electives to
take courses abroad or to do an internship of 15 credits abroad, see Section 1.8. (This does
not apply to students taking the teacher training.)

1 This literature study can only be followed by students that will perform their master project in
the Information Systems group of IE&IS.
2 Capita selecta can only be taken after prior approval by the responsible lecturer.
3 It is a good idea (but not mandatory) to take a seminar (or literature study) in the group where you
are going to do your master thesis project. Seminars or the literature study for BIS can be taken from
the fourth quarter of your study program onwards. This means that if you enroll in September, you
cannot take the seminars in quarter 2 in your first year, but that you have to wait until you have
entered the second year. Similarly, if you enroll in February, the seminars in quarter 4 can only be
followed in your second year.
4 The Seminar algorithms is given in quarter 4 only in 2015-2016. After this academic year it moves
to quarter 6 like most other seminars.
54 Business Information Systems
6.3.3 Homologation units
Homologation units are bachelor courses that should be taken to make up for deficiencies
in former education.
Students who have a Dutch university bachelor degree in Computer Science have to include
the following unit as an elective:
Quarter Code Unit ECTS Exam
2 2DI60 Stochastic operations research 5 w
Students who have a Dutch university bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering have to
include the following unit as an elective:
Quarter Code Unit ECTS Exam
1 2IBP90 Programming 5 w+a
Students who have a foreign bachelor degree may be prescribed different courses. This is
done on an individual basis by the Admissions Committee.
6.4 Final project
The knowledge and experience, which were acquired in the first part of the program, are
applied in an individual setting in order to develop to the necessary level to function as
an academic professional in the field of Business Information Systems. The project can be
completed in any of the specializations listed in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, provided that a
staff member of the associated group has the supervision.
Prior to starting the final project you should first choose and consult the intended final
project supervisor. If you are in doubt how to choose the graduation supervisor please
consider contacting your mentor.
The start of your master project is marked by submitting a completed graduation plan
containing the necessary information on the project (name, place, period, supervisor, and
so on), and stating the fact that you have completed your curricular part of the program
(see Section 1.10). The form must be accompanied by a project description and signed by
you, your supervisor, the head of the relevant specialization and the study advisor. Note
that when the master project is carried out under supervision of a staff member from the
Department Math&CS the code is 2IMC00 and when it is done in the Department IE&IS the
code is 1BM91.
6.4.1 Admission
During the master project, you should be able to work and concentrate on your project full-
time. In practice, however, it turns out to be rather difficult to plan all your curricular ac-
tivities and, especially, their success. If all courses have been completed, permission to start
the master project will be granted. If more than two courses or 10 credit points (whichever
is lower) have not been completed, such permission will not be granted. In other cases (no
more than two courses or 10 credit points not yet completed) it depends on the status of the
uncompleted courses whether permission to start the master project will be granted, and if
Business Information Systems 55
so, whether it is feasible to work on the project full time. Courses that are to be taken as ho-
mologation units must be completed and passed before you are allowed to start the master
project. Also, be aware that you are not allowed to finish your project (with presentation
and defense) before you have completed all your courses. For more information, please
contact the study advisor.
6.4.2 Planning
Together with your supervisor, you decide on a description of your topic and a global plan-
ning. You also arrange the supervision method, including how often you and your supervi-
sor will meet to discuss progress. The project is concluded with a thesis and a presentation
followed by a defense.
In general, the master project should be completed within 6 months from the start. An
extension to 9 months is possible. In exceptional cases, and only if it is clear that the project
can be finished, the exam committee may allow for an additional 3 months period. It is
important to note that the project must be finished within 1 year. A project not finished
within 1 year is automatically cancelled and graded as ”fail”. You then have to start a new
project with a different supervisor. The complete graduation regulations can be found on
the website.
6.4.3 Assessment
Your final project is graded by an assessment committee. The Assessment Committee con-
sists of three voting members including the graduation supervisor and the graduation tu-
tor. An assessment committee should contain a voting member from both the Industrial
Engineering & Innovation Sciences department and the Computer Science sub-department
within the Mathematics and Computer Science department. Furthermore, at least one vot-
ing member should be from the Information Systems group of the Mathematics and Com-
puter Science department or from the Information Systems group of the Industrial Engi-
neering & Innovation Sciences department. The supervisor is responsible for forming this
committee at least one month before graduation.
The assessment committee takes the following criteria into account:
Results: Significance of the results versus difficulty of the problem or project
goals.
Report: Structure, completeness, correctness, readability, argumentation.
Graduation presentation: Structure, contents, clarity, contact with audience.
Defense: Argumentation, demonstration of knowledge, competency in dis-
cerning main aspects from details of the project.
Execution of the project: Level of independence, planning, organization, handling dead-
lines and setbacks, level of own contribution.
The actual assessment form used by the committee has a more fine-grained list of criteria
for evaluating the work. Not all criteria are equally important. The assessment committee
decides the relative importance of each criterion to arrive at a final grade. The motivation
for the grade is documented in an assessment report, see the website.

6.4.4 Checklist
The graduation checklist (Appendix B) summarizes all the steps required from having your
study program approved to the graduation ceremony.
6.5 Double degree program BIS and SEC
The qualification to teach computer science to senior secondary pupils is coupled to the
3TU program Science Education and Communication (SEC). This program encompasses
120 credits. In Eindhoven it is offered by the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE). In the
Education track of the SEC program a student specializes in one of four disciplines: maths,
physics, chemistry or computer science. Please note that the SEC program is completely
lectured in Dutch!
BSc graduates in computer science are directly admitted to the SEC-program. So are
MSc graduates from a computer science oriented program like BIS; their SEC-program is
reduced to 60 credits because of exemptions. For this last category an even shorter route
is available by taking the double degree program, which amounts up to 150 ects. In the
BIS-part of the program the stream is replaced by SEC subjects. Enrollment is required for
both master programs (one main enrollment and a second enrollment). Certificates will be
granted after completion of the whole program.
Details about the curriculum are available at the ESoE website: http://www.tue.nl/
esoe/.
It is possible to take 45 credits worth of components of the SEC program within the BIS
master. The TU/e strives to have this become sufficient to obtain a teaching qualification
without doing a double degree BIS and SEC master.

Embedded Systems
The design of innovative software and hardware is the core of technological and industrial
progress. Both the departments of Mathematics and Computer Science and Electrical Engi-
neering play an active role in the development of new, innovative technology. The Master of
Science program in Embedded Systems at the TU/e is illustrative of this active role, as it is a
co-production of these two departments, awaiting students with a background in computer
science, as well as graduates from the field of electrical engineering.
The program rests on a sound theoretical foundation, with an emphasis on the design
of quality embedded systems. As a graduate of this program, you will have developed
a scientific attitude and an engineering approach to the field. Your position will be the
design of embedded systems from a high-level architecture viewpoint, via requirements
and behavioral specifications and using platforms, hardware and silicon. You will be able
to play a leading role in the development of embedded systems, either in scientific research,
in industry or governmental organizations.
After taking some courses, you will probably have a more clear picture of the academic
direction you want to pursue in your studies. If not, you may want to talk to several staff
members or the study advisor. In the specialization for your subject, there are people that
you may want to be involved with for your final master project (see Section 7.4). In order
to compose a well-balanced program that provides adequate prerequisites for this project,
it is advisable to first choose and consult a project supervisor in the specialization of your
interest before choosing elective courses. As a rule of thumb, you should start your search
for a supervisor and the construction of your individual program not later than at the end
of your first year.
The Embedded Systems program focuses on the design of efficient and reliable systems.
In order to be able to compose dependable protocols for the behavior of such systems, you
need knowledge of algorithms, performance, hardware, methods of design and documen-
tation, and an insight into the variability and maintainability of these protocols. All these
aspects are addressed in the compulsory part of the program.
The masters degree program in Embedded Systems is a joint program of the 3TU fed-
eration. The programs offered at each location share the common core part (25 credits).
Furthermore, some specialisation courses are exchanged by 3TU telefacilities.

7.1 Admission
A Bachelor degree in Computer Science or in Electrical Engineering obtained at a Dutch
university provides direct admission to the ES program. Students with a different degree
and from foreign universities have to apply for admission via the admission committee.
Dutch HBO graduates have to take a pre-master program before they can be admitted, see
Section 2.5.
The admission procedure is described in Section 1.5, and the requirements are listed in
the Teaching and Examination Regulations (see Appendix A.3).

7.3 Curriculum 2015
The Master program Embedded Systems is a two-year program of 120 ECTS in total. The
academic year is subdivided into two semesters, the fall semester starting in September, and
the spring semester starting in February. It is possible to enter the program at the start of
either semester; however, starting in September is preferred. The program is only offered as
a full time study program.
The curriculum consists of courses offered by the Computer Science division of the de-
partment Mathematics and Computer Science and the department of Electrical Engineering
This section describes the curriculum at the TU/e; the programs of the two partner univer-
sities can be found in the program guides of the TUDelft and the University of Twente.
Embedded Systems 59
The ES curriculum is structured in streams, which provide an organized set of courses in
particular subject areas within Embedded Systems. The purpose of streams is, on the one
hand, to provide guidance to students in composing coherent individual study programs,
and on the other hand, to preserve the multidisciplinary nature of each individual ES study
program.
When you enroll to the ES master you should choose a stream right away because this
determines the list of stream courses and the assignment of a mentor. The streams are:
 Systems on Chip
 Embedded Software
 Embedded Networking
 Cyber-Physical Systems
Each stream has the same structure, as summarized in the following table.
Units ECTS
Mandatory courses 25
Stream courses 15
Stream electives 20
Free electives 20
Master thesis preparation 10
Master project 30
Each stream has a three mandatory courses, and a selected set of elective courses from which
at least 20 credit points should be chosen. The remaining part of your individual study pro-
gram can be used for free electives, i.e., courses taken from any master program offered
at the TU/e. We give some recommendations in Section 7.3.6. In addition you may also
choose courses from the ES programs in Delft or Twente, provided that there is no content-
wise overlap with other courses in your individual study program. You need to obtain
permission from the study advisor before enrolling in courses from Delft or Twente to con-
firm there is no overlap issue. Within your study program you should include 15 credit
points in international experience if you do not yet have that and are not doing your master
project abroad. To prepare for the master project, you start with a master thesis preparation
in quarters 5 and 6, followed by the master project in quarters 7 and 8. In the following
sections, more details for each of the streams are given.

7.3.2 Systems on Chip stream
Modern chips are rapidly evolving into complete systems on chip (SoCs). Heterogeneous
SoCs with one or more general-purpose embedded processors (e.g., ARM cores), dedicated
accelerators, reconfigurable fabric, and advanced memory and interconnect structures are
typically used in devices where energy efficiency and performance are both important. Ho-
mogeneous SoCs are characterized by replication of regular structures, leading to multi-
and many-core architectures that target high-performance computing. The emergence of
SoCs leads to new challenges in VLSI design, design automation, programming and code
generation, task and communication mapping and scheduling, memory management, and
model-driven design-space exploration.

7.3.3 Embedded Software stream
The behaviour and functionality of embedded systems is largely determined by the software
that it runs. This software must be of excellent quality because embedded systems must of-
ten perform safety critical tasks without human supervision for long periods of time with
guaranteed performance. Parallelism (in tasks, data and instructions), distribution, and re-
activity pose additional challenges. As the software generally outlives the hardware, the
software must be such that it is easily maintainable and adaptable to always changing cir-
cumstances. Model-driven design, formal proof and advanced code generation techniques
are very important to achieve this.

7.3.4 Embedded Networking stream
Embedded Networking (EN) refers to the powerful trend of the last twenty years of connect-
ing embedded systems into networks. For electronic systems in automotive, for example,
the network is often the point of integration. More recently we have seen the concept of the
Internet of Things, the vision that everyday objects get enriched with embedded electron-
ics, that these objects are uniquely identified and communicate using a unified protocol and
naming scheme (indeed, the Internet protocols). EN includes the fields of sensor networks,
but also networked systems that represent a platform and are not identical to the applica-
tion. From the sensor network domain, concerns of effective resource management (like
size, energy, memory, communication bandwidth) are derived. Quality metrics for EN in-
clude performance (latency, throughput), dependability (quality of service) and scalability.
Besides these, EN challenges lie in the architecture of system and software, in management
and sharing of distributed resources, in interoperability and semantics, in security and pri-
vacy, and in application development. While it is fairly easy to sketch advanced applica-
tions, it is not straightforward to realize these in a cost-effective manner. Relevant topics for
this stream are: distributed systems (architecture and protocols), networked systems, data
semantics, network security, system correctness, and resource management.

7.3.5 Cyber-Physical Systems stream
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by a tight coupling between embedded
computer (cyber) systems and physical processes, monitored and controlled by those com-
puter systems. Next generation embedded systems in automotive, professional printing,
electron microscopy, semiconductor lithography, and medical imaging, are rapidly evolving
into CPS. CPS require integral, multidisciplinary design, involving computer engineering,
control, mechatronics, networking, signal processing, and mathematical modeling. Embedded-
system design needs to take into account constraints and requirements from other domains;
cross-domain design paradigms are needed to optimize the embedded system in combina-
tion with the monitored and controlled system.

7.3.6 Free Electives
In principle all master courses offered at the TU/e can be chosen as free electives. Also
courses from the Embedded Systems programs in TU Delft and the University of Twente
may qualify as suitable free electives. Your complete study program including the free
electives always requires approval by the examinations committee. Your mentor will help
you to compose a balanced program that is very likely to be approved.
Some courses may be prescribed as homologation courses (up to 10 credits) to make
up for deficiencies in former education (see Section 7.3.7). This prescription is part of the
admission decision.
If you do not (yet) have a degree from another country or at least 15 credit points in
international experience you should reserve 15 credits from the room for free electives to
take courses abroad or to do an internship of 15 credits abroad, see Section 1.8.
7.3.7 Homologation units
Students entering Embedded Systems program have very diverse backgrounds. When you
are admitted to the program, or directly at the start of the program, it will be evaluated
to what extent you satisfy the BSc-level knowledge and skills required for the Embedded
Systems master program in general, and the stream of your choice in particular. Deficiencies
should be repaired by taking one or more homologation modules. Homologation packages
may consist of one or more homologation modules and may comprise at most 10 EC in
total. The credits obtained for homologation modules will count as free electives in your
study program. We may prescribe homologation modules, depending on your background
knowledge and skills and the stream of your choice.
We will offer the homologation modules below. You will generally be expected to do the
homologation modules by self-study, with some guidance by a responsible lecturer. In most
cases, the homologation modules are associated with existing BSc-level courses, so that you
can attend lectures, tutorials and lab sessions if needed.

If you feel that you lack knowledge and skills not addressed by one of the homologation
modules above, then contact the study advisor.
7.3.8 Seminars, Internship and multi-disciplinary design project
Since the master project can already be performed in an industrial environment, it is usually
advised to spend the rest of the study program on regular courses. In some cases, however,
an internship (code 2IMC10 or 5L990) may be a valuable addition to the program, provided
that it enhances practical experience, provides deepening of knowledge, contributes to the
specialization, and perhaps provides international experience. See Section 1.8 for details
on internships. Instead of an internship, a multi-disciplinary design project (code 2IW70
or 5KK05) can be performed, in which students work in groups of 2 to 3 on an embedded
design under the supervision of a member of staff. We refer to the course page for more
information. Note that it is not possible to do both an internship and the multi-disciplinary
design project.
The Computer Science division of the department Mathematics and Computer Science
offers seminars and ”capita selecta” that may help you prepare for your master project by
studying topics not covered by regular courses. The table below lists the possibilities and
codes for seminars, capita selecta, internship and multi-disciplinary design project.

7.4 Final project
Prior to starting the final project you should first choose and consult the intended final
project supervisor. The project can be completed in any of the specializations listed in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.3, provided that a staff member of the associated group has the
supervision. In case the project is carried out under supervision of a staff member of the
Mathematics and Computer Science department, the course code is 2IMC00. In case the
supervisor is from the Electrical Engineering department, the code is 5T746. If you are in
doubt how to choose the graduation supervisor please consider contacting your mentor.
The start of your master project is marked by submitting a completed graduation plan
containing the necessary information on the project (name, place, period, supervisor, and so
on), and stating the fact that you obtained approval of your study program (see Section 1.10)
and that you fulfill all requirements listed in Section 7.4.1. The form must be accompanied
by a project description and signed by you, your supervisor, the head of the relevant spe-
cialization, and the study advisor.
7.4.1 Admission
During the master project, you should be able to work and concentrate on your project full-
time. In practice, however, it turns out to be rather difficult to plan all your curricular ac-
tivities and, especially, their success. If all courses have been completed, permission to start
the master project will be granted. If more than two courses or 10 credit points (whichever
is lower) have not been completed, such permission will not be granted. In other cases (no
more than two courses or 10 credit points not yet completed) it depends on the status of the
uncompleted courses whether permission to start the master project will be granted, and
if so, whether it is feasible to work on the project full time. Courses that are to be taken
as homologation units must be completed and passed before you are allowed to start the
master project. Note that the preparation for graduation ES project (2IMC05 or 5T514) must be
finished and graded before you can start the master project. Also, be aware that you are not
allowed to finish your project (with presentation and defense) before you have completed
all your courses. For more information, please contact the study advisor.
66 Embedded Systems
7.4.2 Planning
Together with your supervisor, you decide on a description of your topic and a global plan-
ning. You also arrange the supervision method, including how often you and your supervi-
sor will meet to discuss progress. The project is concluded with a thesis and a presentation
followed by a defense.
In general, the master project should be completed within 6 months from the start. An
extension to 9 months is possible. In exceptional cases, and only if it is clear that the project
can be finished, the exam committee may allow for an additional 3 months period. It is
important to note that the project must be finished within 1 year. A project not finished
within 1 year is automatically cancelled and graded as ”fail”. You then have to start a new
project with a different supervisor. The complete graduation regulations can be found on
the website.
7.4.3 Assessment
Your final project is graded by an assessment committee. The committee usually consists
of your supervisor, a staff member from your specialization area, and a staff member from
one of the other research groups of the division of Computer Science of the department of
Mathematics and Computer Science or of the department of Electrical Engineering. The
supervisor is responsible for forming this committee at least one month before graduation.
The assessment committee takes the following criteria into account:
Results: Significance of the results versus difficulty of the problem or project
goals.
Report: Structure, completeness, correctness, readability, argumentation.
Graduation presentation: Structure, contents, clarity, contact with audience.
Defense: Argumentation, demonstration of knowledge, competency in dis-
cerning main aspects from details of the project.
Execution of the project: Level of independence, planning, organization, handling dead-
lines and setbacks, level of own contribution.
The actual assessment form used by the committee has a more fine-grained list of criteria
for evaluating the work. Not all criteria are equally important. The assessment committee
decides the relative importance of each criterion to arrive at a final grade. The motivation
for the grade is documented in an assessment report, see the website.
7.4.4 Checklist
The graduation checklist (Appendix B) summarizes all the steps required from having your
study program approved to the graduation ceremony.

Research groups
In this chapter, you can read about the different research groups associated with the master
programs. Each group provides a short description of their research area, and mentions
some courses that are relevant for students who wish to participate their research. The
courses are not meant to be obligatory for candidate graduates, but they give an impression
of the predispositions of the staff. The contact person mentioned may give you additional
information on the possibilities of a graduation project in the corresponding group.
8.1 Research groups in the CS department
This section describes the research groups that provide graduation projects for all master
programs, i.e., BIS, CSE, ES, and IST.
8.1.1 Algorithms
Contact person: prof. Mark de Berg
The creation, storage, analysis and manipulation of spatial data plays a central role in
robotics, computer graphics, geographical information systems, and other areas of com-
puter science. In all these areas, there are many challenging algorithmic questions. For
example, a typical problem in robotics is to compute efficient routes for a robot moving
through a factory building while avoiding all obstacles in its way. A typical problem in geo-
graphic information systems could be to find a good location of a new airfield, say the loca-
tion such that the region in a 20-mile radius around it is the least populated. Such problems
form the focus of this specialization: we study techniques and concepts for the design and
analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on algorithms for spatial
data. Typical master projects are either experimental or theoretical in nature, depending on
the interests of the student.

8.1.2 Applied Geometric Algorithms
Contact person: prof. Bettina Speckmann
The research area of geometric algorithms, also called computational geometry, has an ex-
citing variety of application areas which include robotics, databases, computer graphics,
geographic information science (GIScience), information visualization, and molecular biol-
ogy, to name a few. The Applied Geometric Algorithms group focusses in particular on
(applications of) geometric algorithms to spatial data in the areas of GIScience, including
automated cartography and moving object analysis, (geo-)visualization, visual analytics,
and e-humanities.
 (Automated) cartography is focused mostly on the visualization aspects of GIScience
and has established itself as its own research area. In recent years the computational
aspects of thematic mapping have received considerable interest. Maps are effec-
tive tools for communicating information and hence spatial data (and also some non-
spatial data) can be displayed well using maps. Thematic maps often depict a single
theme or attribute, such as population, income, crime rate, or migration. There are
many possibilities for creative projects with both an experimental and a theoretical
competent in the area of automated cartography.
 Over the past years the availability of devices that can be used to track moving ob-
jects — GPS satellite systems, mobile phones, radio telemetry, surveillance cameras,
RFID tags, and more - has increased dramatically, leading to an explosive growth in
movement data. Objects being tracked range from animals (for behavioral studies)
and cars (for traffic prediction), to hurricanes, sports players (for video analysis of
games), and suspected terrorists. Naturally the goal is not only to track objects but
also to extract information from the resulting data. The study of algorithms for the
analysis and visualization of movement data is hence a rapidly expanding research
area at the intersection of computational geometry, geographic information science,
automated cartography, and information visualization. There is a broad spectrum of
possible projects in this area, ranging from very fundamental and theoretical to purely
experimental, with (nearly) any combination possible.
 The increased digitization of cultural heritage artifacts such as books, manuscripts, or
musical scores, creates an ever growing set of highly complex data which humanities
researchers aim to analyze and understand. The fields of information visualization
and visual analytics develop computer-supported, interactive, visual representations
Research groups 69
which allow users to extract meaning from large and heterogeneous data sets. While
such visual techniques have become common practice in the sciences, they are little
employed by researchers in the humanities, despite similar increases in available data.
The area of e-humanities, which deals with the development and use of digital tech-
nologies in the humanities and social sciences, is hence an beautiful application area
for algorithmic visualization with a potentially high impact on society. Here there are
again many possibilities for projects which combine an experimental and a theoretical
component. In addition, collaboration with humanities researchers is often a (desired)
possibility.

8.1.3 Architecture of Information Systems
Contact person: dr. Natalia Sidorova
The Architecture of Information Systems (AIS) research group investigates methods, tech-
niques and tools for the design and analysis of Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS),
i.e., systems that support business processes (workflows) inside and between organizations.
AIS is not only interested in these information systems and their architecture, but also model
and analyze the business processes and organizations they support. The group aims at re-
sults that are highly original and applicable in real-life situations. The main three research
lines of AIS are:
 Process Modeling and Analysis. Models are commonly used to answer questions re-
lated to correctness and performance. One of the main goals here is to further improve
verification techniques to check various properties such as soundness, data/resource
soundness, accordance, controllability, and selected temporal properties. Pattern-based
approaches are used for correctness-by-design. Another goal is to develop innovative
simulation approaches that better reflect reality and that can be used in an operational
setting while using process mining results.
 Process Mining. Process mining techniques are used to extract process-related infor-
mation from event logs, e.g., to automatically discover models, check conformance,
and augment existing models with additional insights extracted from some event log.
The goals are to significantly improve the state-of-the-art in process discovery, to ad-
vance the state-of-the-art in conformance checking, and to predict problems, i.e., pro-
vide warnings based on historic information (e.g., a case will be late or an error is
likely to occur).
70 Research groups
 PAIS Technology. PAISs are used to manage and execute operational processes involv-
ing people, applications, and/or information sources. Examples are WFM (Workflow
Management), BPM (Business Process Management), and ERP (Enterprise Resource
Planning) systems. Increasingly, these systems are driven by models and produce
high-quality event logs. We are interested in the artifacts used and produced by these
systems (i.e., models and logs) as these are essential for testing the techniques devel-
oped in the two other research lines. For example, it is interesting to convert and ver-
ify process models expressed in some particular industry language. The same holds
of course for event logs. Service-orientation plays an important role here and this new
architectural style poses new research questions.

8.1.4 Formal System Analysis
Contact person: prof. Jan Friso Groote
The focus of the specialization FSA is on modeling and verifying behavior of systems and
programs. Behavior must be understood as all possible actions that a system can consecu-
tively perform during its lifetime.
Computer-based systems are so complex, that it is impossible to program them with-
out understanding how the different software components communicate, and what the re-
sponsibilities of these parts are. By modeling the behavior, these responsibilities are made
explicit. Due to the complexity of the matter at hand, it is also non-trivial to get these behav-
ioral models correct. For this purpose we use analysis techniques. Primarily, these are used
to find flaws in the model, and ultimately these are employed to show that the modeled
behavior satisfies all the requirements. For instance, a data communication protocol must
not lose messages, and a firewall should under no circumstance let an intruder pass. With
current modeling techniques it is no problem to model the communication patterns of even
the most complex systems. Using modal formulas most requirements can be formulated in
a formal, precise way. Using one of the many existing process equivalences, it is very well
possible to state the behavioral equivalence between implementations and specifications.
So, in general, it is not really problematic (but sometimes hard) to formulate the properties
that a system ought to have.
The current technological bottleneck is our capability to prove that a requirement holds
for a given model (the model checking problem) or that two processes are actually equiv-
alent (the equivalence checking problem). The major research activity of this group is to
increase the strength of the analysis tools. The core problem of the analysis of behavior is
Research groups 71
the state space explosion problem. There are so many states in which a system can end up,
that it is generally impossible to explore these all individually. For this purpose, we must
use so-called symbolic techniques to enable the verification. These techniques come from
the realm of automatic reasoning, term rewriting and computer assisted theorem checking.
Also, state space reduction techniques (abstract interpretation, confluence checking) are rel-
evant to reduce the problem size. Visualization turns out to be a relevant tool, to detect
unforeseen problems and to increase insight in the behavior. Knowledge of algorithms, in-
cluding I/O-efficient algorithms is relevant, to construct analysis tools capable of dealing
with huge state spaces.
In order to investigate how effective our analysis techniques are, we are constantly as-
sessing their practical use. For instance, the FSA group is involved in the standardization
of several protocol standards (e.g. firewire). Our role is to assist the standardization pro-
cess by showing where the protocol does not conform to its intention. With several of the
embedded system industries around Eindhoven, we have a similar relationship: we design,
model and analyze (parts of) the behavior of the equipment they are building.

8.1.5 System Architecture and Networking
Contact person: dr. Rudolf Mak
Imagine just any electronic system that is not somehow networked with other systems.
Found one? Must be a pretty boring system then, since one of the fascinating developments
of the last years is that devices of all form factors and functionality become connected. In
our group we study parallel and distributed systems with an emphasis on pervasive sys-
tems or, as we call it, Resource Constrained Networked Embedded Systems.

Master thesis assignments are related to the research topics of SAN, which focus on
distributed aspects of RCNES (middleware and networked services), on the platform (pre-
dictable and reliable resource management) and on efficient embedded computations (typ-
ical for signal processing). Research questions are, for example, how to build and manage
applications composed from distributed services, and how to perform distributed resource
management.
We pay a lot of attention to quality aspects, which include performance, predictability,
dependability, programmability and security. A dominant issue in our work is therefore
the architecture of these RCNES, in particular the software architecture, as this is where the
quality aspects are addressed. We relate our work to application domains which we see as
vehicles for our research. Example application domains include distributed media systems,
wireless sensor networks, automotive electronics and, more recently, lighting. Much of
this work is done in cooperation with industry through national and international projects.
Have a look at our research page to see the projects we are involved in.
8.1.6 Security
Contact person: prof. Sandro Etalle
The interconnectivity and pervasiveness of computers and of embedded systems like PDAs
and smart phones is not only determining new functionalities, but is also opening the way
to increasingly sophisticated attacks. Indeed, in the last years the field of security has be-
come one of the main focuses of computer science research around the globe. The recently
established security group aims at contributing to a comprehensive framework for the engi-
neering, the deployment and the maintenance of secure distributed systems, in which exist-
ing and new techniques are harmonized and integrated. The group focuses on distributed
system security: a broad area that deals with the security of embedded systems as well as
of the ICT infrastructures. Prominent subfields are: the specification and the enforcement
of usage policies of critical systems, verification of security protocols, trust management.
The group cooperates actively with the Radboud University in the TRU/e cyber security
master.

8.1.7 Software Engineering and Technology
Contact person: prof. Mark van den Brand
Software has become one of the key enablers of modern society. In almost all activities that
we do as human beings software plays a role, whether this is social media, buying goods,
monitoring our sports activities, or in the production of goods.
The high-tech industry, in particular, is facing two trends. First of all, the amount of
software is growing rapidly. Secondly, the quality of software is decreasing. These trends
result in new research challenges. How to develop more high quality software in less time?
How to guarantee the quality of the software? How to deal with the huge amount of existing
software? The answers to these questions are not straightforward. A common theme in the
answer to these questions is model driven software engineering. Models provide a higher
level of abstraction and thus allow the specification of more functionality in less code. The
models can also be used as starting point for simulation and verification. Finally, existing
software can be analysed and the underlying models can be extracted. The research focus of
the research group SET is on model based software development and on software evolution.
The field of model based software development is broad. We concentrate on the de-
velopment of tooling to support the development of models in domain specific formalisms
using meta-modeling techniques. Research on tooling for model based software develop-
ment includes the modularity of meta-models, the description of semantics of domain spe-
cific languages, the verification of model transformation formalisms, and the co-evolution
of models and meta-models. The ultimate goal is to provide a tool set which provides high
fidelity software generation.
As the process software evolution encompasses the entire life cycle of a software sys-
tem, from inception to phase out. As research domain software evolution aims at obtaining
insights in how and why does software evolve as well as at translating those insights into
techniques for assessing system evolvability and facilitating evolution. Given the fact that
software evolution is an activity carried by humans, on top of technological challenges soft-
ware evolution research also considers social and socio-technical ones. Lion’s share of the
software evolution research is empirical in nature, i.e., it requires combination of software
development skills with data analysis skills.

8.1.8 Visualization
Contact person: dr. Huub van de Wetering
Data visualization aims to provide insight in large data sets by using interactive graph-
ics, exploiting the unique capabilities of the human visual system to detect patterns and
structures. By presenting data visually, people can see unexpected relations; by offering
interaction they are enabled to explore huge data sets, driven by their interest.
The focus of this specialization is on the development of new methods and techniques
for interactive visualization. The main fields of interest are information visualization and vi-
sual analytics, both aiming at insight in abstract data, such as tree structures, networks, and
multivariate data, for applications in areas as software engineering, bioinformatics, health
care, security, and traffic analysis. Our aims are to develop new visual representations and
interaction methods, and to evaluate these on real world use cases to verify if they are ef-
fective. Some typical challenges are dealing with combinations of different data types, inte-
gration of methods from machine learning, handling dynamic data, and understanding the
needs and wants of users. Another interest is in high performance scientific computing: ex-
ploiting the power of GPUs for visualization and computer graphics, with physically based
animation and 3D shape analysis as typical applications.
Furthermore, in cooperation with the Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica (CWI)
virtual reality systems are studied. Typical topics include the design and evaluation of 3D
interactive techniques, and methods for improving image quality in virtual reality displays.
Relevant courses for the VIS specialization are:

8.1.9 Web engineering
Contact person: prof. Paul De Bra
The focus of WE is on the study of concepts and technologies that are used to store, access,
manage and retrieve information. Information often comes from several sources that each
Research groups 75
contain a wealth of information of which only a small subset is of interest to any particular
user or user group.
 Database systems are needed to store, maintain, and efficiently query the data; data
can come in different flavors from unstructured text-data, semi-structured XML data
to structured databases;
 Datamining and information retrieval automate the extraction of information and
knowledge from large amounts of data; often so much data is collected that man-
ual analysis is no longer possible. Data mining and information retrieval assist data
analysts in locating relevant information and patterns in the data.
 Adaptation, or automatic personalization, must ensure that each user is guided (auto-
matically) to the information that is relevant to him or her, resulting in Adaptive Hy-
permedia systems. Adaptive Hypermedia is studied at the conceptual and the prac-
tical level: the former is done through the study of Adaptive Hypermedia Reference
Models, the latter through the development of the “Generic Adaptation Language and
Engine” GALE, a general-purpose web-based adaptive hypermedia system.
The WE group focuses research in these overlapping domains aimed at the efficient disclo-
sure of large data repositories in a user-friendly manner, and on the extraction of knowledge
(and value) from data.

projects associated with that project. Note that the role of service spaces for health and
wellbeing will also be addressed in the course 2IMI15 Metamodeling and Interoperability.
9.2 Embedded Systems
The term embedded system refers to electronic components (which almost invariably in-
clude one or more software programmable parts) of a wide variety of personal and indus-
trial devices, e.g., transportation systems, health-care equipments as well as equipments in
the construction industry. In all these areas, embedded systems confer added value to the
products by either extending the range of the delivered functionalities or by enhancing the
quality of a “traditional” functionality that is rendered to the user.
The graduates of this program will have a holistic view on the specification, design, and
implementation of complex embedded systems, taking issues such as resource-constraints,
budget and development time into account. In addition to the technical skills, the EIT pro-
gram offers insights on the elements of business and developing innovations into successful
business ideas.
A distinctive feature of the program is that you study at two universities in two different
institutions and in two different countries: you spend one year at the entry node taking the
common base courses and part of your innovation and entrepreneurship module and then
you move to the exit node for your specialization courses and your graduation project as
well as the rest of the innovation and entrepreneurship module.
