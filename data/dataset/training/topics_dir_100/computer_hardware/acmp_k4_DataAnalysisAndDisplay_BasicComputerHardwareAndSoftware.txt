Overview:
This lesson is an introduction to basic computer hardware and software. If pos-
sible, have one or more types of computers available to show students the 
hardware components found on different computer models. A multimedia pro-
jector can be used to show students the different types of software described in 
the lesson.  
Depending on the time available and grade level, extensions to this lesson could include asking stu-
dents to research how computers are used in various occupations or the history of computers.
Objectives:
The student will:
•	 identify	basic	computer	hardware;	and
•	 describe	uses	of	commonly	used	software.
AK Content Standards:
Technology
A1 A student should be able to operate technology-based tools. A student who meets the content 
standard should use a computer to enter and retrieve information.
Materials:
•	 Several	different	types	of	computers	(optional)
•	 Multimedia	projector	connected	to	a	computer	with	Microsoft	Office,	Photoshop	and	a	Web	
browser	(optional)
•	 STUDENT	WORKSHEET:	“Computer	Hardware	and	Software”
IT Basics
Computers are versatile machines used for processing and manipulating information. They can be 
used to view and edit photos, analyze and graph data, write reports, share information, utilize the In-
ternet and much more. At the heart of the computer is a machine that processes digital data consisting 
of	ones	and	zeros.	The	first	computers	were	made	in	the	1940’s.	They	were	large,	room-sized	objects	
that	were	difficult	to	program.	Today’s	computers	are	much	smaller	and	have	a	wide	variety	of	software	
programs that they can run.

Hardware
The	term	“hardware”	refers	to	the	physical	parts	of	a	computer	system.	The	basic	hardware	of	a	com-
puter system includes:
Case: The box that holds the circuitry for the computer. 
One of the main chips inside is called the central pro-
cessing	unit,	or	CPU	for	short.	This	acts	as	the	“brain”	
to send instructions to other parts of the computer. Al-
though there are other factors to consider, the higher 
the speed of the CPU, the faster the computer can 
send and receive information.
Drives:	 Nearly	 all	 computers	 have	 an	 internal	 hard	
drive used to store information. There are many other 
types of drives, such as external hard drives, CD and 
DVD drives that can be used to store information on 
CDs or DVDs.  
Keyboard: The device used to type and enter information into the computer.  
Mouse: A pointing device used to move the cursor displayed on the monitor. Laptops generally use a 
trackpad or touchpad instead of a mouse to move the cursor.
  
Monitor:	The	screen	that	shows	the	information	for	the	computer;		also	called	a	display.		Newer	com-
puters	have	LCD	(liquid	crystal	display)	monitors	that	are	thinner	than	the	older	monitors.
ACMP ©2006-2008 UAF Geophysical Institute A-3 Basic Computer Hardware and Software
Printer: The printer takes the information displayed on the screen and prints it on paper. The most 
common	types	of	printers	are	ink	jet	(left),	which	are		typically	used	in	homes	and	small	businesses,	
and	laser	printers	(right),	which	are	used	in	schools	and	large	businesses.
   
Activity Procedure
1.	 Distribute	the	STUDENT	WORKSHEET:	“Computer	Hardware	and	Software.”
2. As a class, discuss the material presented in the worksheet. Ask students how they have used 
each piece of hardware and software presented.
3. Ask students if they have used other types of hardware or software.
Extension	Ideas:
Some	software	is	specific	to	science	applications,	such	as	software	that	collects	data	from	temperature	
probes.	Try	searching	for	science	specific	software	on	the	Internet.	Ask	students	to	try	out	different	
types of free science software and write a review of the program.

Grades K-4Software:
Software is a term used to describe a computer program, which 
is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. Software can be split into 
three categories. They are: 
 Programming software. This software is used by computer programmers to 
help write computer code. 
 Operating system software. This software runs the computer. It has the 
instructions for using memory, video cards, keyboards, etc. Two common 
operating	systems	are	Windows	XP	and	Macintosh	OSX.
 Applications software. There are literally thousands of different software 
applications. A brief overview of some of the more common ones includes: 
Microsoft Office – this combination of several programs includes:
Microsoft	Word	–	A	word	processing	program	that	is	used	to	type	such	
things as letters, reports and newsletters.
Microsoft	Excel	–	A	spreadsheet	program	that	can	be	used	to	calculate	
numerical data, store data and make charts.  
Microsoft PowerPoint – A presentation program that is used to make 
slides of information and graphics.
Microsoft	Entourage	–	A	program	that	allows	users	to	communicate	
through email.
Web browsers - These programs allow users to navigate the Internet. 
Some	of	the	more	common	ones	include	Microsoft	Internet	Explorer,	
Netscape	Navigator,	Mozilla	Firefox	and	Apple	Safari.		
Adobe Photoshop - Photoshop is a graphics editing program. The 
program is commonly used to enhance digital photos. It is part of the 
Adobe	Creative	Suite	applications.	Photoshop	Elements	is	a	less	
expensive version that is popular with home users.
