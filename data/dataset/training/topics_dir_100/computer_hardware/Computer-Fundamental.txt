Computer Fundamentals 
 
What is Computer? 
Computer is an advanced electronic device that takes raw data as input from the user and 
processes these data under the control of set of instructions (called program) and gives 
the result (output) and saves output for the future use. It can process both numerical and 
non-numerical (arithmetic and logical) calculations. 
A computer has four functions: 
a. accepts data  Input 
b. processes data Processing  
c. produces output  Output  
d. stores results Storage 
 
Input (Data): 
Input is the raw information entered into a computer from the input devices. It is the 
collection of letters, numbers, images etc.  
 
Process: 
Process is the operation of data as per given instruction. It is totally internal process of 
the computer system. 
 
Output: 
Output is the processed data given by computer after data processing. Output is also 
called as Result. We can save these results in the storage devices for the future use.  
 
Computer System 
All of the components of a computer system can be summarized with the simple 
equations. 
 
COMPUTER SYSTEM = HARDWARE + SOFTWARE+ USER 
 
• Hardware = Internal Devices + Peripheral Devices 
All physical parts of the computer (or everything that we can touch) are known as 
Hardware.  
 
• Software = Programs 
Software gives "intelligence" to the computer. 
 
• USER = Person, who operates computer.

Types of Computer 
On the basis of working principle 
a) Analog Computer 
An analog computer (spelt analogue in British English) is a form of computer that uses 
continuous physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to 
model the problem being solved.

On the basis of Size 
a) Super Computer  
The fastest type of computer. Supercomputers are very expensive and are employed for 
specialized applications that require immense amounts of mathematical calculations. For 
example, weather forecasting requires a supercomputer. Other uses of supercomputers 
include animated graphics, fluid dynamic calculations, nuclear energy research, and 
petroleum exploration.  
The chief difference between a supercomputer and a mainframe is that a supercomputer 
channels all its power into executing a few programs as fast as possible, whereas a 
mainframe uses its power to execute many programs concurrently.  
 
 
 
b) Mainframe Computer 
A very large and expensive computer capable of supporting hundreds, or even 
thousands, of users simultaneously. In the hierarchy that starts with a simple 
microprocessor (in watches, for example) at the bottom and moves to supercomputers at 
the top, mainframes are just below supercomputers. In some ways, mainframes are more 
powerful than supercomputers because they support more simultaneous programs. But 
supercomputers can execute a single program faster than a mainframe. 
 
 
c) Mini Computer 
A midsized computer. In size and power, minicomputers lie between workstations and 
mainframes. In the past decade, the distinction between large minicomputers and small 
mainframes has blurred, however, as has the distinction between small minicomputers 
and workstations. But in general, a minicomputer is a multiprocessing system capable of 
supporting from 4 to about 200 users simultaneously.

d) Micro Computer 
i. Desktop Computer: a personal or micro-mini computer sufficient to fit on a 
desk. 
 
ii. Laptop Computer: a portable computer complete with an integrated screen 
and keyboard. It is generally smaller in size than a desktop computer and larger 
than a notebook computer.  
 
iii. Palmtop Computer/Digital Diary /Notebook /PDAs: a hand-sized 
computer. Palmtops have no keyboard but the screen serves both as an input 
and output device.

e) Workstations 
A terminal or desktop computer in a network. In this context, workstation is just a 
generic term for a user's machine (client machine) in contrast to a "server" or 
"mainframe." 
 
 
On the basis of Brand 
a) IBM/IBM Compatible Computers 
  
c) Apple/Macintosh 
  
Booting 
The process of loading the system files of the operating system from the disk into the 
computer memory to complete the circuitry requirement of the computer system is called 
booting. The system files of MS. DOS are: 
 
Types of Booting: 
There are two types of booting: 
• Cold Booting:  If the computer is in off state and we boot the 
computer by pressing the power switch ‘ON’ from the CPU box 
then it is called as cold booting.

• Warm Booting: If the computer is already ‘ON’ and we restart it by pressing 
the ‘RESET’ button from the CPU box or CTRL, ALT and DEL key 
simultaneously from the keyboard then it is called warm booting.  
 
   
How to start the Computer in Ms. Windows mode? 
There is nothing special you need to start this system. Just, 
1. Switch ON the Power Supply. 
2. Switch ON the CPU and, 
3. Switch ON the Screen (Monitor). 
 
How to Shutdown (Turn Off) the Computer? 
Before shutting down the Computer, close all opened windows at first. Then, 
1. Click on Start button. 
2. Click on Shutdown (Turn Off Computer). 
Then, Computer asks you: 
What do you want the Computer to do? 
• Standby 
• Shutdown (Turn Off) 
• Restart  
• Restart in MS-DOS mode. 
 
  
 
Note: The options will be different from one OS to another. 
 
3. Choose 2nd option (i.e. Shutdown/Turn Off). 
4. Click on OK. 
Then, wait until the message “It’s now safe to turn off your Computer”. 
5. Then, Switch Off the screen. 
6. Switch Off the CPU. 
7. At last, Switch Off the power supply.
