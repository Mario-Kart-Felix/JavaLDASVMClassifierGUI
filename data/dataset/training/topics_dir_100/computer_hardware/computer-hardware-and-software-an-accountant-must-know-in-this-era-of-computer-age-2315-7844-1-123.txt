Abstract 
 
The software and hardware components of a computer complement each other. The study looked into computer 
hardware and software skills an accountant must know in this era of technological influx. The population consisted 
of 35 respondents comprising accounting education lecturers in universities in Ekiti State. No sample was made. 
The questionnaire was the main instrument used for data collection. A survey research design was used for this 
study. The data generated were analysed using mean scores and standard deviation. The study revealed that all the 
hardware skills and some were experts of software skills were expected and utilized by accountants in modern 
business organizations located at Ado-Ekiti. Though some aspects of software skills were neither expected nor 
utilized by accountants in discharge their duties in business organizations in Ado-Ekiti. It was recommended that 
computer hardware and software made part of curriculum for training accounting students in Nigeria.

Introduction 
 
Computer as an aspect of information technology is the order of the day; hence it serves as 
the moving train of the society in the labour market. According to Idih (2003), advancement in 
technology has resulted in a lot of emphasis being placed on computer and its related functions. 
New ways of performing office has emerged with new technologies/computer related 
duties. Accountants of today need to be equipped with flexible skills that would enable them 
function effectively in their career and even advance in it. Ideh (2003) further affirms that there 
has to be certain new officially accepted components of the business curriculum that must be 
maintained in all tertiary institutions offering computer related studies. The implication of this 
assertion to business courses is that if these students were not properly exposed to ICT tools 
definitely their performance must be affected in the labour market. Oguoma (2003) attests that 
the absence of a curriculum on computer studies is affecting business organizations. 
 The experience today is that employers resort to training of staff to enable them be 
relevant to their purposes and functions effectively. In this case, the accountants who are not 
versed in the language of computer are not likely to take advantage of the opportunities present 
by 21st century. 
90 
 
Presently, most of ourschools and teachers lack the language of computer and there is no 
hope of having credible computers and computer programmes in our schools. Computer schools 
and departments are just shadows of themselves (Oguoma, 2003). Even where there exist 
computers, it is put to limited use. With these conditions, how would accounting studies 
graduates (accountants) perform accounting jobs authoritatively using computer hardware and 
software applications in the labour market. Hence, they were introduced to only fewer aspects of 
computer applications in discharging their duties. This is why many organizations and their 
accountants are only sufficiently educated about computer appreciations such as Microsoft word, 
word processing, power point, etc, while critical operational information such as computer 
hardware and software cannot be digitalized and shared. 
In most Nigerian offices, computers are not being used for hardware and software 
programmes. Thus, even where there are few computers, they are used for other purposes such as 
typing of letters, memos, reports etc. instead of using software such as accounting package and 
hardware installations. According to Umerah (2010), computer is applied almost in all aspects of 
life including banking system, education, medical services, advanced productivity, research, 
military and revenue allocation. To Ohakwe (2000), Computer can be used to control stock, 
inventory analysis, recording accounting information like sales, purchases, payroll accounting 
etc.Scientific process as seismic interpretations assorted design, and engineering complex 
designs. Computers are essential for their better service, efficient safety, greater efficiency and 
quick retrieval of information. Stating the benefits accruable from acquisition of computer skills 
and competencies, Nwogwugwu (2001) outlined the benefits thus; 
 Computer ensures accuracy and efficiency 
 Reduces drudgery 
 Reduces the length of time required to do work  
 Makes work easy 
 Accelerate the speed and capacity of office work performed. 
 
Statement of the Problem 
 
Information Technology (IT) introduced a new wave in the teaching of business subject 
including accounting added to the fact that most of business organizations required their 
accountants to produce credible financial reports with computersoftware (Packages) and some 
aspects of hardware installation. According to Oguana (2003), the computer is invading all 
professions and posing serious challenges to the use of non-computer skills. 
In the labour market today, virtually all the sectors including accounting profession are 
daily being confronted by this challenge. Effective use of the computer hardware and software 
may be a problem, as they were not trained to use these computer elements. Accountants must 
show convincing evidence of working in the information technology office of today. The 
question now is what computer hardware and software are expected of them if they must be 
employed in the labour market of today’s business environment? 
The main objective of this study is to determine the hardware and software skills required 
of today’s accounting education curriculum in Ekiti State. Specifically, the study intends to: 
 Find out the hardware skills required by accountants in Ekiti State. 
 Ascertain the software skills required by accountant in Ekiti State. 
91 
 
 Determine whether these skills (Hardware/software skills) are properly utilized by 
accountants in business organizations in Ekiti state. 
 
 
Research Questions 
 
The following research questions guided the study; 
1) What hardware working knowledge skills as perceived by Universities Lecturers in Ekiti 
State are expected from accountants in Ekiti State? 
2) What software working knowledge skills as perceived by University Lecturers in Ekiti State 
are expected from accountants in Ekiti State? 
3) To what extent do accountants utilize hardware and software working knowledge skills as 
perceived by Universities Lecturers in Ekiti State/ 
 
Research Procedure 
 
The population of the study consisted of 35 respondents. The distributions of the 
population showed that accounting studies lecturers thus; 15(42.8%) were in Ekiti State 
university Ado-Ekiti, 11(31.4) Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti and 9(25.7%) Federal 
University, Oye-Ekiti. As the population is relatively small it constitutes the sample for the 
study. A survey research design was employed for this study. The main instrument was the 
questionnaire containing 35 items which was structured in such a way that the respondents were 
able to express their judgments using a five-point Likert type of scale. The data collected were 
analyzed using mean scores and standard deviation for each of the items of computer hardware 
and software skills. A mean score of 3.00 was considered significant. 
Question 1 and 2 attracts the response rate of highly expected 5, often expected 4, expected 
3, not expected and undecided 1, while question 3 on the other hand, and attracts the response 
rate of highly utilized, often utilized, utilized, not utilized and undecided. The entire 
questionnaire were properly filled and returned, this indicated 100% response rate.

Discussion  
 
Accountants in Ekiti State are expected of virtually all the hardware skills and some 
aspects of software skills.These skills include: Ability to 
 Utilize keyboarding using some special function keys and numeric keypad. 
 Provide a paper copy of the PC’s result using the computer printer. 
 Use scanner in reading information from paper, and transfer this as text or graphics on to a 
PC where it is stored and can be edited. 
 Communicate with the computer’s CPU by using various input devices to enter data run or 
programmes, or give commands to the CPU. 
Software skills on the other hand, include: 
 Ability to prepare memos, letters, documents using word processing such as Microsoft word . 
 Prepare and use database in storing all accounting information and records. 
 Prepare financial statement using spread sheet. 
 Prepare and display accounting information (accounting packages) using PowerPoint 
presentation. 
 
From the above findings, the same sets of hardware and software skills were utilized by the 
accountants in discharging their functions in the modern business organization located at Ado-
Ekiti, Ekiti State. Buttressing the above view, Umerah (2010) attested that computer is applied 
almost in all aspects of life including banking system, education, medical services, advanced 
productivity, research, military and revenue allocation. Ohakwe (2000) supporting the above 
view added that computer can be used to control stock, monetary analysis, recording accounting 
information such as sales, purchases, payroll accounting etc. 
Considering the findings made some aspect of software skills were neither expected nor 
utilized by the accountants in performing their duties in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. This indicates that 
computer services were not enough provided to these graduates during the course of their study 
in schools. With these conditions, how would accounting graduates (accountants) perform 
accounting jobs authoritatively in the labour market? No wonder Oguoma (2003) affirms that 
computer schools and departments are just shadows of themselves. Even where computer exists, 
it is not put to limited use. 
 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
Computer is an indispensable tool in the labour market today in making the recipients to be 
gainfully employed. With computer, services are rendered fast hence, it save s time, and this will 
97 
 
enable the employers of labour to employ those accountants who are capable of maximizing time 
in providing credible financial reports. Accountants who were not verse in computer usage in 
this era of technological influx will face a lot of challenges in the labour market. The software 
and hardware components of a computer complement each other, therefore the accounting 
education teachers should be exposed to these areas and they should impart the knowledge to 
their students. 
 
Recommendations 
 
Based on the findings made, the following recommendations were made; 
 The widespread usage of computer globally should serve as an eye opener to our tertiary 
institutions worldwide to make use of technology as a means of instructional methodology. 
 More software skills instruction should be given to accounting graduates as to equip them 
ready to face the challenges in the labour market. 
 Accounting educators should be trained and retrained in computer software and it’s 
application so that these knowledge acquired could be easily be transferred to accounting 
students. 
 There should be adequate curricula for trainers. 
 Accounting educators should be encouraged to attend conferences, seminars and workshops 
in this area as to widen the horizon of their knowledge. 
 Hardware and software skills should be made part of computer curriculum for training 
accounting students in Nigeria
