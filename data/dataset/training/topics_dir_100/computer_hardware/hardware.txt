Basic Hardware 
Main Board or Mother Board
• It is the most important element. The whole 
PC architecture is build on the main board.
• All devices and peripherials are connected 
to mother board.
• If we have a look at its basic structure we 
can easily identify:
1. Microprocessor Socket
2. BIOS (and Battery)
3. RAM memory slots (DIMM, DDR, ...)
4. Card Slots (PCI, ISA, AGP, ...)
5. Chipset
6. Connectors
• PS/2 (Keyboard, Mouse)
• USB
• IDE Bus
• Serial and parallel ports (COM & 
LPT1)
• Power supply (CN1)

Basic Hardware 
BIOS
(Basic Input/Output System)
•It is a memory (ROM) keeping a group 
of routines needed to control system 
devices.
•It allows booting process.
•System configuration is saved in a 
CMOS memory needing a battery not 
to loose the information.
•Some of them allow to configure 
Microprocessor or bus clock speed 
above their recomended values. This 
process is called Overclocking.

Basic Hardware 
Memory
•Caché Memory (L1, L2)
•Placed between RAM and Microprocessor.
•It is extremely fast but with low capacity and high cost.
•L1 is built in the Microprocessor.
•L2 can be found on the Main Board.
•Volatile (loses data when turned off).
•RAM (Random Acces Memory)
•Stores data temporarily.
•Higher capacity (Mbytes), cheaper and slower than 
Caché.
•Need a refresh not to loose data.
•Volatile (loses data when turned off).
•ROM (Read Only Memory)
•No-Volatile

Basic Hardware 
Microprocessor
•Also known as CPU (Central Processing Unit).
•Processes the data arriving from storage units and peripherials. 
•Modern Microprocessors work at two different speeds:
•Internal: the speed at which data can be processed.
•External: the speed used to communicate with Main Board.
CPU RAM Other 
units
System BUS

Basic Hardware 
Microprocessor Socket
Placed on mother board allows 
microprocessor connection
Computerised Tools – BBA 9
Basic Hardware 
Microprocessor
•In order to have optimum performance, overheating problems must be avoided.
•Thermic filling can help in heat dissipation.

Basic Hardware 
Microprocessor
•Other cooling methods as a fan 
can also be helpful.
Computerised Tools – BBA 11
Basic Hardware 
PCI Slots
•PCI cards can be connected to PCI 
slots placed on the mother board.
•This diverse purpose cards will appear 
perpendicular to the main board.
•Their external connectors will be 
accessible from the rear part in the PC 
tower.

Basic Hardware 
AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port)
Graphic card
Graphic card connected to the AGP 
Port
Graphic card output
Computerised Tools – BBA 13
Basic Hardware 
Power supply connector on Main Board
±12 and ±5 Volts are used to feed devices
Rear connector in a AT power supply 
Computerised Tools – BBA 14
Basic Hardware 
IDE Hard disk assembling IDE BUS and connectors
Computerised Tools – BBA 15
Basic Hardware 
IDE Devices Setup
•There are two IDE 
connectors on Mother 
Board.
•Two devices can be 
connected in each bus.
•It is necessary to specify 
who is master and who is 
slave in Primary and 
Secondary IDE ports.
•To decide so we can 
apply a hardware setup 
using jumpers.
•Each device will know its 
role.

Basic Hardware 
Rear connectors
•Peripherials as mouse, 
keyboard, printer or 
speakers can be
connected.
PS/2 and USB Ports
PS/2 mouse
Serial (COM 1 & 2) and 
Parallel (LPT 1) Ports 
Games (Joystick, Pads) 
and audio ports (mic, 
speakers)
