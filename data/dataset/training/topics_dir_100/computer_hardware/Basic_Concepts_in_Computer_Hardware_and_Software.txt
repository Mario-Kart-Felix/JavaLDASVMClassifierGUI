 
BASIC CONCEPTS IN COMPUTER HARDWARE AND 
SOFTWARE 
 
THE NEED FOR COMPUTER LITERACY 
“Information is power and Computers are amplifiers of information”  
When a pregnant woman collapsed into hepatic coma, a surgeon contacted a 
medical library. He needed immediate  
 
information on blood transfusions from the blood banks. Using a computer 
terminal and a retrieval program, the librarian searched more than half a 
million documents in just a few minutes. Necessary information was given to 
the surgeon and the patient recovered fully.  
Most information retrieval do not involve life-or-death decisions, but quicker 
computer assisted retrieval saves time and aggravation for many people.  
Information is a powerful commodity and is the driving force in our economy 
today. Since, the amount of available information doubles after every two 
years or so, managing it becomes vital. The computer in fact, helps us to 
manage information.  
Most of us, if not all of us are affected by the computer even if we are not 
actually using it. In the years to come, understanding the computer and its 
uses and being able to use it will become as necessary as being able to use a 
pen.  
Before understanding the various parts that constitute the computer and the 
working of the computer, let us list some of the benefits, applications and 
limitations of the computer.  
Benefits of Computers  
The three main benefits of using computers are :  
3 Speed  
3 Accuracy  
3 Capacity to take large amount of work.  
Computer work at a very high speed and are much faster than humans. The 
human equivalent of an average computer would be morethan one million 
mathematicians working 24 hours a day.  
In addition to being fast, computers are very accurate. If the input and the 
instructions are accurate the output will also be accurate.  
Unlike humans, computers do not get bored or tired. The monotony of 
repetitive work for long hours do not affect the computers.  
Applications of Computers  
Computers are used in various fields ranging from making cartoon films to 
space research. 
Some applications of computers are:  
3 Railway reservation 
3 Banking and Accounts  
3 Weather Forecast  
3 Space Research  
3 Medical Diagnosis  
3 Chemical Analysis  
 
Limitations of Computers  
The Computer is one of the most powerful tools ever developed. Yet, we read 
articles about instances, when a man received a telephone bill of Rs.10000, 
when he did not even have a telephone. Such failures sound amusing, but 
they happen because of human errors. 
 Computers have to be expressively told what to do. They cannot perform 
anything that is not defined.  
TYPES OF COMPUTERS  
Computers are categorized on the basis of size, sot and performance. 
Generally, the larger the system, the greater is its processing speed, storage 
capacity, cost and ability to handle large number of devices. The various 
types of computers are:  
3 Microcomputer  
3 Personal computers 
3 Minicomputers  
3 Mainframes  
3 Super computers  
Microcomputers 
 Systems on the lower end of the size of the size scale are 
microcomputers. They may be tiny special purpose devices dedicated to 
carrying out a single task such as one inside a camera.  
Personal Computers  
The most popular form of computer in use today is the Personal Computer 
generally known as the PC. The PC can be used for various applications. It 
can be defined as a single user oriented and general purpose microcomputer. 
It can perform a diverse range of functions, from keeping track of household 
accounts to keeping records of the stores of a large manufacturing company.  
 
Lap Top Computer  
Lately, the Palmtops and Laptops have become very popular with their power 
and portability. 
Mini Computers  
Mini computers are small, general-purpose computers. They can vary in size 
from a small desktop model to the size of a small filing cabinet.  A typical 
mini system is more expensive than a PC and surpasses of PC in storage 
capacity and speed. While most PCs are oriented towards single users, mini 
systems are designed to handle the needs of multiple users, i.e., more than 
one person can work on a mini at the same time.  
Mainframe Computers  
A mainframe is another form of a computer system that is generally more 
powerful than a typical mini. Mainframes themselves may vary widely in cost 
and capability. They are used in large organizations for large scale jobs. 
However, there is an overlap between the expensive minis and small 
mainframe models in terms of cost and capability.  
Super computers  
At the end of the size and capability scale, are the super computers. These 
systems are the largest, fastest and most expensive computers in the world. 
These computers are owned by large organizations. They are used for 
complex scientific applications.  
Special purpose and general purpose computers  
You have read about the applications and types of computers. Computers can 
also be categorized general purpose computers and special purpose 
computers, depending on their area of application.  
Special purpose computers are designed to perform specific functions only. 
Computers used in industrial process control, for example, in a washing 
machine, a space craft, or a robot fall under this category.  
General purpose computer on the other hand, are fast data manipulating 
systems. They are designed to automatically accept and store input data, 
process it, and output the information. Computers used in scientific 
applications weather forecasting, research and business data-processing like 
payroll fall under the general purpose category.  
DATA AND INFORMATION  
The word data is plural datum, which means fact or raw information. 
Information is organized or processed data. For example, 88, 99, 34 are 
numbers i.e., data. But they alone do not give any information as to what 
they are. However, if they are written as 
Subject Marks 
English 88 
Mathematics 99 
History 34 
then they become meaningful and are referred to as information. 
Working principle of a computer  
Just as a human being can be seen as a combination of body and mind, so can 
a computer. The computer is a two part system consisting of a body that is 
the hardware and a mind that is the software. A computer therefore, is a 
collection of electronic parts (body) with a set of instructions controlling it 
(mind).  
Most activities can be described in terms of the Input-Process-Output  (I-P-O) 
cycle. This can be best illustrated by an example.  
Let us assume that, you are asked to add 1346 and 2936 
3 You first hear the two numbers. 
3 Store the numbers in your memory. 
3 Your brain adds the two numbers. 
3 Then, the result (4281) is stored in your memory. 
3 You either speak out the result or write it down depending on 
requirement. 
The numbers are input, added and the result is output here, the inputs are 
1346 and 2935. the output is 4281. Your ear is the input device, brain is the 
processing unit, and mouth is the output device. 
A computer system too, follows the I-P-O cycle. To understand the I-P-O cycle 
of a computer, let us take the example of an airline reservation system. 
A person who wishes to travel by air from Singapore to New York fills in a 
reservation request slip. This slip contains relevant data, i.e., details of the 
name, age, place of destination, etc., of the customer. These customer details 
are the inputs. The process in this case, included examining the flight 
number, the date of the journey, the class requested, and determining 
whether seats are available as per the reservation details. 
As a result of this process, the information that either the person gets the 
reservation or is unable to get the reservation is output. The output may be 
in the form of a ticket, if seats are available, or a message turning down the 
request. Incase the customer is given reservation, his details are stored in a 
storage device. 
Now, let us see how each component of the PC system is related to the I-P-O 
cycle. The data in the form of request slip is input via the keyboard. Hence, 
the keyboard becomes the input device. The processing is performed by a 
component of the system unit called the microprocessor. 
The information regarding availability of seats is displayed on the display 
unit; Hence, the VDU becomes the output device. If a ticket is to be issued, it 
is printed on a printer which is also an output device.  
Thus, each component of the PC system is involved in the I-P-O cycle. The 
system unit does the processing. The other components -the VDU, the 
printer, and the keyboard are necessary in the input or output part of the I-P-
O cycle and are hence termed as I/O devices. Now you can identify the 
components of a PC as:  
i.  The monitor or the visual display unit (VDU) for output  
ii.  The keyboard for input  
iii. The system unit (CPU) for processing  
iv. The printer for output  
HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE  
Computer hardware includes all the electrical, mechanical, and the electronic 
parts of a computer. Any part that we can see or touch is the hard ware.  
Computer hardware includes  
     
3 System Unit  
3 Peripheral devices 
3 Input devices i.e. keyboard, mouse etc.  
3 Output devices i.e. Display Unit, printer etc. 
3 Storage devices like hard disk, floppy disks etc. 
Software:  
The functioning of the computer is not dependent on hardware alone. So, 
what else is required?  
It requires a set of instructions that tells the computer what is to be done 
with the input data. In computer terminology, this set of instructions is called 
a program and one or more programs is termed as software.  
Let us understand hardware and software with an example. An audio 
cassette when played gives you some sound. Here, the tape recorder and the 
audio cassette can be compared to hardware. The sound which comes from 
the tape recorder can be compared to software.  
Software used for computers may be of different types. Some of which are :  
3 Application Software  
3 System Software 
You read about application of computer and identified certain areas where 
computers are used today.  
Applicatioin Software  
Software specially suited for specific applications for example, railway and 
airline reservation, billing, accounting or software which enables creation 
and storage of documents are termed as application software.  
System software In the above airline reservation example, the clerk types 
your name and other details through the keyboard. But how does this go to 
the system unit? This activity is done by a set of instructions called the 
Operating Systems.  
The Operating System manages the various 1/0 devices of the computer and 
enables the user to interact with the machine.  
The computer understands only machine language i.e. 0’s and 1’s. In the 
above example how do you think it understands the reservation clerk’s query 
in English? There has to be a software which translates the user language 
into machine language.  
The software which does this translation is known as the support software. 
Examples of support software are compilers and interpreters.  
For example, if you go to Italy and you do not know Italian, you would need 
an interpreter to translate the English spoken by you into Italian. 
COMPUTER COMPONENTS IN DETAIL  
Keyboard :  
A computer keyboard closely resembles a typewriter keyboard. It has 
additional keys to handle special functions required by a computer.  
A computer keyboard has three categories of keys:  
3 Alphanumeric Keys (Alphabet & Numeric)  
3 Special purpose keys  
3 Function keys  
 
 
 
 
 
ACTIVITY 
 
1. Fill in the blanks. 
a. .............................. is similar to the conductor of an orchestra 
b. Computer programs are also known as 
 .............................................. 
c. A logical set of instructions to accomplish  a  job  on  a computer is called 
a ................. .................................................. 
d. The equipment of a computer system is called ................ 
.................................................. 
Alphanumeric keys  
Comprises of alphabets (A-Z), numbers (0-9) and other characters like  
Special keys  
They perform specific functions. Special keys are Enter (return), Backspace, 
Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up (PgUp), Page Down (PgDn), Num Lock, 
Caps Lock, Shift, Alt (Alternate), Ctrl (Control), Esc (Escape) and Cursor 
(Arrow) keys.  
Shift key when pressed with another key; alters the meaning of any 
alphanumeric key for e.g. Shift with key 5 gives you ‘%’  
The Ctrl and Alt keys when used with some other keys perform some special 
functions e.g. Ctrl, Alt and Del pressed together restarts the system. 
 
The Esc key is generally used to return to the previous menu or quit a 
program. The Cursor is a symbol displayed on the screen at the position 
where text or graphics will be inserted or deleted. The Cursor movement keys 
move the cursor on the screen.  
The Num Lock is used to activate the numeric keys on the Numeric keypad.  
When Num Lock is off the keys work like cursor movement keys.  
Scroll Lock is used to deactivate/activate scrolling of text on the screen.  
Print Screen is used to print whatever is displayed on the screen.  
Enter or Return is used to communicate the end of an instruction or data 
being keyed in through the keyboard.  
Caps lock is used for keying upper case alphabets.  
Backspace is used to erase the character to the left of the cursor position.  
The Function keys  
These are used to perform a set of operations using a single keystroke. The  
function keys can be defined as special purpose keys. In most of the software, 
pressing the F1 key will take you to the help feature. 
Other than these keys, 3 status indicator are present on the keyboard. They 
are Caps Lock on/off, NumLock on/off, Scroll Lock on/off indicators.  
Mouse  
A mouse is an input devise which is used to points  and select some options 
on the VDU. A mouse may have one, two or three buttons. The function each 
button depends on the program. 
When a user rolls the mouse across a flat surface, such as a desk, the screen 
cursor moves in the direction of the mouse’s movement. Clicking the mouse 
results in selecting an option.  
Positioning a cursor with the mouse is easier for non-typists than pressing 
various key combinations. With an appropriate software, a mouse can also be 
used to draw pictures.  
Scanner  
There are a number of situations when some information (picture or text) is 
available on paper and is needed on the computer disk for further 
manipulation. A scanner is used for this purpose A scanner scans an image 
and transforms it into ASCII (special code used by the computers) and 
graphics. These can be edited, manipulated and combined, and then printed.  
Scanner are used to reproduce photographs on the computer screen. These 
can be employed in training programs and in desktop publishing.  
System Unit  
The processing part of the I-P-O cycle takes place in the system unit. The 
system unit consists of primary storage, arithmetic-logic unit, and the control 
unit. The arithmetic-logic and control sections together make up the central 
processing unit (CPU).  
Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU)  
All calculation are performed in the arithmetic section, Operations like 
comparing takes place in the logic section of the CPU  
Control Unit  
The control section of the CPU controls and directs the operation of the entire 
system. It acts like the central nervous system for all the components though, 
it does not process any data.  
Primary Storage  
Primary storage is used for four purposes.  
 3 To store the input data until the CPU is ready for processing. 
 3 As a working storage space like a sheet of paper used for 
calculations. 
 3 As an output storage area that holds the finished results. 
 3 As a program storage area that stores the processing instructions. 
These separate areas are not fixed. The size of each area varies from 
application to application.  
Primary storage consists of RAM, ROM, and cache  
First of all you need to understand how the memory of a computer is 
organized.  
Bits and Bytes The computer can work with two states ON and OFF. ON 
state is represented by 1 and OFF state is represented by 0. This system of 
using 1’s and 0’s is called as the binary system. 
A ‘0’ or a ‘1’ is called a bit. A collection of 8 bits is known as a byte. The 
computer’s internal memory is organized as a collection of bytes. The size of 
memory available is measured in Kilobytes (KB) or Megabytes (MB). One 
Kilobyte represents 1024 bytes and one Megabyte represents 1024 Kilobytes.  
The computer uses three types memory-the RAM, the ROM and cache.  
RAM  
Random Access Memory (RAM) is the area that is used for holding the 
programs and their data while the computer is working with them. RAM 
means the memory  can be read from and written to randomly. The RAM is 
also known as short term memory because once the power is switched off all 
data in the RAM is erased. 
ROM 
It contains permanently recorded instructions that are vital for starting up a 
computer. Instructions in ROM can be read but cannot be changed, hence the 
name Read-Only Memory. Further, these instructions are not erased when 
power goes off One set of instructions found in the ROM is called the ROM-
BIOS which stands for Read Only Memory Basic Input Output Services. This 
set of programs perform the most basic control and supervisory operations for 
the computer. 
Cache Memory  
A computer’s CPU is a fast device. But the storage devices are not as fast as 
the CPU. Most of the time the CPU has to slow down because of these 
devices. A small section of the high speed RAM is used to keep frequently 
needed information. 
Secondary storage  
Computer’s primary storage or main memory is volatile and expensive. So, 
one need some storage device to store data and other information. It should 
be cheap and should not loose the content when power is switched off This 
storage is called as the secondary storage. All secondary storage devices act 
both as input and output devices. Magnetic storage media fulfills these 
requirements and most common storage devices are disks and tapes.  
 
 
 
Floppy Disk  
It is the most common storage media and it helps transferring the data from 
one computer to another. Floppies are classified based on their storage 
density and data storage sides as  
3 Single Sided Double Density (SSDD)  
3 Single side High Density (SSHD)  
3 Double Sided Double Density (DSDD) 
3 Double Sided High Density (DSHD)  
A diskette is divided into a series of concentric circles called tracks and 
within that into sectors. Data is stored in these sectors. Each piece of data 
that is stored, has a track number, a sector number and side number as an 
address. So data can be accessed randomly from anywhere on the disk. 
Hence, it is also called as Random Access storage.  
Floppies come in two sizes - 5     floppy and 3     inch floppy.  
Storage capacity of DSDD diskette is 360 KB. Storage capacity of a Double 
Sided High Density diskette is 1.2 Mb.  
Label Area you can write information like contents of floppy or the owner of 
the floppy.  
Write Protect Area When this area is covered, the disk cannot be written to, 
thus protecting your data. All important disks should be write-protected.  
Index hole This is used by the floppy drive to determine the first sector of the 
floppy.  
Read/Write Area This area is used by the floppy drive to read and write data 
to the diskette.  
The 3 1/2    inch floppy  
The 3 ½ inch double density floppy can store 720 KB and a high density 
floppy can store 1.44 MB. The diskette is packed in a plastic case and has a 
metal spring-loaded cover protecting the read/ write area.  
The write protect tab is on the lower side of the floppy. When the hole is 
closed you can write data onto the desk. 
The label area is on the top side and the index hole is located at the metal 
hub.  
Hard Disk  
The capacity of a hard disk is higher than that of a floppy. The most 
significant difference between a floppy disk and a hard disk is that the hard 
disk is completely sealed and is protected from dust and airborne particles.  
The name hard disk comes from the rigid platter that is inside the drive. This 
is , often called by different names like fixed disk or Winchester disk.  
The hard disk comes in different shapes. Most hard disks nowadays store 
something close to 500 MB. A hard disk has:  
3 Platters to store data  
3  Heads to read and write data from the platters.  
3 A motor to rotate the platters  
3 An electronic controller card that monitors the unit. 
Data is stored in cylinders. Cylinders are nothing but, collection of tracks 
located at the same distance from the outer edge of the each platter.  
Magnetic tapes  
Apart from using disks for external storage purposes, magnetic tapes are also 
used for storing large amount data.  
The magnetic tape could be a large reel or a small cassette. The tape is 
essentially a plastic ribbon coated with some material that can be 
magnetized. The data is recorded on these magnetic spots. 
The data on the tape can however be read or written sequentially only. 
Hence, it is called as sequential access storage.  
Visual Display Unit (VDU)  
This looks like a TV screen and is used to display information.  
VDUs can work in two different modes viz. Text mode and graphic mode.  
In text mode, the screen is divided into a matrix of rows and columns; each 
cell of the matrix is used for one character. A typical screen has 80 character 
positions per line and 25 lines across the screen.  
In graphic mode, the screen is treated as an array of tiny dots called pixels. 
The characters and pictures that appear on the screen are shown by making 
a drawing of these pixels. The number of dots on the screen is called as 
resolution. The higher the resolution the better the picture. 
A typical high resolution monitor has 1024 x 768 pixels across the screen.  
Further, a VDU can be a Colour VDU or a Monochrome depending on the 
video mode. The formation of images on the screen is handled by the Video 
Controller. The Video Controller along with the memory that holds the 
display-data are together referred to as display adaptors. Some examples of 
adaptors are Monochrome Graphics adaptor (MGA), Hercules Graphics 
Adaptor (HGS), Super Video Graphics Array (SVGA).

Printer  
In order to get a copy of the output for later reference You would require a 
printer. Printers are capable of printing at a very high speed. Two commonly 
used printers are the dot-matrix printer and the laser printer. Printers are 
classified on the basis of a number of parameters like, the mechanism used 
for printing, speed of printing, quality of output, direction of printing, and the 
kind of interface they have with the computer.  
Printers can be broadly classified as impact and non-impact printers.  
Let us understand this in detail.  
Impact Printers  
Impact printers work like typewriters.  
The characters are printed by striking the paper  i.e., characters are printed 
by pressing a typeface against an inked ribbon a paper. Impact printers can 
again be classified as Character printers and Line printers.  
Character Printers  
Character printers print one character at a time. Examples of character 
printers are. Dot Matrix Printer and Daisy Wheel Printer.  
Dot Matrix Printer  
The most commonly used impact printer is the dot-matrix printer (DMP). In 
a DMP, tiny hammers or pins strike the ribbon to produce the desired 
characters. The print head consists of 9x7 array of pins. Characters to be 
printed are sent one at a time to the printer. The characters printed are a 
series of dots.  
Dot-matrix are inexpensive but noisy. They can print both text and graphics. 
They can print in any language without additional hardware change. They 
can also be made to print in colour by changing ribbons. These printers are 
used everywhere to produce internal reports and memos needed by 
organizations.  
Daisy Wheel Printer  
In a daisy wheel printer, each petal has a character embossed on it. 
A motor spins the wheel along with it. When the desired character spins to 
the correct position, a print hammer strikes it to produce a character.  
Line printers  
Line printers print one line at a time. Hence, line printers are generally 
faster than character printers. Printing speed varies from 150 lines to 2500 
lines per minute. Some of the line printers are drum printers and chain 
printers. These can continuously print for a few hours.  
Drum printers  
A drum printer consists of a cylindrical drum. The characters to be printed 
are embossed on it.  
A set of print hammers one for each character in a line, are mounted in front 
of the drum A character is printed by striking the appropriate hammer 
against the embossed character on the surface. The drum completes one 
revolution to print one line.  
The movement of the drum and the striking of the hammer must 
synchronize. Otherwise, the printing will not be uniform. As printer drums 
are costly they cannot be changed often.  
Chain Printer  
A chain printer has a steel band on which the characters are embossed. The 
band is rotated at a high speed. As the band rotates, a hammer is activated 
when the desired character comes in front of it. For every character there will 
be a hammer. Here also, the hammer movement and the chain movement 
must be synchronized. The main advantage of the chain printer is that its 
chain can be easily changed. Thus, different fonts and scripts can be used 
with the same printer.  
Non-impact printers :  
In non-impact printers, there is no contact between the typeface and the 
paper while printing. Some examples of the non-impact are laser printer, 
thermal printer, and inkjet printer.  
Laser Printer  
Laser printers print one page at a time. Laser printers use a light beam to 
form images on the paper using a toner ink as the medium. Laser printers 
are quiet workers. They produce very high quality output both text and 
graphics. They are typically used publishing.  
Other Non-impact printers  
The other type of non-impact printers are thermal printers (which use heat to 
print characters on paper) and inkjet printers (which use jets of ink to print 
characters on paper). These printers are not in use as much as the laser 
printers. 
Printer Speed  
The speed of a printer is measured in terms of cps (characters per second), lps 
(lines per second) or ppm (pages per minute)  
The speed of  
3  a DMP is measured in cps  
3 a Drum printer or a Chain printer in lps  
3 a Laser printer in ppm  
The speed of the printers can vary widely. For example, the speed of a MSP-
145 is 240 cps while that of MSP-155 is 300 cps. A line printer speed can be 
anywhere from 5 to 50 lines per second. The speed of Xerox 4010 is 4 ppm. 
LASER Jet IIISi 17 ppm and MT908 is 8 ppm.  
Plotter  
A plotter is used to create high-quality visuals on paper, which a printer is 
incapable of doing. It can be used to create presentation-charts, graphics, 
tables and high quality technical drawings.  
There are two types of plotters : Drum and Flat Bed plotter.  
Drum Plotter  
The paper is placed over the drum that rotates back and forth. A carriage 
holding one or more pens is mounted horizontally across the drum. The 
carriage with the pens moves horizontally over the paper. Each pen could be 
filled with different colours. This plotter has the ability to produce colour 
pictures.  
Flat Bed Plotter  
In flat bed plotter, the paper does not move. The carriage holding the pens 
should provide all motions. Inkjet plotters can also produce large drawings 
with different colours. 
SYSTEM UNIT IN DETAIL  
Now that you are aware of the overall design of a computer system you can go 
into little more detail about each component inside your system unit. Though 
these details do not affect you as an end user, it completes your knowledge of 
the computer.  
 
 
System Unit  
It is a box like structure of the computer. Inside this box you can find the 
power supply, storage device, hard disk and floppy drives, and the mother 
board containing CPU and memory. 
It also contains expansion slots and cards to connect various input and 
output devices. It can also contain optional cards like the modem card, mouse 
card, video card, sound card. System unit or Main unit or Console comes in 
two styles. Desktop model and Tower model.  
Outside The Main Unit  
Indicators  
Power on indicator : it glows when the power is on.  
Hard disk activity indicator : this gives the information as to whether the 
hard disk is being accessed (read from or written to) or not.  
Turbo mode indicator : This indicator is found in the PCs having dual speed 
operation. It lets you know whether the system is running at a high or low 
speed. When the indicator is ON, it shows that computer is working in high 
speed mode (Turbo mode).  
Power switch : Depending on the model of the computer, power switch can be 
anywhere.  
Reset switch : Pressing this switch restarts your computer, your power 
supply.  
Turbo switch : It is used for changing the speed of your computer to the 
Turbo mode.  
Key lock: Thus is meant for locking the keyboard. Once it is locked, the 
computer does not accept any input from the keyboard.  
Inside The System Unit  
The Internal Power Supply  
One of the main components inside the system unit is the power supply. 
The Microprocessor  
The CPU or the main microprocessor is the most important chip on the 
motherboard. The entire design of the PC is based on this chip. The 
computer’s performance depends directly on the CPU. The performance of 
CPU depends on the model, version and speed.  
Model  
Each CPU has a specific model number assigned to it. Given below is the list 
of common CPUs produced by Intel company in an increasing order of their 
power, speed and performance.  
80386, 80486, 80586 or Pentium.  
Version  
in each Model of CPU you may find further variations, such as SX, DX, DX2 
etc. In this, SX is less powerful than DX and DX is less powerful than DX2. 
Speed  
The speed is measured in Megahertz. Higher the value, faster is the 
information processed by CPU  
Clock  
All components should work in perfect synchronization, for the computer to 
produce the desired results. The clock provides the timing signals in the form 
of pulses that are used by the computer components to synchronize their 
work. The clock chip uses a quartz crystal. The speed of the clock is measured 
in MHz.  
Speed of Operation  
Speed of a computer can be assessed either in terms of the processing 
capacity of the microprocessor or by the speed of the computer is measured in 
MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second).  
80386 Model can process 32 bits at a time, has a clock speed of 33 MHz and 
has a speed of 0.4 MIPS.  
The Memory  
The internal memory of the PC is in the form of chips.  
The Bus  
Communication between the microprocessor, the memory chips, and another 
chips found on the motherboard is accomplished a set of wires running 
between them. This set of wires is called the bus. 
The Ports 
As in human terminology, ports are used to receive and send goods. 
Similarly, the I/O devices like the keyboard, the printer etc. are connected to 
the system unit through ports. These ports could be serial or parallel. a serial 
port, is one where eight bits queued up and sent bit. In the parallel port all 
the eight bits are transferred simultaneously. 
The Storage System 
The hard disk drive and floppy diskette drive are also mounted in the system 
unit. 
How Does A System Start? 
The Start-up Process 
Every time a computer is switched on, it goes through a series before the user 
is permitted to interact with it. 
Stored in the ROM is a set of instructions that check each functional areas of 
the computer. These instructions are called the power on self test (POST) 
program. Forms a part of the ROM-BIOS. The POST checks the entire RAM 
area and tests the connections to the various hardware devices attached, like 
the keyboard, the disk drive, etc. 
If problem occurs with any of the connections to the hardware devices or with 
the RAM, POST program reports this on the screen. 
The bootstrap process 
Once the POST is over the next stage is called the ‘bootstrap’ process. Now 
the computer waits for the operating system to take over. In the BIOS itself, 
there is small program called the bootstep loader, which copies the Operating 
System from the floppy or hard disk to the RAM. The bootstrap loader first 
checks the A drive for a bootable disk. (A disk that has the Operating System 
is a bootable disk). If the disk in that drive is not bootable, an errors reported 
if the floppy is not there in the drive, the hard disk drive is checked. If the 
hard disk also does not have the operating system then the computer reports 
‘Boot disk failure’. This process of loading or copying the operating system is 
called booting. 
Soft boot and Hard boot 
The Computer system can be restarted by pressing the keys <Ctrl>, <Alt>, 
and <Del> simultaneously. This is known as a soft boot. Using the reset 
switch or switching off and then switching on the computer is known as a 
hard boot. 
Know your Computer ..... And care for it 
Connecting your Computer 
You must first comprehend the two main steps needed to get your PC 
working They are : 
3 Connecting the sytem unit, monitor, printer to the power supply. 
3 Connecting the various components, etc., the monitor (VDU). Keyboard, 
Mouse, And printer to the system unit. 
Before making connections, make sure that the power supply to the PC, 
printer and monitor is off, Connecting your system while the power is on may 
cause permanent damage to the computer and its peripherals. 
Keyboard-System Unit Connection 
Plug the keyboard into the circular keyboard socket (also called a port or 
interface in computer jargon) on the rear panel. The position of the keyboard 
socket on your system may be different. 
Before inserting the cable, make sure that the pin in the cable are lined up 
with respect to the holes in the connector. Make sure the keyboard plug is 
firmly fitted in the keyboard socket. 
Monitor-System Unit Connection 
Monitor has two cables. One is connected between the monitor and computer, 
referred to as the video cable. The other cable is connected between monitor 
and power socket called the power cable. The power outlet may be present on 
the rear panel of the system unit, in which case the power plug must be 
connected to this outlet. Otherwise, it should be connected to the main power 
supply. 
The video cable will go into the respective socket only Generally, in all the 
PCs this socket is marked as ‘MON’. 
Mouse-System Unit Connection 
The rear panel of a system unit has both serial and parallel ports. The serial 
ports are numbered as COM1, COM2, ... and parallel ports are numbered as 
LPT1, LPT2, A mouse could be a serial port mouse or a parallel port mouse. 
You will have to connect it accordingly.  
Connecting a mouse to the machine is not enough. A dedicated program 
called the driver which comes with the mouse has to be executed as per 
installation procedures given in the accompanying manual. 
Printer-System Unit Connection  
Printer unit has two cables. One connecting the printer to the computer and 
another connecting it to the power supply.  
Printers are of two types-serial and parallel. Your printer manual will tell 
you what kind of printer you have. One end of the printer cable will be 
connected to the appropriate port on the real panel. The other end of the 
cable has to be connected to the printer. The connector is tapered .so that you 
can only connect the cable one way.  
Normally, you will find small wire clamps on either side of the port to hold 
the connector securely. With the cable connected, press the wire clamps into 
the notches. 
Power Connection  
It is better to connect the PCs to some constant power supply device. This is 
required to avoid any damage that could be caused because of power 
fluctuations. The commonly used protection devices are Voltage Stabilizers, 
Constant Voltage Transformers (CVTs), and Uninterrupted Power Supplies 
(UPSs).  
In case, you have a CVT or an UPS, connect your computer’s power cable to 
the CVT or UPS. The CVT’s power cable in turn is to be connected to the 
mains.  
Operating your Monitor  
The ON/OFF switch is used to switch on/ switch off the monitor. A monitor 
has a light indicator to show whether it is on or off. 
The brightness and contrast control knobs are used to adjust the brightness 
and sharpness of the text or image on the screen, respectively (similar to the 
controls present on a TV).  
Some monitor also have knobs to position the image at the centre of the 
screen, these are the vertical shift and horizontal shift knobs used to shift the 
image vertically and horizontally, respectively. When you are satisfied that 
everything is working as it should, turn the power switch off to stop the test. 
Maintaining your Computer  
To keep your computer system working properly, it is necessary to protect the 
hardware from environmental hazards, unreliable power supply and natural 
calamities.  
The following are some do’s and don’ts for a computer and its components.  
General Precautions  
Points to be borne in mind while using your PC:  
 Do  
 Keep your computer system in a cool, dry, and dust-free environment.  
 Ensure that the power switches on the system unit, monitor and printer 
are OFF before switching on the mains.  
 Switch off the monitor, system unit and the printer, before switching off 
the mains. 
 Clean the computer work area everyday; cover your system at the end of 
the day.  
 Keep your system away from room walls to ensure proper air flow 
around the computer.  
 Do Not  
 Allow eating or drinking near the computer.  
 Smoke in the vicinity of your computer.  
 Allow direct sunlight to fall on your computer. 
 Run any electric equipment like a vacuum cleaner in the vicinity of the 
computer when it is on.  
 
Maintaining your System Unit  
 Do  
 Park the hard disk before shifting the machine, when the unit needs to 
be transferred from one site to another.  
 Parking refers to positioning the disk head on an unused area to ensure 
that the head does not damage the disk.  
 Handle the floppy drive lever gently.  
 Ensure that there is no diskette in the floppy drive before switching off 
the system unit. 
  
 Do Not  
 Switch on the system with a data floppy in the drive. 
 Insert or remove the diskette when the drive select indicator is glowing.  
 Switch off the system when the hard disk drive is active, i.e. when the 
indicator is glowing. 
Maintaining your Monitor  
 Do  
 Keep the brightness and contrast at minimum before switching on the 
system, and increase it to the appropriate level thereafter.  
 Do Not 
 Try to open the VDU and touch the parts as these parts may carry high 
voltage.  
Maintaining Your Keyboard  
 Do  
 Clean the keyboard regularly.  
 Use a vacuum cleaner keyboards as it can extract the dust collected 
between the keys. 
 Do Not  
 Strike the keys hard as those of a manual typewriter since these keys 
are soft touch.  
 Rest your hands on the keyboard.   
 Keep anything on the keyboard.  
 Use the keys after switching off the system. 
 Stretch the keyboard cable. 
Maintaining your Mouse  
 Do  
 Use a mouse pad.  
 If you do not have one, make sure you place the mouse on a clean 
surface.  
Cleaning a mouse  
 The ball and the rollers must be kept free of dust, dirt and grime. Most 
mice can be opened and cleaned, clean them once in two months, or 
when you notice that the pointer on the screen is not moving smoothly. 
Following are the general steps to clean the mouse. Refer to the manual 
to check for any variations.  
 Switch off the power supply and disconnect the mouse.  
 Remove the back cover (refer to the mouse manual to do this).  
 Remove the ball.  
 Clean the ball with lukewarm water and mild detergent; see that you do 
not scratch its surface.  
 Dry the ball with a soft cloth.  
 Carefully clean the rollers using a toothpick, cotton wool or a soft cloth.  
 Replace the ball in its chamber. 
 Connect the cable and switch on the supply.  
 Do Not  
 Pull the mouse cable.  
Expose the mouse to excessive moisture.  
ACTIVITY 
 Create a file and feed sample data. 
List out the various configuration of the computers and the move - discuss 
the merits and demerits.
