Barankin Vector Locally Best Unbiased Estimates∗
Bruno Cernuschi-Fŕıas†
Abstract
The Barankin bound is generalized to the vector case in the mean
square error sense. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained to
achieve the lower bound. To obtain the result, a simple finite dimensional
real vector valued generalization of the Riesz representation theorem for
Hilbert spaces is given. The bound has the form of a linear matrix in-
equality where the covariances of any unbiased estimator, if these exist,
are lower bounded by matrices depending only on the parametrized prob-
ability distributions.
Keywords: Parameter estimation, unbiased estimation, optimal estimator,
Barankin bound, performance bounds, linear matrix inequalities, minimal co-
variance matrix, Cramer-Rao bound.
1 Introduction
The problem considered, following Barankin, [2], and results in Banach, [1], is
the optimal unbiased estimation of a deterministic vector of parameters ν of
a family of probability measures Pν , or more generally a known real vector
function of these parameters g(ν), using a realization of a vector random vari-
able X drawn from PνT . The first issue is to find a function ψ such that∫
ψ(X ) dPν = g(ν), for all ν in some admissible set. This problem is a vector
integral equation and may or may not have a solution, [6, 20]. Furthermore, even
if it has solution, it may not have a solution with finite covariance matrix for νT .
Barankin, under very simple hypothesis, [2], gives an if and only if condition
for the existence of a minimal s-th variance unbiased estimator for the scalar
case, which is tighter than the classical Cramer-Rao or Bhattacharyya bounds
if they exist. In recent years the Barankin bound has attracted attention, since
there are problems for which the Cramer-Rao or Bhattacharyya bounds give
no satisfactory solution, see e.g. [22], and references there. Following [2], the
problem studied here is under what conditions there exists a finite covariance

vector unbiased estimator of the true vector parameter νT , and in that case if
a minimal covariance vector unbiased estimator exists.
In Section 2 an overview is presented of the relevant results of measure the-
ory and the Lebesgue integral related to the Barankin formulation. In Section
3 the vector Barankin bound generalization is presented as a linear matrix in-
equality (LMI). In Section 4 the Barankin functional analysis formalization is
generalized to handle the vector case. In Section 5 a finite dimensional real vec-
tor valued generalization of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces
is presented. In Section 6 necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the
existence of an optimal vector estimator attaining the bound given by the LMI
obtained in Section 3. In Section 7 other alternative LMI formulations for the
existence of an optimal vector estimator are given.
2 Formalization of the vector estimation prob-
lem
2.1 Measure theoretic setup
Let (Ω,F ) be a measurable space, where Ω is a well defined abstract set, and
F is a sigma-algebra of subsets of Ω, [14]. Let Θ be an abstract arbitrary set
of sub-indexes with no conditions on its structure as in [2], p. 477. Let B
be a collection of probability measures Pθ for the measurable space (Ω,F ),
indexed by the sub-indexes θ ∈ Θ, i.e. B =
{
Pθ : θ ∈ Θ
}
, as in [2] p. 477.
Hence for each θ ∈ Θ, the triple (Ω,F ,Pθ) is a probability space. Let X
be a vector random variable, i.e. a measurable function from the measurable
space (Ω,F ) to the measurable space (RdS , BdS ), where RdS is the vector
dS-dimensional real space, and BdS is the Borel sigma-algebra for RdS , that
is the minimal sigma-algebra generated, e. g., by the open sets of RdS . Then
X is a real vector random variable iff ∀B ∈ BdS we have X −1(B) ∈ F , if
and only if each component of the vector is a real random variable, [17] p. 19.
Define for each θ ∈ Θ the measure Pθ, for the measurable space (RdS , BdS ),
induced by the random variable X , [10] p. 34, i.e. for each B ∈ BdS define
Pθ(B) = Pθ(X −1(B)). Hence for each θ ∈ Θ the random variable X induces
the probability space (RdS , BdS , Pθ).
Let ψ be a real measurable vector function from (RdS , BdS ) to (RdP , BdP ),
that is ψ : RdS → RdP , and for each B ∈ BdP we have ψ−1(B) ∈ BdS .
For the measurable vector function ψ from (RdS ,BdS ) to (RdP ,BdP ), define
the i-th component of the vector ψ as [ψ]i, which is a measurable function
from (RdS ,BdS ) to (R,B) for each 1 ≤ i ≤ dP iff ψ is measurable. Define
L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ) as the collection of all the measurable vector functions ψ from
(RdS ,BdS ) to (RdP ,BdP ), such that
∫ ∣∣[ψ]i∣∣dPθ < +∞, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP , equiva-
lently, [ψ]i ∈ L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ), for all 1 ≤ i ≤ dP , so that L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ) =(
L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ)
)dP
.
Hence ψ(X ) is a random variable from (Ω,F ) to (RdP ,BdP ), since for
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 3
B ∈ BdP we have
[
ψ(X )
]−1
(B) = X −1
(
ψ−1(B)
)
, but B ∈ BdP so that
ψ−1(B) ∈ BdS and then X −1
(
ψ−1(B)
)
∈ F .
Define the integral of a vector of functions as a vector whose elements are
the integrals of each function. Then, [10] p. 45:∫
ψ(X ) dPθ =
∫
ψ dPθ
Note that the integral on the left is with respect to the probability space
(Ω,F ,Pθ), while the integral on the right is with respect to the probability
space (RdS , BdS , Pθ). We will refer indistinctly to ψ(X ) and ψ as an estima-
tor, with the understanding that they refer to different probability spaces linked
by the previous equality of integrals.
For ψ ∈ L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ) define the expectation of ψ as Eθ [ψ] =∫
ψ(X ) dPθ =
∫
ψ dPθ.
We assume that the random variable X is drawn from some specific prob-
ability measure (p. m.) PθT , with θT ∈ Θ, i. e. we will use the realization
of this random variable to obtain the estimator for g(θT ). The random vector
ψ(X ) is an unbiased estimator for g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ , g : Θ → RdP , if the integral∫
ψ(X ) dPθ is well defined, ∀θ ∈ Θ, and we have
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ =
∫
ψ dPθ =
g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ.
Then the first issue posed in the introduction may be formally stated as:
Problem 2.1 (Basic Problem). Given a function g : θ → RdP , defined for each
θ ∈ Θ, and a family of p.m.’s indexed by θ ∈ Θ, find an unbiased estimator,
i.e. find a function ψ ∈ L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, such that
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ =∫
ψ dPθ = g(θ), for all θ ∈ Θ.
Define the integral of a matrix Ψ of dimensions N ×M , N,M ∈ N, whose
elements belong to L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ), as a matrix whose elements are the in-
tegrals of the elements of Ψ, so that Eθ[Ψ(X )] =
∫
Ψ(X ) dPθ =
∫
Ψ dPθ.
For a measurable square integrable function f : (RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) → (R,B), i.e.
f ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ),
Define L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) as the collection of all the measurable functions u
from (RdS ,BdS ) to (RdP ,BdP ), such that
∫
[u]
2
i dPθT < +∞, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP ,
equivalently, [u]i ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), for all 1 ≤ i ≤ dP . If the non-centered
second order moments of the components of the estimator ψ exist for θT , i.e.
[ψ]i ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP , so that ψ ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) ≡(
L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT )
)dP
, then, the first order moments of the components of the
estimator exist for θT . Also, the correlations
∫
[ψ]i [ψ]j dPθT , are well defined
and are finite for all i 6= j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dP , and using the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality, we obtain
∣∣∣ ∫ [ψ]i [ψ]j dPθT ∣∣∣ ≤ ‖[ψ]i‖L2 ∥∥∥[ψ]j∥∥∥L2 . Additionally as-
sume ψ(X ) is unbiased ∀θ ∈ Θ, then the covariance matrix of ψ(X ) exists for
θT , and we have CovθT (ψ) =
∫ [
(ψ(X )− g(θT )) (ψ(X )− g(θT ))T
]
dPθT =
EθT
[
(ψ − g(θT )) (ψ − g(θT ))T
]
= EθT
[
ψ ψT
]
− g(θT ) g(θT )T .
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 4
In the same direction of [2], with s = r = 2, instead of the general Problem
2.1, we pose the problem in terms of estimators with finite covariance matrix at
θT :
Problem 2.2 (Finite Covariance Problem). Given a function g : θ → RdP ,
defined for each θ ∈ Θ, and a family of p.m.’s indexed by θ ∈ Θ, find a func-
tion ψ ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), with ψ ∈ L1(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, such that∫
ψ dPθ = g(θ), for all θ ∈ Θ. If there are several solutions find, if possible, a
solution with minimal covariance matrix at θT .
2.2 Centered definitions
Define ϕ = ψ − g(θT ), and h(θ) = g(θ) − g(θT ) so that h(θT ) = 0. If ψ is
unbiased, then, since
∫
ψ dPθ = g(θ) and
∫
g(θT ) dPθ = g(θT ), for all θ ∈ Θ,
then,
∫
(ψ − g(θT )) dPθ = g(θ) − g(θT ), for all θ ∈ Θ, so that
∫
ϕ dPθ =
h(θ) ∀θ ∈ Θ, and CovθT (ψ) = EθT
[
ϕ ϕT
]
. Also, if ψ is unbiased, then, since
h(θT ) = 0, then EθT[ϕ] =
∫
ϕ dPθT = 0.
2.3 Barankin formulation: basic hypothesis
Following Barankin we will introduce some simple additional hypothesis re-
sumed in Barankin’s Postulate in [2] p. 481.
Hypothesis 2.1. The set Θ is an arbitrary index set with no conditions on its
structure, [2] p. 477, and B is a collection of probability measures Pθ for the
measurable space (Ω,F ), i.e. B =
{
Pθ : θ ∈ Θ
}
as in [2], p. 477. The random
variable X : (Ω,F ) → (RdS ,BdS ) is drawn from the probability measure (p.
m.) PθT , with θT ∈ Θ. Assume that for each θ ∈ Θ the p.m. Pθ is absolutely
continuous with respect to PθT , i.e Pθ << PθT , with θT ∈ Θ.
Lemma 2.1. If Hypothesis 2.1 is true then for each θ ∈ Θ the p.m. Pθ is
absolutely continuous with respect to PθT , i.e. Pθ << PθT .
Proof. Assume B ∈ BdP is such that PθT (B) = 0, then since PθT (B) =
PθT (X
−1(B)), we obtain PθT (X
−1(B)) = 0. But Pθ << PθT , hence
Pθ(X −1(B)) = 0. Since Pθ(B) = Pθ(X −1(B)), then Pθ(B) = 0.
Observation 2.1. In the case in which every index θ ∈ Θ is a possible candidate
for θT , then, Hypothesis 2.1 should require that for each θ1 ∈ Θ the p.m. Pθ1
should be absolutely continuous with respect to each other p.m. Pθ2 with
θ2 ∈ Θ, and then Pθ1 << Pθ2 for all θ1, θ2 ∈ Θ.
As a consequence of the previous hypothesis and lemma, the Radon-Nykodim
derivatives dPθ/dPθT and dPθ/dPθT exist for all θ ∈ Θ, [15] p. 315.
Definition 2.1. Define π(θ) = dPθ/dPθT , with π(θ) ≡ πθ(x, θT ), x ∈ RdS , so
that dPθ/dPθT = πθ(X , θT ). Define B0 = {π(θ) : θ ∈ Θ}, see [2], p. 481.
We have π(θ) ≥ 0 w.p. 1, for all θ ∈ Θ, [15] p. 315, π(θT ) = 1 w.p. 1, and∫
πθ(X , θT )dPθT =
∫ (
dPθ/dPθT
)
dPθT =
∫
dPθ = 1, for all θ ∈ Θ.
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 5
Hypothesis 2.2. 1. Assume that for each θ there is one and only one π(θ) ∈
B0, i.e. the correspondence π : Θ→ B0 is one-to-one.
2. There are at least two values θ1, θ2 ∈ Θ, such that g(θ1) 6= g(θ2).
Observation 2.2. Item 1 avoids the identifiability problem, [12], pp. 58 and
191. Item 2 implies that we do not consider estimators which are constant with
probability 1: if it was ψ = α0 w.p. 1 for some α0 ∈ RdP , then
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ1 =∫
α0 dPθ1 = α0, similarly
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ2 = α0, but since we assume that ψ is
unbiased, it should be
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ1 = g(θ1) and
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ2 = g(θ2), and
then it should be g(θ1) = α0 = g(θ2), which is a contradiction. Additionally,
Hypothesis 2.2 implies that there exists at least a θ0 ∈ Θ such that g(θ0) 6= 0.
Nonetheless, see e.g. [2] p. 482 and [7] p. 2440, for some comments regarding
constant estimators.
2.4 Barankin postulate
The following hypothesis is Barankin’s Postulate in [2], p. 481, for s = r = 2.
Hypothesis 2.3 (Barankin, [2], Postulate p. 481). Assume that
π(θ) ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) ∀θ ∈ Θ
equivalently B0 ⊆ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ).
Observation 2.3. Since
∫
π(θ) dPθT =
∫ (
dPθ/dPθT
)
dPθT =
∫
dPθ = 1, for all
θ ∈ Θ, then ‖π(θ)‖L2 6= 0, for all θ ∈ Θ, equivalently ‖u‖L2 6= 0, for all u ∈ B0.
If not, ‖π(θ)‖L2 = 0 implies π(θ) = 0 w.p. 1, and then
∫
π(θ) d PθT = 0,
contradiction. Additionally note, taking in account Hypothesis 2.2, that B0
has at least two elements.
Suppose ψ ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), since π(θ) ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) for all
θ ∈ Θ, then the integrals
∫
ψ π(θ) dPθT are well defined for all θ ∈ Θ, and we
have all the equivalent forms:∫
ψ π(θ) dPθT =
∫
ψ
dPθ
dPθT
dPθT =
∫
ψ dPθ
=
∫
ψ(X ) dPθ =
∫
ψ(X )
dPθ
dPθT
dPθT = EθT[ψ π(θ)]
If ψ ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) is unbiased, then for ϕ = ψ − g(θT ) we have
EθT[ϕ π(θ)] =
∫
ϕ π(θ) dPθT = h(θ) ∀ θ ∈ Θ (2.1)
The introduction of the functions π reduces the consideration of the multi-
ple probability spaces L2(RdS ,BdS ,Pθ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, to a single probability space
L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ).
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 6
2.5 Probability density function form
Call λ the Lebesgue measure for the measurable space (RdS , BdS ), i.e. the
measure that assigns to parallelepipeds in RdS the value given by the product
of the lengths of the edges of the parallelepiped in each direction. Alternatively
call dλ = dx, with x ∈ RdS . If in turn we have PθT << λ, i.e. the p.m. PθT
is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then, Pθ <<
PθT << λ, so that Pθ << λ, and then the Radon-Nykodim derivatives dPθ/dλ
exist, for all θ ∈ Θ. These derivatives are the probability density functions (pdf)
pθ ≡ pθ(x) ≡ dPθ/dλ with x ∈ RdS . Since, [15] p. 328,
pθ =
dPθ
dλ
=
dPθ
dPθT
dPθT
dλ
= π(θ) pθT λ−ae
then, if ψ is unbiased
g(θ) =
∫
ψ dPθ =
∫
ψ pθ dλ =
∫
ψ π(θ) pθT dλ
2.6 The Main Problem
With all the previous considerations we may formalize the generalization to the
vector case of the Barankin formulation as:
Problem 2.3 (Main Problem). Given a function g : θ → RdP , defined for each
θ ∈ Θ, and a family of p.m.’s indexed by θ ∈ Θ, that satisfy the Hypothesis 2.1,
2.2, and 2.3, find a function ψ ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), such that
∫
ψ π(θ) dPθT =
g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ. If there are several solutions find, if possible, a solution with
minimal covariance matrix at θT .
The solution to this problem is given below in Theorem 7.3.
3 Matrix bound
For a vector a in a finite vector space denote [a]i the i-th component of the
vector. For a matrix A, define [A]i as the i-th column of the matrix and [A]i,j
as i-th, j-th element of the matrix. We have [A]i,j =
[
[A]j
]
i
. Denote AT the
transpose of the matrix A, Det(A) the determinant of A, and Tr [A] the trace
of A. A square symmetric real matrix A ∈ RN×N is a symmetric non-negative
definite (s.n.n.d.) matrix iff, xTAx ≥ 0, for all x ∈ RN . A real s.n.n.d. matrix
A ∈ RN×N is a symmetric positive definite (s.p.d.) matrix if Det(A) 6= 0, iff
xTAx > 0, for all x 6= 0. Two s.n.n.d. matrices A ∈ RN×N and B ∈ RN×N are
comparable in the Löwner partial order, [24] p. 166, if either A− B is s.n.n.d.
and then A ≥ B, or if B − A is s.n.n.d. and then B ≥ A, else, they are not
comparable. For A, B and C s.n.n.d of dimensions N ×N , then if A ≥ B and
B ≥ C then A ≥ C, and if A ≥ B and B ≥ A, then A = B, see e.g. [7]
Lemma 3 p. 2444. If A ∈ RN×N is s.p.d., and S ∈ RN×M is arbitrary, such
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 7
that STAS = 0, then S = 0, see e.g. [7] Lemma 2 p. 2444. For A ∈ RN×N
denote the Frobenius norm as ‖A‖F =
(
Tr(AAT )
)1/2
.
The following lemma is a variant of the information inequality [25] p. 172,
[13] Lemma 1 p. 1288, [19] pp. 326–328.
Lemma 3.1. Let (X,X, µ) be an arbitrary measure space. Let L2(X,X, µ) be
the collection of all the measurable square integrable real valued functions from
X to R. Let dγ , dρ, dA ∈ N, γ ∈ (L2(X,X, µ))dγ , ρ ∈ (L2(X,X, µ))dρ , and A ∈
RdA×dρ . Call F =
∫
γ ρT dµ, F ∈ Rdγ×dρ , and B =
∫
ρ ρT dµ, B ∈ Rdρ×dρ .
If Det
(
A B AT
)
6= 0, then
∫
γ γT dµ ≥ F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
A FT , with
equality if and only if there exists a matrix Λ0 ∈ Rdγ×dA such that γ = Λ0 A ρ
µ-almost-everywhere (µ-ae), and in that case, it is Λ0 = F A
T
(
A B AT
)−1
.
Proof. For each Λ ∈ Rdγ×dA , let M(Λ) =
∫
(γ − ΛAρ) (γ − ΛAρ)T dµ, M(Λ) ∈
Rdγ×dγ . Then M(Λ) is s.n.n.d. for all Λ ∈ Rdγ×dA . We have M(Λ) =∫
γ γT dµ − F AT ΛT − Λ A FT + Λ A B AT ΛT . By assumption
Det
(
A B AT
)
6= 0, so that the matrix A B AT is invertible. Define Λ0 =
F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
, then, M(Λ0) =
∫
γ γT dµ− F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
A FT ≥ 0
so that
∫
γ γT dµ ≥ F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
A FT , and there is equality iff
M(Λ0) = 0. From the definition of M(Λ), if there exists Λ? ∈ Rdγ×dA such
that γ = Λ? A ρ µ-ae, then M(Λ?) = 0. In that case it will be
∫
γ ρTdµ =
Λ? A
∫
ρ ρTdµ, so that F = Λ? A B, and then F AT = Λ? A B AT .
Since by hypothesis A B AT is invertible, then Λ? = F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
=
Λ0 so that M(Λ0) = M(Λ
?) = 0, and then we obtain the equality. Con-
versely, if
∫
γ γT dµ = F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
A FT , take Λ0 ∈ Rdγ×dA , as
Λ0 = F A
T
(
A B AT
)−1
, so that by the definition of M(Λ) it results M(Λ0) =∫
(γ − Λ0 A ρ) (γ − Λ0 A ρ)T dµ =
∫
γ γT dµ− F AT
(
A B AT
)−1
A FT = 0.
Hence Tr (M(Λ0)) = Tr
(∫
(γ − Λ0 A ρ) (γ − Λ0 A ρ)T dµ
)
=∑dγ
i=1
∫
[γ − Λ0 A ρ]2i dµ = 0, and then γ = Λ0 A ρ µ-ae.
The following definition specifies all the elements required in the proposed
linear matrix inequality (LMI) generalized Barankin bound.
Definition 3.1. Given arbitrary dM ∈ N and dA ∈ N, an arbitrary real matrix
A of dimensions dA × dM , A ∈ RdA×dM , and arbitrary indexes θi ∈ Θ, for
1 ≤ i ≤ dM , define τ T = (θ1, θ2, . . . , θdM ), τ ∈ ΘdM , and define the quad-tuple
q, as q = (dM , dA, A,τ ). Define h(θ) = g(θ)− g(θT ).
Define βT (τ ) = (π(θ1), π(θ2), . . . , π(θdM )), i.e. β(τ ) ∈ B0
dM , define the dP ×
dM real matrix G(τ ) as G(τ ) =
(
g(θ1) − g(θT ), g(θ2) − g(θT ), . . . , g(θdM ) −
g(θT )
)
=
(
h(θ1), h(θ2), . . . , h(θdM )
)
, and define the dM × dM real matrix
B(τ ) as B(τ ) = E
[
β(τ ) βT (τ )
]
.
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 8
Define CA as the collection of all the quad-tuples q with Det
(
A B(τ ) AT )
)
6= 0.,
i.e.
CA =
{
q : ∀ dM ∈ N,∀ dA ∈ N,∀ A ∈ RdA×dM ,
∀ τ ∈ ΘdM , with Det
(
A B(τ ) AT )
)
6= 0
}
.
Definition 3.2. Call Ug the family of all the finite covariance at θT unbiased
estimators of g(θ), for all θ ∈ Θ, for Problem 2.3. Define WA as the collection
of matrices of the form:
W (q) = G(τ ) AT
(
A B(τ ) AT
)−1
A GT (τ ) ∀q ∈ CA
i.e. ∀dM ∈ N, ∀dA ∈ N, ∀A ∈ RdA×dM , ∀τ ∈ ΘdM , with Det
(
A B(τ ) AT )
)
6= 0,
with G(τ ) and B(τ ) as in Definition 3.1. Hence WA = {W (q) : q ∈ CA}. The
matrices W (q) will be called the Barankin covariance lower bound matrices for
Problem 2.3.
Let S(B0) be the linear span of B0, i.e. S(B0) = {u ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) : u =∑dM
i=1 ai πi w.p. 1, ∀dM ∈ N,∀ ai ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dM , ∀ πi ∈ B0 for 1 ≤ i ≤
dM}.
The following theorem gives the first half of the Barankin vector bound.
Theorem 3.1. If for Problem 2.3 there exists a finite covariance at θT unbiased
estimator ψ(X ) ∈ Ug for g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, then, see Definition 3.1,
CovθT (ψ) ≥ G(τ )AT
(
AB(τ )AT
)−1
AGT (τ ) ∀q ∈ CA (3.1)
i.e. (3.1) is true for the set of conditions CA: ∀ dM ∈ N, ∀dA ∈ N, ∀ A ∈
RdA×dM , ∀ τ ∈ ΘdM , with Det
(
A B(τ ) AT
)
6= 0. There is equality in (3.1) for
some ψ∗ ∈ Ug and some q∗ = (d∗M , d∗A, A∗, τ ∗), q∗ ∈ CA, if and only if there
exists a matrix Λ∗ ∈ RdP×dA such that ϕ∗ = ψ∗ − g(θT ) = Λ∗ A∗ β(τ ∗) w.p. 1,
if and only if each component [ϕ∗]i is a linear combination of elements in B0
w.p. 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP , i.e. ϕ∗ = ψ∗ − g(θT ) ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
, see Definition 3.2.
Proof. The proof will follow from Lemma 3.1. Let ψ ∈ Ug be an arbitrary
finite covariance at θT unbiased estimator for Problem 2.3. Take an arbitrary
dM ∈ N, and an arbitrary τ ∈ ΘdM , see Definition 3.1. Since ψ is unbiased, see
(2.1),

then, G(τ ) = EθT

ϕ βT (τ )
]

(ψ − g(θT )) βT (τ )

, see Definition 3.1, and
this is true for any unbiased estimator ψ ∈ Ug. Additionally, we have,∫
A β(τ ) βT (τ ) AT dPθT = A B(τ ) AT , see Definition 3.1. Take an arbitrary
dA ∈ N and a matrix A ∈ RdA×dM such that Det(A B(τ )AT ) 6= 0 otherwise arbi-
trary. Then the result follows from Lemma 3.1 with γ = ϕ, ρ = β(τ ), F = G(τ ),
and B = B(τ ). The first if and only if equality condition follows directly from
Lemma 3.1. As for the second equality condition, if there is equality in (3.1)
for some ψ∗ ∈ Ug and some q∗ = (d∗M , d∗A, A∗, τ ∗) ∈ CA, then from Lemma 3.1,
there exists Λ∗ ∈ RdP×d∗A such that ϕ∗ = ψ∗ − g(θT ) = Λ∗ A∗ β(τ ∗) w.p. 1.
Since β(τ ∗) ∈ Bd
∗
M
0 , then each component [ϕ
∗]i is a linear combination w.p. 1 of
elements in B0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP , i.e. ϕ∗ = ψ∗ − g(θT ) ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
. Conversely,
suppose thatψ∗ ∈ Ug, withϕ∗ = ψ∗−g(θT ), and that each component [ϕ∗]i is a
linear combination w.p. 1 of elements in B0, i.e. ϕ
∗ = ψ∗−g(θT ) ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
.
Since each [ϕ∗]i ∈ S(B0) w.p. 1, then, there exist Mi ∈ N, ai ∈ RMi ,
and τ i ∈ ΘMi , such that [ϕ∗]i = aTi β(τ i) w.p. 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ dP . Define
Mα =
∑dP
i=1Mi, and τ

α =

τ T1 , τ

, τ α ∈ ΘMα . Call βα = β(τ α),
βα ∈ B0Mα . Define the real matrix Aα ∈ RdP×Mα , as the block-diagonal ma-
trix Aα = Diag
(
aT1 ,a
T
2 , . . . ,a
T
dP
)
, where each block aTi is of dimension 1× Mi,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ Mi, so that ϕ∗ = Aα βα. Starting with the second component of
βα, see Observation 2.3, delete the i-th component if it is a linear combination
w.p. 1 of the previous components. There will remain Mγ ∈ N elements, with
1 ≤ Mγ ≤ Mα, see Observation 2.3. Call τ γ ∈ ΘMγ the non-deleted indexes of
the previous elimination procedure. Call βγ = β(τ γ), βγ ∈ B
Mγ
0 , so that the
components of βγ are linearly independent w.p. 1. Then, there exists a real ma-
trix Aγ ∈ RMα×Mγ such that βα = Aγ βγ w.p. 1, and then ϕ∗ = Aα Aγ βγ w.p.
1. Define the quad-tuple qγ = (Mγ ,Mγ , Iγ , τ γ), where Iγ is the identity matrix
of dimensions Mγ × Mγ . Call Bγ = B(τ γ) = EθT
[
βγ β
T

, Bγ ∈ RMγ×Mγ ,
so that Det(Bγ) 6= 0. If not, there would exist α ∈ RMγ , with α 6= 0,
such that αTBγα = 0, but α
TBγα = α

=
∥∥αTβγ∥∥L2 , and then it would be ∥∥αTβγ∥∥L2 = 0, which is a con-
tradiction since the components of βγ are linearly independent w.p. 1. Hence,
Det(IγBγI
T
γ ) = Det(Bγ) 6= 0, so that qγ ∈ CA. Since G(τ γ) = EθT

The converse of this theorem, is given in Theorem 7.3, see Section 7.3.
Observation 3.1. The previous proof shows that if ψ ∈ Ug is a finite covariance
unbiased estimator for Problem 2.3, then G(τ ) =

h(θ1),h(θ2), · · · ,h(θdM )
)
=
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 10
EθT
[
ϕ βT (τ )

, so that the value of
EθT
[
ϕ βT (τ )
]
is independent of the estimator ψ ∈ Ug as a consequence of the
unbiasedness of ψ, see (2.1).
Observation 3.2. Theorem 3.1 shows that any other finite covariance at θT un-
biased estimator will satisfy (3.1). Then, the covariance matrix of any unbiased
estimator in Ug is comparable, in the Löwner partial order, with any of the
matrices in WA. Hence:
CovθT (ψ) ≥W ∀ ψ ∈ Ug and ∀W ∈ WA
with equality if and only if ϕ = ψ−g(θT ) ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
. The covariance matrices
of estimators in Ug need not be comparable between them, as well as, Barankin
bound matrices in WA need not be comparable between them.
4 Functional analysis setup
4.1 Definition of the operator LB0 : B0 → RdP
From Hypothesis 2.3 we have B0 ⊆ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ). The subset B0 is not
a linear subspace, since any π ∈ B0, is a Radon-Nykodim derivative of a p.m.
with respect to the p.m. PθT , then π ≥ 0 w.p. 1, [15], p. 315, with ‖π‖L2 6= 0,
see Observation 2.3, so that −π cannot belong to B0.
Let u0 be an arbitrary element in B0. To this particular element u0 ∈ B0
corresponds a unique θ0 ∈ Θ, such that u0 ≡ π(θ0), see Hypothesis 2.2, so that
θ0 = π
−1(u0), and, to this index θ0 corresponds a unique well defined value
h(θ0) = g(θ0)− g(θT ) ∈ RdP . Hence, to u0 ∈ B0 corresponds a unique element
h
(
π−1(u0)
)
∈ RdP which we define as LB0
(
u0
)
, so that LB0(u0) = h
(
π−1(u0)
)
.
Hence,
LB0(π(θ)) = h(θ) ∀θ ∈ Θ (4.1)
equivalently LB0(u) = h
(
π−1(u)
)
, for all u ∈ B0. Note that LB0(π(θT )) =
h(θT ) = 0. Then, we may establish a direct relation from B0 to RdP , as an
operator LB0 from B0 to RdP , i.e. LB0 : B0 → RdP . This operator is not
(without additional conditions) necessarily linear nor bounded. The operator
LB0 is completely defined by the collection of Radon-Nykodim derivatives in
B0, i.e. the elements π(θ) ∈ B0, for all θ ∈ Θ, and the vectors g(θ) ∈ RdP ,
for all θ ∈ Θ, and does not depend on the existence or not of any unbiased
estimator, and if it exists, on whether it has finite covariance at θT or not.
4.2 Barankin formulation
The key observation made by Barankin, [2], for dP = 1, where he considers B0 ⊆
Lr(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), r ≥ 1, is that if we are able to find an integral representation
of the operator LB0 , then the problem is solved.
In Barankin, [2], the answer is given by the Riesz Representation Theorem
which finds an element in the conjugate space φ0 ∈ Ls(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), with
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 11
1/s + 1/r = 1, such that LB0(u) =
∫
φ0 u dPθT , ∀u ∈ B0, with minimum
s-norm, i.e. minimum s-th variance. In our case, we generalize to vector es-
timates, i.e. dP > 1, but we will only consider the case s = r = 2 which is
the traditional variance and covariance matrices case, which is the most impor-
tant in applications. To solve the problem the idea is to generalize the Riesz
representation theorem to the vector case. The Riesz representation theorem
requires that the represented functional be defined from a linear space to the
reals. Since B0 is not a linear subspace, Barankin, see [1], pp. 479-480, extends
the operator LB0 to a linear operator over the whole space, using indirectly
the Hahn-Banach theorem, invoking a condition first used by Riesz and gener-
alized by Helly as exposed in [1] footnote in p. 56, see also [18]. In the next
sub-section we generalize the Helly-Riesz-Banach condition to handle the vector
case. In Section 5 we generalize the Riesz representation theorem to the vector
case without requiring the Hahn-Banach theorem, and in Section 6 we apply
these results to solve Problem 2.3.
4.3 Vector generalized Barankin hypothesis: Helly, Riesz,
Banach,Barankin (HRBB)
The following is the generalization of the hypothesis in [2], pp. 480 and 483–484,
see also [1], Theorems 4 and 5 pp. 55–57. This condition will be called here the
HRBB condition for Helly, Riesz, Banach, Barankin. For u ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ),
define the semi-norm ‖u‖L2 =
(∫
u2 dPθT
)1/2
, and call ‖x‖RdP the standard Eu-
clidean norm for x ∈ RdP .
Definition 4.1. (HRBB condition) The functions h(θ) = g(θ)− g(θT ), h(θ) ∈
RdP , and π(θ) ∈ B0, ∀θ ∈ Θ, satisfying the Hypothesis 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, for
Problem 2.3, satisfy the HRBB condition iff: ∃KH ∈ R+, i.e. KH ≥ 0, such
that: ∥∥∥∥∥
dM∑
i=1

∥∥∥∥∥

L2
(4.2)
for all dM ∈ N, for all ai ∈ R, i = 1, 2, · · · , dM , for all θi ∈ Θ, i = 1, 2, · · · , dM .
5 Generalized Riesz representation theorem
Here a generalization is given of the Riesz Representation Theorem for Hilbert
spaces real functionals, see e.g. [3] p. 112, to operators from an arbitrary Hilbert
space H , separable or not, to the real finite dimensional vector space RdP , with
dP ≥ 1. The proof given here does not require the Hahn-Banach extension
theorem, and then, the non-denumerable Axiom of Choice is not required, or
some less stringent variant, [18]. The bound proposed in Helly’s theorem, [1]
pp. 55–56, is generalized, and will be called the operator OP-HRBB (Helly,
Riesz, Banach, Barankin) condition.
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 12
5.1 The Theorem.
Let H denote an arbitrary Hilbert space with semi-inner product 〈u, v〉H ,
∀u, v ∈ H , and semi-norm ‖u‖H = 〈u, u〉
1/2
H . If ‖u‖H = 0, then we say that
u = 0 in semi-norm, (i.s.n.). Equivalently u = 0 i.s.n. iff ‖u‖H = 0. Define
u = v i.s.n., iff ‖u− v‖H = 0.
Theorem 5.1. Let H be an arbitrary Hilbert space. Let B0 be a non-empty
arbitrary subset of H , B0 6= ∅, B0 ⊆ H . Let LB0 be an operator from B0 to
RdP , LB0 : B0 → RdP , such that there exists at least one u0 ∈ B0 for which
LB0(u0) 6= 0. Assume that the operator LB0 satisfies the following condition,
that will be called the operator HRBB condition (OP-HRBB): ∃KH ∈ R+, i.e.
KH ≥ 0, such that:
‖
dM∑
i=1
ai LB0(ui) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖
dM∑
i=1
ai ui ‖H (5.1)
for all dM ∈ N, for all ai ∈ R, i = 1, 2, · · · , dM , for all ui ∈ B0, i =
1, 2, · · · , dM .
Call C(B0) ⊆ H the minimal closed linear space containing B0, i.e. the
closed linear span of B0, [11] p. 11. Then:
1. The operator LB0 may be extended to a bounded linear operator LC from
C(B0) to RdP , LC : C(B0)→ RdP , with LC(u) = LB0(u), for all u ∈ B0.
2. The operator LC has the following representation: There exists dL ∈ N,
1 ≤ dL ≤ dP , and there exist orthonormal ûi’s, ûi ∈ C(B0), for 1 ≤ i ≤
dL, such that:
LC(u) =
dL∑
i=1
〈u, ûi〉H LC(ûi) ∀u ∈ C(B0) (5.2)
Observation 5.1. The standard Riesz representation theorem, corresponds to
B0 = S(B0) = C(B0) = H , and dP = 1. In that case the operator LB0 is
taken as a bounded linear operator, so that the OP-HRBB condition is satisfied,
and then the conclusion is given by (5.2) with dL = 1.
5.2 Proof of the generalized Riesz representation theorem
5.2.1 Extension of the operator LB0 to the span of B0, LS : S(B0)→
RdP
This extension follows the exposition of Banach in [1] pp. 55–56. Assume
the OP-HRBB condition is true. Call S(B0) the linear span i.s.n. of B0, i.e.
S(B0) = {u ∈ H : u =
∑dM
i=1 ai πi i.s.n., ∀dM ∈ N,∀ ai ∈ R, for 1 ≤ i ≤
dM , ∀ πi ∈ B0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dM}. The span S(B0) is called [B0] in [2] p.
495. Clearly, S(B0) is a linear space. With the help of the OP-HRBB condition
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 13
extend the operator LB0 : B0 → RdP to an operator LS : S(B0) → RdP by
the following procedure: for each u ∈ S(B0) there exist, dependent on each
u, dM ∈ N, ai’s ∈ R, 1 ≤ i ≤ dM , πi’s ∈ B0, 1 ≤ i ≤ dM , such that u =∑dM
i=1 ai πi i.s.n. Define LS(u) for u ∈ S(B0) as LS(u) =
∑dM
i=1 ai LB0(πi). This
procedure gives a well defined value for LS(u), since for any other decomposition
of u =
∑d′M
j=1 a
′
j π
′
j i.s.n., resulting in L
′
S(u) =
∑d′M
j=1 a
′
jLB0(π
′
j), because of the
OP-HRBB condition we will have:
‖ LS(u)− L′S(u) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖
dM∑
i=1
aiπi −
d′M∑
j=1
a′jπ

j ‖H = 0
so that
∑dM
i=1 ai LB0(πi) =
∑d′M
j=1 a
′
j LB0(π
′
j). The important result here is
that now S(B0), unlike B0, is a linear space, and that LS : S(B0) → RdP is
a bounded linear operator with bound KH , i.e. ‖ LS(u) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖ u ‖H ,
∀u ∈ S(B0), and LS(u) = LB0(u), ∀u ∈ B0.
Observation 5.2. Barankin, [2] pp. 480 and 483–484, following [1] Theorems
2 and 4, p. 55, invokes the Hahn-Banach theorem, see e.g. [11] p. 78 or [1]
Theorem 1 p. 27, to extend the operator LS to the whole space. The Hahn-
Banach theorem requires the Axiom of Choice or some slightly less stringent
condition, see e.g. [18]. In [1] arbitrary Banach spaces are considered. The
fact that here we work with Hilbert spaces, permits us to avoid the use of the
Hahn-Banach theorem, and then, the non-denumerable Axiom of Choice is not
required.
5.2.2 Extension of the operator LS to the closure of the span of B0,
LC : C(B0)→ RdP
Define the closure of the span of B0 as C(B0) = Closure(S(B0)), i.e. C(B0) =
{u ∈H : ∃ (un)n∈N with un ∈ S(B0) ∀n ∈ N, such that ‖ un − u ‖H → 0}. It
is readily checked that C(B0) is a closed linear subspace of H . The set C(B0)
is called {B0} in [2], p. 494. Extend the operator LS : S(B0)→ RdP to an op-
erator LC : C(B0)→ RdP by continuity: Let u ∈ C(B0), then there exists a se-
quence (un)n∈N of elements un ∈ S(B0) such that ‖ un − u ‖H→ 0. Hence this
sequence is a Cauchy fundamental sequence, i.e. for each  > 0 there exists N()
such that ∀ n,m ≥ N() we have ‖ un−um ‖H < . But since LS is a bounded
linear operator, then ‖ LS(un)−LS(um) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖ un − um ‖H < KH .
Then, (LS(un))n∈N is a Cauchy fundamental sequence in the complete finite di-
mensional vector space RdP , [3] p. 23, hence there exists a limit in RdP . Call that
limit LC(u), so that ‖ LS(un)−LC(u) ‖RdP→ 0, and then LS(un)−LC(u)→ 0
component by component (c.b.c.), i.e. [LS(un)]i − [LC(u)]i → 0, for 1 ≤
i ≤ dP . The value LC(u) is well defined: assume that for some other se-
quence (u′j)j∈N of elements u
′
j ∈ S(B0) with ‖ u′j − u ‖H → 0, we ob-
tain using the previous procedure a limit L′C(u) for the sequence
(
LS(u
′
j)
)
j∈N,
i.e. ‖ LS(u′j) − L′C(u) ‖RdP→ 0. We have: ‖ LS(u′j) − LS(un) ‖RdP =
‖ LS(u′j − un) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖ u′j − un ‖H = KH ‖ u′j − u − (un − u) ‖H
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 14
≤ KH (‖ u′j−u ‖H + ‖ un−u ‖H ). Then, ‖ LC(u)−L′C(u) ‖RdP = ‖ LC(u)−
LS(un) − (L′C(u) − LS(u′j)) −(LS(u′j)− LS(un)) ‖RdP ≤
‖ LC(u) − LS(un) ‖RdP + ‖ L′C(u)− LS(u′j) ‖RdP + KH
(
‖ u′j − u ‖H +
‖ un − u ‖H
)
, so that taking the limits n → ∞, and j → ∞, we obtain
LC(u) = L
′
C(u), so that the value LC(u) ∈ RdP is independent of the cho-
sen sequence. Hence LC(u) is a well defined operator from the closed lin-
ear subspace C(B0) ⊆ H to RdP . It is immediate to show that this op-
erator is linear and that LC(u) = LS(u), ∀u ∈ S(B0), and then LC(u) =
LS(u) = LB0(u), ∀u ∈ B0. Finally, let’s show that the operator LC is bounded
with bound KH . Let u ∈ C(B0), and (un)n∈N a sequence of elements un ∈
S(B0) such that ‖ u − un ‖H→ 0, and then ‖LC(u)− LS(un)‖RdP → 0.
Since
∣∣ ‖u‖H − ‖un‖H ∣∣ ≤ ‖u− un‖H , then ‖un‖H → ‖u‖H . Hence,
‖LC(u)‖RdP = ‖LC(u)− LS(un) + LS(un)‖RdP ≤ ‖LC(u)− LS(un)‖RdP +
‖LS(un)‖RdP ≤ ‖LC(u)− LS(un)‖RdP + KH ‖un‖H . Taking the limit
n → ∞, we obtain ‖ LC(u) ‖RdP ≤ KH ‖ u ‖H . Hence LC(u) is a bounded
linear operator from C(B0) to RdP , such that LC(u) = LS(u), ∀u ∈ S(B0), and
LC(u) = LS(u) = LB0(u), ∀u ∈ B0
5.2.3 Null space NL and topological complement N ⊥L of the operator
LC : C(B0)→ RdP
Define the kernel or null space of the operator LC as NL = {u ∈ C(B0) :
LC(u) = 0}. It is readily seen that NL is a closed linear subspace of C(B0),
NL ⊆ C(B0) ⊆H . The orthogonal complement of NL with respect to C(B0)
is N ⊥L = {u ∈ C(B0) : 〈u,w〉H = 0 ∀w ∈ NL}. Note that the orthogonal
complement of N ⊥L with respect to C(B0) is NL. It is readily shown that N
⊥
L
is a closed linear subspace of C(B0), N ⊥L ⊆ C(B0) ⊆H . Next, let’s show that
C(B0) = N ⊥L ⊕NL, i.e. for each u ∈ C(B0) there exist unique elements i.s.n.
v ∈ N ⊥L and w ∈ NL, such that u = v + w i.s.n. We have:
Fact 1, (Minimum Distance to a Convex Set, [11] p. 8) Let u ∈ C(B0),
since NL is a closed convex subset of the complete Hilbert vector space H ,
there exists a w(u) ∈ NL, such that ‖ u − w(u) ‖H ≤ ‖ u − z ‖H , ∀z ∈ NL,
and that element is unique i.s.n., i.e. if there exists another w′(u) ∈ NL such
that ‖ u− w′(u) ‖H ≤ ‖ u− z ‖H , ∀z ∈ NL, then ‖ w(u)− w′(u) ‖H = 0.
Fact 2, (Principle of Orthogonality, [11] p. 9) Define v(u) = u − w(u),
then v(u) is orthogonal to each of the elements in NL, so that v(u) ∈ N ⊥L .
Additionally, if Fact 2 is true then Fact 1 is true. The element w(u) is defined
as the orthogonal projection of u on the closed subspace NL denoted as w(u) =
Proj(u | NL), similarly v(u) = Proj(u | N ⊥L ).
Hence u ∈ C(B0) may be decomposed as u = v(u) + w(u) i.s.n. with
v(u) ∈ N ⊥L and w(u) ∈ NL. This decomposition is unique i.s.n.: if we also
may write u = v′(u) + w′(u) i.s.n., with v′(u) ∈ N ⊥L and w′(u) ∈ NL, then
v(u)−v′(u) = w′(u)−w(u) i.s.n. with v(u)−v′(u) ∈ N ⊥L and w′(u)−w(u) ∈ NL
by linearity. Then, ‖ v(u) − v′(u) ‖2H = 〈v(u)− v′(u), v(u)− v′(u)〉H =
〈v(u)− v′(u), w′(u)− w(u)〉H = 0. Similarly ‖ w(u) − w′(u) ‖2H = 0. Hence

5.2.4 Images of B0, S(B0), C(B0) and N ⊥L
The previous properties are valid if we replace the space RdP with an arbitrary
Banach space. The following properties depend strongly on the finite dimen-
sional character of RdP . The main property is that N ⊥L is a finite dimensional
sub-space of H as shown below.
Call I[B0] the image of the operator LB0 : B0 → RdP , then, I[B0] ⊆
RdP . Since RdP has dimension dP then any dP + 1 vectors in RdP are linearly
dependent, and there are dP linearly independent vectors that constitute a basis
for RdP , see e.g. [5] pp. 178-179. Since I[B0] ⊆ RdP then any dP + 1 vectors
in I[B0] are linearly dependent. Since by hypothesis there exists at least one
u0 ∈ B0 such that LB0(u0) 6= 0, then there exists dL ∈ N with 1 ≤ dL ≤ dP ,
such that any dL + 1 vectors in I[B0] are linearly dependent, and there are
dL linearly independent vectors LB0(π̂1), LB0(π̂2), · · · , LB0(π̂dL) that belong
to I[B0] with π̂i ∈ B0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. Note that I[B0] is not necessarily a
linear subspace.
The elements π̂i ∈ B0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, are linearly independent i.s.n.,
i.e. whenever there are real coefficients ai ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, for which we
have ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai π̂i ‖H = 0, then ai = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. If not, there would
exist ai’s, ai ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, not all null, such that ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai π̂i ‖H =
0, but then, because of the OP-HRBB condition ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai LB0(π̂i) ‖RdP ≤
KH‖
∑dL
i=1 ai π̂i ‖H , see (5.1), it would be ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai LB0(π̂i) ‖RdP = 0, iff∑dL
i=1 ai LB0(π̂i) = 0, but the LB0(π̂i)’s are l.i., so that it should be ai = 0,
1 ≤ i ≤ dL, which is a contradiction.
Next, decompose each π̂i as in the previous item 5.2.3, i.e. for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL,
π̂i = v̂i + ŵi i.s.n., where v̂i = Proj(π̂i | N ⊥L ) and
ŵi = Proj(π̂i | NL), so that v̂i ∈ N ⊥L ⊆ C(B0) and ŵi ∈ NL ⊆ C(B0). Note
that, even though π̂i ∈ B0, and then π̂i ∈ S(B0), in general it may happen
that v̂i /∈ S(B0) and ŵi /∈ S(B0). Since, see item 5.2.2, LB0(π̂i) = LC(π̂i) =
LC(v̂i + ŵi) = LC(v̂i) + LC(ŵi) = LC(v̂i), then the vectors LC(v̂i)’s are lin-
early independent. Hence, the elements v̂i’s are linearly independent i.s.n.: if
not, there would exist ai’s, ai ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, not all null, such that
‖
∑dL
i=1 ai v̂i ‖H = 0. Then, since the extension LC is a bounded linear opera-
tor, see item 5.2.2, then ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai LC(v̂i) ‖RdP ≤ KH‖
∑dL
i=1 ai v̂i ‖H , so that it
would be ‖
∑dL
i=1 ai LC(v̂i) ‖RdP = 0, iff
∑dL
i=1 ai LC(v̂i) = 0. But the LC(v̂i)’s
are l.i., so that it should be ai = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, which is a contradiction.
Since the v̂i’s are linearly independent i.s.n., and they all belong to N ⊥L ,
use the Gram-Schmidt procedure, see e.g. [5], p. 204, to obtain dL orthonormal
elements ûi ∈ N ⊥L ⊆ C(B0) ⊆ H , that span the same space than the v̂i’s, so
that ‖ûi‖H = 1, 〈ûi, ûj〉H = 0 for i 6= j, and 〈ûi, w〉H = 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL and
∀ w ∈ NL. Hence, each ûi is a linear combination i.s.n. of the v̂i’s, and since
this transformation is invertible, then each v̂i is a linear transformation i.s.n. of
the ûi’s. The vectors LC(ûi) are linearly independent: if not, there would exist
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 16
ai’s, ai ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, not all null, such that
∑dL
i=1 ai LC(ûi) = 0, but
then, LC(
∑dL
i=1 ai ûi) = 0, so that
∑dL
i=1 ai ûi ∈ NL. Then, for 1 ≤ k ≤ dL, we
have
〈
ûk,
∑dL
i=1 ai ûi
〉
H
= 0. But
〈
ûk,
∑dL
i=1 ai ûi
〉
H
=
∑dL
i=1 ai 〈ûk, ûi〉H =
ak‖ûk‖2H = ak, so that ak = 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ dL, which is a contradiction.
Call IL the span of the linearly independent vectors LC(π̂i), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL,
so that I[B0)] ⊆ IL. Since LC(π̂i) = LC(v̂i), then IL is the span of the linearly
independent vectors LC(v̂i), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. Since each v̂i is a linear combi-
nation i.s.n. of the linearly independent i.s.n. elements ûi, then, since LC is a
linear operator, each vector LC(v̂i) is a linear combination of the linearly inde-
pendent vectors LC(ûi) and vice-versa, and then IL is the span of the linearly
independent vectors LC(ûi), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL.
Call I[S(B0)] the image of the operator LS : S(B0) → RdP . Recall that
if u ∈ S(B0) then LS(u) = LC(u). Clearly, IL ⊆ I[S(B0)]. If u ∈ S(B0)
then u is a linear combination i.s.n. of a finite number of elements in B0,
and then the vector LC(u) ∈ I[S(B0)], is the same linear combination of the
corresponding finite number of vectors in I[B0]. But since each vector in I[B0]
is a linear combination of the vectors LC(ûi), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, then LC(u) is a
linear combination of the independent vectors LC(ûi), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, hence
LC(u) ∈ IL, so that I[S(B0)] = IL. If u ∈ S(B0), then since I[S(B0)] = IL,
there exist αi(u) ∈ R, 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, such that LC(u) =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) LC(ûi).
Define w(u) = u −
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi, then LC(w(u)) = 0, so that w(u) ∈ NL and∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi ∈ N ⊥L . Hence u ∈ S(B0) may be written as u =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi+
w(u) i.s.n.
Observation 5.3. Note that, whenever u ∈ C(B0) may be written as u =∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi + w(u), where w(u) ∈ NL and the ûi’s, 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, are or-
thonormal elements in N ⊥L , then we have
‖u‖2H =
dL∑
i=1
|αi(u)|2 + ‖w(u)‖2H (5.3)
Call I[C(B0)] the image of the operator LC : C(B0) → RdP . Since
I[S(B0)] ⊆ I[C(B0)] then IL ⊆ I[C(B0)]. Fix an arbitrary u ∈ C(B0), then
there exists a sequence (un)n∈N of elements un ∈ S(B0) such that ‖un−u‖H →
0, and ‖LC(un) − LC(u)‖RdP → 0. Since ‖un − u‖H → 0, then (un)n∈N
is a Cauchy fundamental sequence in H . Since un ∈ S(B0), then, there
exist sequences (αi(un))n∈N, with αi(un) ∈ R for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, ∀n ∈ N,
and a sequence (w(un))n∈N, with w(un) ∈ NL, ∀n ∈ N, such that un =∑dL
i=1 αi(un) ûi + w(un). Since (un)n∈N is a Cauchy fundamental sequence
in H , with un ∈ S(B0) ⊆ C(B0), then, (5.3) shows that the sequences
(αi(un))n∈N for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL are Cauchy fundamental sequences of real numbers,
and the sequence (w(un))n∈N is a Cauchy fundamental sequence of elements
in NL ⊆ C(B0) ⊆ H . Since the reals are complete, there exist real numbers
ai ∈ R for which αi(un)→ ai for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, and, since H is complete and NL
is closed, there exists an element η ∈ NL such that ‖w(un)− η‖H → 0. Define
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 17
u′ =
∑dL
i=1 ai ûi + η, then u
′ ∈ C(B0). Then (5.3) shows that ‖un − u′‖H → 0.
Since ‖u− u′‖H ≤ ‖u− un‖H + ‖un − u′‖H , taking the limit, we obtain
u = u′ i.s.n. Hence for each u ∈ C(B0) we have found real numbers αi(u) ∈ R,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, and an element w(u) ∈ NL such that
u =
dL∑
i=1
αi(u) ûi + w(u) i.s.n. ∀u ∈ C(B0) (5.4)
Then, LC(u) =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) LC(ûi), so that LC(u) ∈ IL, and then I[C(B0)] =
IL. Additionally, since for arbitrary u ∈ C(B0), from (5.4), we have
Proj(u | N ⊥L ) =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi i.s.n., then, u ∈ N ⊥L iff u =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi
i.s.n., and then N ⊥L is a finite dimension subspace, N
⊥
L ⊆ C(B0) ⊆ H , with
dimension dL, even though H might be a non-separable space.
Hence, we have I[NL] = {0}, and I[B0] ⊆ IL = I[S(B0)] = I[C(B0)] =
I[N ⊥L ].
5.2.5 Generalized Riesz representation of the operator LC : C(B0)→
RdP
From (5.4), it is LC(u) =
∑dL
i=1 αi(u) LC(ûi), for all u ∈ C(B0). Since the ûi’s
are orthonormal and perpendicular to w(u), then, 〈u, ûk〉H =〈∑dL
i=1 αi(u) ûi + w(u), ûk
〉
H
= αk(u). Hence
LC(u) =
dL∑
i=1
〈u, ûi〉H LC(ûi) ∀u ∈ C(B0)
see (5.2), which is the vector generalized Riesz representation for the extension
LC of an operator LB0 : B0 → RdP , B0 ⊆ H , satisfying the OP-HRBB
condition.
6 Optimal estimator under the HRBB condition
The space L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) is a Hilbert space, [15] p. 194, with semi-inner
product 〈u1, u2〉H = 〈u1, u2〉L2 =
∫
u1 u2 dPθT , ∀u1, u2 ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ),
semi-norm ‖u‖H = ‖u‖L2 =
(∫
u2 dPθT
)1/2
, and equality in semi-norm (i.s.n.)
given by equality with probability 1 (w.p. 1).
Lemma 6.1. If the HRBB condition holds for Problem 2.3, see Definition 4.1,
then there exists a finite covariance unbiased estimator ψ̂c ∈ Ug.
Proof. Since L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ) is a Hilbert space, then we take the elements
of H as the functions in L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ). Define the operator LB0(u) =
h
(
π−1(u)
)
, for all u ∈ B0, see Section 4.1. Since the HRBB condition holds for
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 18
Problem 2.3, see (4.2), then the OP-HRBB condition holds, see (5.1), and then
we may apply Theorem 5.1. From (5.2) we obtain
LC(u) =
dL∑
i=1
〈u, ûi〉H LC(ûi) =
dL∑
i=1
LC(ûi)
∫
u ûi dPθT (6.1)
=
∫
u
[
dL∑
i=1

]
dPθT ∀u ∈ C(B0)
where the ûi’s are orthonormal, with ûi ∈ N ⊥L ⊆ C(B0), for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. Note
the importance of working with finite dimensions dP and dL, with 1 ≤ dL ≤ dP ,
since this permits exchanging sums and integrals invoking elementary properties
of Lebesgue integrals. Define
ϕ̂c =
dL∑
i=1
ûi LC(ûi) (6.2)
so that LC(u) =
∫
ϕ̂c u dPθT , ∀ u ∈ C(B0).
Since each LC(ûi) is some constant real vector, i.e. LC(ûi) ∈ RdP , for
1 ≤ i ≤ dL, and each ûi ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), then each component of the
vector ϕ̂c is square integrable, i.e. [ϕ̂c]i ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), equivalently ϕ̂c ∈
L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ). Then ϕ̂c is a measurable function from L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT )
to RdP , so that ϕ̂c(X ) =
∑dL
i=1 ûi(X ) LC(ûi) is a random vector, ϕ̂c(X ) :
Ω → RdP , that does not depend on the sub-indexes θ ∈ Θ. Additionally since
ϕ̂c ∈ L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), then ψ̂c = ϕ̂c+g(θT ) has finite covariance as previously
discussed in Section 2.1. Since LC(u) = LB0(u) if u ∈ B0, see Section 5.2.2,
and, for each u ∈ B0 there exists θ ∈ Θ such that u = π(θ), see Hypothesis
2.2, and LB0(π(θ)) = h(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, see (4.1), then, using (6.1) and (6.2),
h(θ) = LB0(π(θ)) = LC(π(θ)) =
∫
ϕ̂c π(θ) dPθT =
∫
ϕ̂c (dPθ/dPθT ) dPθT =∫
ϕ̂c dPθ =
∫
ϕ̂c(X ) dPθ = Eθ [ϕ̂c], ∀θ ∈ Θ, see (2.1). Then, Eθ
[
ψ̂c
]
=∫
ψ̂c dPθ =
∫
ψ̂c(X ) dPθ = g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ. Hence, ψ̂c(X ) is unbiased for all
θ ∈ Θ, and then ψ̂c ∈ Ug.
Definition 6.1. Define the HRBB estimator as ψ̂c = ϕ̂c + g(θT ), where ϕ̂c is
given by (6.2) as discussed in Lemma 6.1, so that ψ̂c ∈ Ug.
Definition 6.2 (Barankin-efficient estimator). A finite covariance unbiased es-
timator ψ̂ ∈ Ug for Problem 2.3, will be called Barankin-efficient, if CovθT (ψ) ≥
CovθT (ψ̂), for all ψ ∈ Ug. Equivalently, ψ̂ is a minimum-covariance unbiased
estimator for Problem 2.3.
Definition 6.3. Let W be a collection of real s.n.n.d. matrices of dimensions
N × N . A s.n.n.d. matrix A ∈ RN×N is an upper (lower) bound for W if
A ≥ W (A ≤ W ), ∀W ∈ W . Define, if it exists, the matrix-supreme (msup) of
the matrices in W , as a real s.n.n.d. matrix A of dimensions N ×N , such that
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 19
A ≥W , ∀W ∈ W , and such that for each  ∈ R+,  > 0, there exists W () ∈ W
such that ‖A −W ()‖F < . The notation will be A = msup
W∈W
W . If A ∈ W ,
then A will be called the matrix-maximum of W .
Define L as the real matrix, L ∈ RdP×dL , with columns [L]i = LC(ûi), for
1 ≤ i ≤ dL, and define ûT = (û1, û2, · · · , ûdL), so that ϕ̂c = L û, see (6.2). Since
the ûi’s are orthonormal in L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), then EθT
[
û ûT
]
= IdL , where IdL
is the identity matrix of dimensions dL×dL. From (6.2), we have: CovθT (ψ̂c) =

that
CovθT (ψ̂c) = L LT =

Theorem 6.1. If the HRBB condition holds for Problem 2.3, see Definition
4.1, then the HRBB estimator ψ̂c, see Definition 6.1, is an unbiased Barankin-
efficient estimator, and CovθT
(
ψ̂c
)
= msup
W∈WA
WA.
Proof. The HRBB estimator ψ̂c is unbiased and has finite covariance as a con-
sequence of Lemma 6.1. To show that it is Barankin-efficient let’s consider the
following two cases.
1) All the ûi’s belong to S(B0). Then, û ∈
(
S(B0)
)dL
. Since ϕ̂c = L û,
then ϕ̂c ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
, and then, see Theorem 3.1 and Observation 3.2, we
have equality in (3.1). More precisely, since each ûi ∈ S(B0), then, there
exist Mi ∈ N, ai ∈ RMi , and τ i ∈ ΘMi , such that ûi = aTi β(τ i) w.p. 1,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. Define M̂ =
∑dL
i=1Mi, and τ̂
T

, τ̂ ∈ ΘM̂ .
Call β̂ = β(τ̂ ), β̂ ∈ B0M̂ , so that β̂

, and
B̂ = EθT

block-diagonal matrix Â = Diag
(
aT1 ,a

2 , . . . ,a
T
dL
)
, where each block aTi is of
dimension 1 × Mi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ Mi, so that û = Â β̂ w.p. 1. Since
the ûi’s are orthonormal in L2(RdS ,BdS ,PθT ), we have EθT
[
û ûT
]
= IdL .
Since EθT

[

[

ÂT = Â B̂ ÂT , then
Â B̂ ÂT = IdL , so that Det

B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 20
WA, and then, see (3.1) and Observation 3.2, W (q̂) = CovθT (ψ̂c) is a matrix-
maximum for the matrices W ∈ WA and a matrix-minimum for the covariances
of any unbiased estimator ψ ∈ Ug, so that ψ̂c is a minimal covariance unbiased
estimator, i.e. the unbiased HRBB estimator ψ̂c is Barankin-efficient.
2) At least for one i∗, 1 ≤ i∗ ≤ dL, we have that ûi∗ belongs to C(B0)
and ûi∗ /∈ S(B0). Since each ûi belongs to C(B0), then there exist sequences

so that ŝ(m) = Â(m) β̂m w.p. 1. Define S(m) = EθT

M̂(m), dL, Â(m), τ̂ (m)
)
, then, see Appendix Lemma A.1,
for m ≥ M0, we have Det
(
Â(m) B̂(m) ÂT (m)
)
6= 0, so that, for m ≥ M0,
q̂(m) ∈ CA, and then W (q̂(m)) ∈ WA. Then, after some algebra, for m ≥ M0
we obtain:
W (q̂(m)) = G(τ̂ (m)) ÂT (m)(
Â(m) B̂(m) ÂT (m)
)−1
Â(m) GT (τ̂ (m))
= L S(m) LT + L EθT

so that, see Appendix Lemma A.1, W (q̂(m)) → L LT = CovθT (ψ̂c), see (6.3),
component by component and then in Frobenius norm.

Unlike the previous case, if for some i∗, 1 ≤ i∗ ≤ dL, we have that ûi∗
belongs to C(B0) and ûi∗ /∈ S(B0), then CovθT (ψ̂c) = L LT /∈ WA. If not,
CovθT (ψ̂c) ∈ WA, and then we have equality in (3.1), so that, see Theorem 3.1,
[ϕ̂c]i ∈ S(B0), for each 1 ≤ i ≤ dL. But ϕ̂c = Lû, so that LT ϕ̂c = LTLû, with
L =
(
LC(û1) · · ·LC(ûdL)
)
. Since the dL columns of L are linearly independent
then Det(LTL) 6= 0, if not there exists α ∈ RdP , α 6= 0, such that LTLα = 0,
so that αTLTLα = ‖Lα‖2RdP = 0, and then Lα = 0, contradiction. Hence
û =
(
LTL
)−1LT ϕ̂c, and then [û]i ∈ S(B0), for each 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, contradiction.
Since ∀ψ ∈ Ug, see Theorem 3.1, it is CovθT (ψ) ≥W (q̂(m)), then CovθT (ψ)−
W (q̂(m)) ≥ 0, so that, taking the limit, see Appendix Lemma A.2, we have
CovθT (ψ) − CovθT (ψ̂c) ≥ 0, and then CovθT (ψ) ≥ CovθT (ψ̂c), ∀ ψ ∈ Ug. Then,
even though CovθT (ψ̂c) /∈ WA, we have CovθT (ψ) ≥ CovθT (ψ̂c), ∀ ψ ∈ Ug,
and, see Theorem 3.1, CovθT (ψ̂c) ≥ W , ∀ W ∈ WA. Furthermore, as previ-
ously shown, there exists a sequence Wm ∈ WA, Wm ≡ W (q̂(m)), such that∥∥∥CovθT (ψ̂c)−Wm∥∥∥
F
→ 0. Hence, though CovθT (ψ̂c) is not a matrix-maximum
for WA, it is a matrix-supreme for WA, and CovθT (ψ̂c) is a matrix-minimum for
all the covariances of the estimators in Ug, so that ψ̂c is Barankin-efficient.
Observation 6.1. A key point in Theorem 6.1 is that if WA is bounded above,
then, the optimal covariance CovθT (ψ̂c) may be obtained as the matrix-supreme,
see Definition 6.3, of the matrices W ∈ WA, see (3.1).
CovθT (ψ̂c) = msup
q∈CA
G(τ ) AT
(
A B(τ ) AT )

and the matrix-supreme will be a matrix-maximum if and only if ψ̂c − g(θT ) =
ϕ̂c ∈
(
S(B0)
)dP
.
7 LMI equivalent formulation
7.1 Equivalence of the LMI bound and the HRBB condi-
tion
The statement that the Barankin covariance lower bounds WA are bounded
above, is a disguised form of the HRBB condition, as a matter of fact the
converse is also true, see Lemma 7.1 and Theorem 7.1 below.
Lemma 7.1. If the Barankin covariance lower bounds WA are bounded above,
i.e. the collection WA is bounded, see Definition 3.2, then the HRBB condition
holds, see Definition 4.1.
Proof. Call BW the bound for WA, i.e.
BW ≥W (q) = G(τ ) AT
(
A B(τ ) AT )
)−1
A GT (τ ) (7.1)
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 22
for all q ∈ CA. Since this is true for matrices A of all sizes dA ∈ N for a given
dM ∈ N, A ∈ RdA×dM , in particular is true when dA = 1, i.e. when A has
one single row. Call aT = (a1, a2, · · · , adM ) the single row, so that A = aT ,
with a ∈ RdM . Then, A B(τ ) AT = aT B(τ ) a = aT EθT
[
β(τ ) βT (τ )
]
a =
EθT
[
aT β(τ ) βT (τ ) a
]
= EθT
[(
aT β(τ )
)2]
= EθT
[(∑dM
i=1 ai π(θi)
)2]
=∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥2
L2
. Observe that aT B(τ ) a is a non-negative scalar, i.e.
aT B(τ ) a ∈ R+, and since we assumed that q ∈ CA then aT B(τ ) a 6= 0,
as a matter of fact aT B(τ ) a =
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥2
L2
> 0. On the other hand,
G(τ ) AT = G(τ ) a =
∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi). Then, (7.1) takes the form
BW ≥
(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)T
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥2
L2
Hence,
Tr [BW ] ≥
Tr
[(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)T]
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥2
L2
Call KH = (Tr [BW ])
1/2
. Since, Tr
[(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)(∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi)
)T]
=∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi)∥∥∥2RdP then, KH ≥ ∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi)∥∥∥RdP / ∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥L2 .
Hence
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi)∥∥∥RdP ≤ KH ∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥L2 , ∀dM ∈ N, ∀ai ∈ R,
1 ≤ i ≤ dM , ∀θi ∈ Θ, 1 ≤ i ≤ dM , such that
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥
L2
6= 0.
If
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥
L2
= 0, then
∑dM
i=1 ai π(θi) = 0 w.p. 1. Take an arbi-
trary u∗ ∈ B0, then, see Observation 2.3, ‖u∗‖L2 6= 0. Call θ
∗ = π−1(u∗).
Then
∑dM
i=1 ai π(θi) + (1/n) u
∗ = (1/n) u∗ w.p. 1, for all n ∈ N, so that∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi) + (1/n) u∗∥∥∥
L2
= ‖(1/n) u∗‖L2 6= 0, for all n ∈ N. Hence
the previously obtained inequality applies,
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 aih(θi) + (1/n)h(θ∗)∥∥∥RdP ≤
KH
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 aiπ(θi) + (1/n)u∗∥∥∥
L2
= KH (1/n) ‖u∗‖L2 , so that∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi) + (1/n) h(θ∗)∥∥∥RdP → 0, as n → +∞. Since∥∥∥∑dMi=1 aih(θi)∥∥∥RdP = ∥∥∥∑dMi=1 aih(θi) + (1/n)h(θ∗)− (1/n) h(θ∗)∥∥∥RdP ≤∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi) + (1/n) h(θ∗)∥∥∥RdP + (1/n) ∥∥h(θ∗)∥∥RdP then, taking the limit
n→ +∞, it results
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi)∥∥∥RdP = 0.
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 23
Hence
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai h(θi)∥∥∥RdP ≤ KH ∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥L2 , ∀dM ∈ N, ∀ai ∈ R,
1 ≤ i ≤ dM , ∀θi ∈ Θ, 1 ≤ i ≤ dM , such that
∥∥∥∑dMi=1 ai π(θi)∥∥∥
L2
≥ 0, as required
by Definition 4.1, so that the HRBB condition holds.
Theorem 7.1. The HRBB condition holds, see Definition 4.1, if and only if
the collection WA is bounded, see Definition 3.2.
Proof. If HRBB holds, see Theorem 6.1, then there exists ψ̂c ∈ Ug such that
ψ̂c is Barankin-efficient, and then CovθT
(
ψ̂c
)
≥ W , ∀ W ∈ WA, so that WA is
bounded. The converse follows as a consequence of Lemma 7.1.
Lemma 7.2. If there exists a finite covariance unbiased estimator ψ(X ) for
g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ for Problem 2.3, then WA is bounded above, see Definition 3.2.
Proof. Since a finite covariance unbiased estimator ψ exists, then (3.1) shows
that WA is bounded.
7.2 Other equivalent LMI bounds
One of the key ideas in Barankin’s paper is the use of the free coefficients ai’s,
see [2] p. 480, that here take the form of the matrices A’s. As discussed in [2],
and here below, the matrices A are not required for the determination of the
optimal matrix bound, but, they are most useful when one needs to compare the
Barankin bound with other bounds, such as Cramer-Rao, Bhattacharyya, etc.
For the scalar case see [2] Corollaries 5–1 p. 487 and 6–1 p. 488. For the vector
Cramer-Rao bound, compare the results here with e.g. [21] and references there.
Definition 7.1. Define the pair d = (dM , τ ), where dM ∈ N, and τ ∈ ΘdM .
Define CB as the collection of all the pairs d with Det
(
B(τ )
)
6= 0, with B(τ ) as
in Definition 3.1, so that
CB =
{
d : ∀ dM ∈ N,∀ τ ∈ ΘdM , with Det
(
B(τ )
)
6= 0
}
Define WB as the collection of matrices
V (d) = G(τ )
(
B(τ )
)−1
GT (τ ) ∀d ∈ CB
with G(τ ) as in Definition 3.1. Equivalently WB =
{
V (d) : d ∈ CB
}
.
Define the function g(θ) as B0-compatible if whenever
∑dM
i=1 ai π(θi) = 0
w.p. 1, we have
∑dM
i=1 ai h(θi) = 0, with dM ∈ N, ai ∈ R, θi ∈ Θ, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dM .
Note that if g(θ) is not B0-compatible then no unbiased estimator exists for
g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, for Problems 2.1, 2.2 or 2.3. If g(θ) is B0-compatible, then for
τ ∈ ΘdM and a ∈ RdM , if aT β(τ ) = 0, then G(τ ) a = 0, and for A ∈ RdA×dM , if
A β(τ ) = 0, then G(τ )AT = 0. Hence, if τ 1 ∈ ΘdA and we have A β(τ ) = β(τ 1),
then G(τ )AT = G(τ 1).
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 24
Theorem 7.2. The collection WA, see Definition 3.2, is bounded above, if and
only if the collection WB is bounded above and g(θ) is B0-compatible.
Proof. Assume WA is bounded. Then, there exists a s.n.n.d. matrix B1 ∈
RdP×dP , such that B1 ≥ W (q), ∀q ∈ CA. Take an arbitrary d′ ∈ CB , with
d′ =
(
d′M , τ
′), so that Det(B(τ ′)) 6= 0. Define q′ = (d′M , d′M , Id′M , τ ′), where
Id′M is the identity matrix of dimensions d
′
M × d′M . Since Det
(
Id′MB(τ
′)ITd′M
)
=
Det
(
B(τ ′)
)
6= 0, then q′ ∈ CA, and we have W (q′) = V (d′), so that B1 ≥ V (d′),
∀d′ ∈ CB , and then WB is bounded. Since WA is bounded, then the HRBB con-
dition holds, see Lemma 7.1, and then (4.2) shows that g(θ) is B0-compatible.
Conversely, assume WB is bounded. Then, there exists a s.n.n.d. matrix
B2 ∈ RdP×dP , such that B2 ≥ V (d), ∀d ∈ CB . Take an arbitrary q′ ∈ CA, with
q′ =
(
d′M , d
′
A, A
′, τ ′
)
, with A′ ∈ Rd′A×d′M , so that Det
(
A′ B(τ ′) (A′)
T ) 6= 0. As
in the proof of the last part of Theorem 3.1, obtain d?τ ∈ N, 1 ≤ d?τ ≤ d′M ,
A? ∈ Rd′M×d?τ , and τ ? ∈ Θd?τ , by elimination of the components of the vector
β(τ ′) which are linear combinations w.p. 1 of previous components, so that
β(τ ′) = A? β(τ ?), with Det
(
B(τ ?)
)
= Det
(
EθT
[
β(τ ?) βT (τ ?)
])
6= 0.
Then, B(τ ′) = EθT
[
β(τ ′) βT (τ ′)
]
= A? EθT
[
β(τ ?) βT (τ ?)
]
(A?)
T
=
A? B(τ ?) (A?)
T
. Since g(θ) is B0-compatible, then G(τ
′) = G(τ ?) (A?)
T
.
Hence,
W (q′) = G(τ ′) (A′)
T (
A′ B(τ ′) (A′)
T
)
)−1
A′ G(τ ′)
= G(τ ?) (A?)
T
(A′)
T (
A′A?B(τ ?) (A?)
T
(A′)
T )−1
A′ A? GT (τ ?)
Define d? =
(
d?τ , τ
?
)
so that V (d?) = G(τ ?)B−1(τ ?)GT (τ ?). Then, the Ap-
pendix Lemma A.4 shows that V (d?) ≥ W (q′), so that B2 ≥ V (d?) ≥ W (q′).
Hence B2 ≥W (q′), for all q′ ∈ CA, so that WA is bounded.
For an arbitrary symmetric matrix W call λM (W ) ∈ R its greatest eigen-
value. The operator norm ‖A‖op of a matrix A ∈ RN×M is its greatest singular
value, [4] p. 12, i.e. the non-negative square root of the greatest eigenvalue
of the matrix ATA, so that ‖A‖op =
(
λM (A
TA)
)1/2
. For s.n.n.d. matrices
singular values and eigenvalues coincide, [23] p. 19, so that if W ∈ W , then
‖W‖op = λM (W ). Define a k-identity matrix as a matrix of the form K IM
where K ∈ R and IM is the identity matrix of dimensions M ×M . Then, we
have
Lemma 7.3. If X is a s.n.n.d. matrix, X ∈ RM×M , then, for K ∈ R, we have
K IM ≥ X if and only if K ≥ λM (X).
Proof. Since X is symmetric, then it is diagonalizable, so that there exist an
orthogonal matrix Q ∈ RM×M , and a diagonal matrix Λ ∈ RM×M , such
that X = Q Λ QT . Then, since λM (X) IM ≥ Λ, we have λM (X) IM =
Q λM (X) IM Q
T ≥ Q Λ QT = X. Hence, if K ≥ λM (X), then K IM ≥
λM (X) IM ≥ X. Conversely if K IM ≥ X, then K IM ≥ Q Λ QT , so that
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 25
QTK IMQ ≥ Λ, and since QTK IM Q = K IM , then K IM ≥ Λ. Hence
K ≥ λM (X).
Lemma 7.4. A non-empty collection W of s.n.n.d. matrices W ∈ RM×M is
upper bounded if and only if there exists KW ∈ R, such that KW IM ≥ W ,
∀W ∈ W .
Proof. If there exists KW ∈ R, such that KW IM ≥ W , ∀W ∈ W , then by
definition KW IM is a matrix bound for W , and then W is bounded. Conversely,
assume W is bounded. Then there exists BW ∈ RM×M s.n.n.d., such that BW ≥
W , ∀W ∈ W . Since BW is symmetric, then there exists the real maximum
eigenvalue λM (BW ) ∈ R. Take KW ∈ R such that KW ≥ λM (BW ). Then, from
Lemma 7.3, KW IM ≥ BW ≥W , ∀W ∈ W .
7.3 Main Theorem
Collecting all the previous results, we have
Theorem 7.3 (Main Theorem). The following statements for Problem 2.3 are
equivalent, meaning that if any one of them is true, then they are all true:
1. A finite covariance vector unbiased estimator exists, i.e. Ug is not empty.
2. A Barankin-efficient vector unbiased estimator exists.
3. The HRBB condition holds.
4. The collection WA is bounded.
5. There exists K ∈ R+ such that K IdP ≥W , ∀W ∈ WA.
6. The collection WB is bounded, and g(θ) is B0-compatible.
7. There exists K ∈ R+ such that K IdP ≥ W , ∀W ∈ WB, and g(θ) is
B0-compatible.
Proof. 3) ⇒ 2) ⇒ 1) follows from Theorem 6.1, 3) ⇔ 4) from Theorem 7.1, 1)
⇒ 4) from Lemma 7.2, 4) ⇔ 5) and 6) ⇔ 7) from Lemma 7.4, finally 4) ⇔ 6)
follows from Theorem 7.2.
Corollary 7.3.1. As a corollary, the collection Ug is empty iff WA is not
bounded, i.e. for each k ∈ N there exists W ?k ∈ WA such that ‖W ?k ‖F ≥
‖W ?k ‖op = λM (W
?
k ) > k, so that limk→+∞ ‖W ?k ‖F = +∞. Note that Ug is
empty either because there are no unbiased estimators for g(θ), ∀θ ∈ Θ, or if
there exist, they don’t have finite finite covariance matrix at θT , see Definition
3.2.

A APPENDIX
Lemma A.1. Let H be an arbitrary Hilbert space. Let the elements ui ∈ H ,
for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL < +∞, be orthonormal so that ‖ui‖L2 = 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, and
〈ui, uj〉H = 0, for i 6= j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL, and then 〈ui, uj〉H = δi,j. Assume that
for each ui, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, there exist sequences
(
si(m)
)
m∈N, with si(m) ∈H ,
∀m ∈ N, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL, such that lim
m→∞
‖ui − si(m)‖H = 0, for 1 ≤ i ≤ dL.
Define S(m) ∈ RdL×dL , as a matrix with i-th, j-th element
[
S(m)
]
i,j
=
〈si(m), sj(m)〉H , for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL, ∀m ∈ N. Then:
1. ‖S(m)− IdL‖F → 0, as m → ∞, where IdL is the identity matrix of
dimensions dL × dL.
2. Det(S(m))→ 1, and
∥∥S−1(m)− IdL∥∥F → 0, as m→∞.
3. lim
m→∞
〈ui − si(m), sj(m)〉H = 0, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL.
Proof. a) From the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we obtain
∣∣〈ui − si(m), uj〉H ∣∣ ≤
‖ui − si(m)‖H , so that limm→∞ 〈ui − si(m), uj〉H = 0, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL.
b) Also
∣∣〈ui − si(m), uj − sj(m)〉H ∣∣ ≤ ‖ui − si(m)‖H ‖uj − sj(m)‖H , and
then lim
m→∞
〈ui − si(m), uj − sj(m)〉H = 0, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL.
c) We have 〈si(m), sj(m)〉H = 〈si(m)− ui + ui, sj(m)− uj + uj〉H =
〈si(m)− ui, sj(m)− uj〉H + 〈ui, sj(m)− uj〉H + 〈si(m)− ui, uj〉H +
〈ui, uj〉H . Taking the limit, and using a) and b), limm→∞ 〈si(m), sj(m)〉H = δi,j ,
for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL. Then S(m) → IdL component by component, and then
in Frobenius norm. Since the determinant of a matrix is an algebraic sum of a
finite number of products of a finite number of elements of the matrix, see [5] p.
319, then Det (S(m)) → Det(IdL) = 1, so that ∃M0 ∈ N, such that ∀m ≥ M0,
it will be Det (S(m)) ≥ 1/2, and then Det (S(m)) 6= 0. Similarly, since the
elements of the inverse of a matrix are the quotients of algebraic sums of a finite
number of products of a finite number of elements of the matrix divided the
determinant, see [5] p. 325, then S−1(m) has a limit A0 component by compo-
nent, so that S(m) S−1(m)→ IdL A0, but since S(m) S−1(m) = IdL , ∀m ∈ N,
then A0 = IdL , and then S
−1(m)→ IdL component by component as m→∞,
and then in Frobenius norm, or any other matrix norm, so that we have shown
items 1) and 2).
d) We have 〈ui − si(m), sj(m)〉H = 〈ui − si(m), sj(m)− uj + uj〉H =
〈ui − si(m), sj(m)− uj〉H + 〈ui − si(m), uj〉H . Applying a) and b) we ob-
tain lim
m→∞
〈ui − si(m), sj(m)〉H = 0, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ dL, so that we have
shown item 3).
Lemma A.2. Let
(
An
)
n∈N be a sequence of s.n.n.d. matrices An ∈ R
N×N ,
An ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N , such that there exists A ∈ RN×N for which An → A c.b.c and
then in Frobenius norm. Then the matrix A is s.n.n.d.
B. Cernuschi-Fŕıas 27
Proof. Takeα ∈ RN arbitrary, sinceN is finite, then limn→+∞αTAnα = αTAα.
But αTAnα ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N, so that limn→+∞αTAnα ≥ 0, and then αTAα ≥ 0,
∀α ∈ RN .
The following lemma is a LMI weighted form of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequal-
ity for matrices, [8] p. 1093. For convenience, a proof is given here.
Lemma A.3. Let M,N,P ∈ N. Let H ∈ RM×M be an arbitrary real s.p.d.
matrix, and let X ∈ RN×M and Y ∈ RP×M , be otherwise arbitrary real matrices
such that Det(Y HY T ) 6= 0. Then
X H XT ≥ X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1
Y H XT
with equality if and only if there exists Λ ∈ RN×P , such that X = Λ Y , if and
only if
X = X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1
Y
Proof. Let Λ ∈ RN×P . Define T (Λ) = (X − Λ Y ) H (X − Λ Y )T , so that T (Λ)
is s.n.n.d., ∀Λ ∈ RN×P . Define
R(Λ) =
(
Λ−X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1)
Y H Y T
(
Λ−X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1)T
and D = X H XT − X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1
Y H XT . Note that R(Λ) ≥
0, ∀Λ ∈ RN×P . Then T (Λ) = R(Λ) + D ≥ 0, ∀Λ ∈ RN×P . For Λ0 =
X H Y T
(
Y H Y T
)−1
, we have R(Λ0) = 0, so that T (Λ0) = D ≥ 0, and then
the LMI is obtained. If there is equality then D = 0, and then T (Λ) = R(Λ),
∀Λ ∈ RN×P . In particular for Λ0 we have R(Λ0) = 0, and then T (Λ0) = 0.
But, since H is s.p.d. then X = Λ0 Y = X H Y
T
(
Y H Y T
)−1
Y . As for
the converse, if there exists Λ1 such that X = Λ1 Y , then T (Λ1) = 0, since
R(Λ1) ≥ 0 by definition, and D ≥ 0 as previously shown, then, R(Λ1) = 0
and D = 0, because T (Λ1) = R(Λ1) + D. From D = 0 we obtain the equality
in the LMI inequality, and from R(Λ1) = 0, we obtain that Λ1 = Λ0, because
Det
(
Y H Y T
)
6= 0 and then Y H Y T is s.p.d. If X = X H Y T
(
Y H Y T

multiply both sides on the right by H XT , and then the equality for the LMI
is obtained.
The following lemma, cf. [9] Lemma 2.4.1, may be interpreted as a LMI
generalization of the Rayleigh quotient, [12] p. 117.
Lemma A.4. Let M,N,P ∈ N. Let B ∈ RM×M be an arbitrary real s.p.d.

Proof. Since B is s.p.d. then it has a unique s.p.d. square root B1/2, [16] p.
405, and we have Det(B) 6= 0 and Det(B1/2) 6= 0. The result follows from the
previous Lemma A.3 taking, X = G B−1/2, Y = A B1/2, and H as the identity
matrix of dimensions M ×M .
