Abstract
We introduce NoisyNet, a deep reinforcement learning agent with parametric noise
added to its weights, and show that the induced stochasticity of the agent’s policy
can be used to aid efficient exploration. The parameters of the noise are learned
with gradient descent along with the remaining network weights. NoisyNet is
straightforward to implement and adds little computational overhead. We find that
replacing the conventional exploration heuristics for A3C, DQN and dueling agents
(entropy reward and -greedy respectively) with NoisyNet yields substantially
higher scores for a wide range of Atari games, in some cases advancing the agent
from sub to super-human performance.
1 Introduction
Despite the wealth of research into efficient methods for exploration in Reinforcement Learning
(RL) [16, 15], most exploration heuristics rely on random perturbations of the agent’s policy, such
as -greedy [33] or entropy regularisation [37], to induce novel behaviours. However such local
‘dithering’ perturbations are unlikely to lead to the large-scale behavioural patterns needed for efficient
exploration in many environments [24].
Optimism in the face of uncertainty is a common exploration heuristic in reinforcement learning.
Various forms of this heuristic often come with theoretical guarantees on agent performance [2, 17,
15, 1, 16].
However, these methods are often limited to small state-action spaces or to linear function approx-
imations and are not easily applied with more complicated function approximators such as neural
networks. A more structured approach to exploration is to augment the environment’s reward signal
with an additional intrinsic motivation term [32] that explicitly rewards novel discoveries. Many
such terms have been proposed, including learning progress [26], compression progress [30], vari-
ational information maximisation [14] and prediction gain [4]. One problem is that these methods
separate the mechanism of generalisation from that of exploration; the metric for intrinsic reward, and–
importantly–its weighting relative to the environment reward, must be chosen by the experimenter,
rather than learned from interaction with the environment. Without due care, the optimal policy can
be altered or even completely obscured by the intrinsic rewards; furthermore, dithering perturbations
are usually needed as well as intrinsic reward to ensure robust exploration [25]. Exploration in
the policy space itself, for example, with evolutionary or black box algorithms [22, 9, 29], usually
requires many prolonged interactions with the environment. Although these algorithms are quite

generic and can apply to any type of parametric policies (including neural networks), they are usually
not data efficient and require a simulator to allow many policy evaluations.
We propose a simple alternative approach, called NoisyNet, where learned perturbations of the
network weights are used to drive exploration. The key insight is that a single change to the weight
vector can induce a consistent, and potentially very complex, state-dependent change in policy over
multiple timesteps – unlike dithering approaches where decorrelated (and, in the case of -greedy,
state-independent) noise is added to the policy at every step. The perturbations are sampled from a
noise distribution. The variance of the perturbation is a parameter that can be considered as the energy
of the injected noise. These variance parameters are learned using gradients from the reinforcement
learning loss function, along side the other parameters of the agent. The approach differs from
parameter compression schemes such as variational inference [12, 7] and flat minima search [13]
since we do not maintain an explicit distribution over weights during training but simply inject
noise in the parameters and tune its intensity automatically. It also differs from variational inference
[11, 8] or Thompson sampling [35, 19] as the distribution on the parameters of our agents does not
necessarily converge to an approximation of a posterior distribution.
At a high level our algorithm induces a randomised network for exploration, with care this approach
can be provably-efficient with suitable linear value functions [24]. Previous attempts to extend this
approach to deep neural networks required many duplicates of sections of the network [23]. By
contrast our NoisyNet approach requires only one extra parameter per weight and applies to policy
gradient methods such as A3C out of the box [20]. Most recently (and independently of our work),
Plappert et al. [27] presented a similar technique where constant Gaussian noise is added to the
parameters of the network. Our method thus differs by the ability of the network to adapt the noise
injection with time and it is not restricted to Gaussian noise distributions. It can also be adapted to
any deep RL algorithm and we demonstrate this versatility by providing NoisyNet versions of DQN
(value-based) [21] and A3C (policy based) [20] algorithms. Experiments on 57 Atari games show
that they both achieve striking gains when compared to the baseline algorithms without significant
extra computational cost.
2 Background
This section provides mathematical background for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and deep
RL with Q-learning and actor-critic methods.
2.1 Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning
MDPs model stochastic, discrete-time and finite action-state space control problems [5, 6, 28]. An
MDP is a tuple M = (X ,A, R, P, γ) where X is the state space, A the action space, R the reward
function, γ ∈]0, 1[ the discount factor and P a stochastic kernel modelling the one-step Markovian
dynamics (P (y|x, a) is the probability of transitioning to state y by choosing action a in state x). A
stochastic policy π maps each state to a distribution over actions π(·|x) and gives the probability
π(a|x) of choosing action a in state x. The quality of a policy π is assessed by the action-value
function Qπ defined as:
Qπ(x, a) = Eπ
[
+∞∑
t=0
γtR(xt, at)
]
, (1)
where Eπ is the expectation over the distribution of the admissible trajectories (x0, a0, x1, a1, . . . )
obtained by executing the policy π starting from x0 = x and a0 = a. Therefore, the quantityQπ(x, a)
represents the expected γ-discounted cumulative reward collected by executing the policy π starting
from x and a. A policy is optimal if no other policy yields a higher return. The action-value function
of the optimal policy is Q?(x, a) = arg maxπ Qπ(x, a).
The value function V π for a policy is defined as
V π(x) = Ea ∼π(·|x)[Qπ(x, a)], (2)
and represents the expected γ-discounted return collected by executing the policy π starting from
state x.
2
2.2 Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep Reinforcement Learning uses deep neural networks as function approximators for RL methods.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) [21], Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) [20], Trust Region
Policy Optimisation [31] and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient [18] are examples of such algo-
rithms. They frame the RL problem as the minimisation of a loss function L(θ), where θ represents
the parameters of the network. In our experiments we shall consider the DQN and A3C algorithms.
DQN [21] uses a neural network as an approximator for the action-value function of the optimal policy
Q?(x, a). DQN’s estimate of the optimal action-value function, Q(x, a), is found by minimising the
following loss with respect to the neural network parameters θ:
L(θ) = E(x,a,r,y)∼D
[(
r + γmax
b∈A
Q(y, b; θ−)−Q(x, a; θ)
)2]
, (3)
where D is a distribution over transitions e = (x, a, r = R(x, a), y ∼ P (·|x, a)) drawn from a replay
buffer of previously observed transitions. Here θ− represents the parameters of a fixed and separate
target network which is updated (θ− ← θ) regularly to stabilise the learning. An -greedy policy
is used to pick actions greedily according to the action-value function Q or, with probability , a
random action is taken.
In contrast, A3C [20] is a policy gradient algorithm. A3C’s network directly learns a policy π and a
value function V of its policy. The gradient of the loss on the A3C policy at step t for the roll-out
(xt+i, at+i ∼ π(·|xt+i; θ), rt+i)ki=0 is:
∇θLπ(θ) = −Eπ
[
k∑
i=0
∇θ log(π(at+i|xt+i; θ))A(xt+i, at+i; θ) + β
k∑
i=0
∇θH(π(·|xt+i; θ))
]
.
(4)
H[π(·|xt; θ)] denotes the entropy of the policy π and β is a hyperparameter that trades off between op-
timising the advantage function and the entropy of the policy. The advantage functionA(xt+i, at+i; θ)
is the difference between observed returns and estimates of the return produced by A3C’s value
network: A(xt+i, at+i; θ) =
∑k
j=i γ
j−irt+j +γ
k−iV (xt+k; θ)−V (xt+i; θ), rt+j being the reward
at step t+ j and V (x; θ) being the agent’s estimate of value function of state x.
Parameters of the value function are found to match on-policy returns: LV (θ) =
Eπ
[∑k
i=0(Q̂i − V (xt+i; θ))2
]
where Q̂i is the return obtained by executing policy π starting in state
xt+i: Q̂i =
∑k
j=i γ
j−irt+j+γ
k−iV (xt+k; θ). The overall A3C loss is thenL(θ) = Lπ(θ)+λLV (θ)
where λ balances optimising the policy loss relative to the baseline value function loss.
3 NoisyNets for Reinforcement Learning
NoisyNets are neural networks whose weights and biases are perturbed by a parametric function
of the noise. These parameters are adapted with gradient descent. More precisely, let y = fθ(x)
be a neural network parameterised by the vector of noisy parameters θ which takes the input x and
outputs y. We represent the noisy parameters θ as θ def= µ + Σ  ε, where ζ def= (µ,Σ) is a set of
vectors of learnable parameters, ε is a vector of zero-mean noise with fixed statistics and  represents
element-wise multiplication. The usual loss of the neural network is wrapped by expectation over the
noise ε: L̄(ζ) def= E [L(θ)]. Optimisation now occurs with respect to the set of parameters ζ.
Consider a linear layer of a neural network with p inputs and q outputs, represented by
y = wx+ b (5)
where x ∈ Rp is the layer input,w ∈ Rq×p the weight matrix, and b ∈ Rq the bias. The corresponding
noisy linear layer is defined as:
y
def
= (µw + σw  εw)x+ µb + σb  εb, (6)
where µw + σw  εw and µb + σb  εb replace w and b in Eq. (5), respectively. The parameters
µw ∈ Rq×p, µb ∈ Rq, σw ∈ Rq×p and σb ∈ Rq are learnable whereas εw ∈ Rq×p and εb ∈ Rq are
noise random variables (the specific choices of this distribution are described below).
3
We now turn to explicit instances of the noise distributions for linear layers in a noisy network. We
explore two options:
(a) Independent Gaussian noise: the noise applied to each weight and bias is independent, where
each entry εwi,j (respectively each entry ε
b
j) of the random matrix ε
w (respectively of the random
vector εb) is drawn from a unit Gaussian distribution. This means that for each noisy linear layer,
there are pq + q noise variables (for p inputs to the layer and q outputs).
(b) Factorised Gaussian noise reduces the number of random variables in the network from one per
weight, to one per input and one per output of each noisy linear layer. By factorising εwi,j , we can
use p unit Gaussian variables εi for noise of the inputs and and q unit Gaussian variables εj for
noise of the outputs (thus p+ q unit Gaussian variables in total). Each εwi,j and ε
b
j can then be
written as:
εwi,j = f(εi)f(εj) (7)
εbj = f(εj), (8)
where f is a functions. In our experiments we used f(x) = sgn(x)
√
|x|.
Since the loss of a noisy network, L̄(ζ) = E [L(θ)], is an expectation over the noise, the gradients are
straightforward to obtain:
∇L̄(ζ) = ∇E [L(θ)] = E [∇µ,ΣL(µ+ Σ ε)] . (9)
We use a Monte Carlo approximation to the above gradients, taking a single sample ξ at each step of
optimisation:
∇L̄(ζ) ≈ ∇µ,ΣL(µ+ Σ ξ). (10)
3.1 Deep Reinforcement Learning with NoisyNets
We now turn to our application of noisy networks to exploration in deep reinforcement learning. Noise
drives exploration in many methods for reinforcement learning, providing a source of stochasticity
external to the agent and the RL task at hand. Either the scale of this noise is manually tuned across a
wide range of tasks (as is the practice in general purpose agents such as DQN or A3C) or it can be
manually scaled per task. Here we propose automatically tuning the level of noise added to an agent
for exploration, using the noisy networks training to drive down (or up) the level of noise injected
into the parameters of a neural network, as needed.
A noisy network agent samples a new set of parameters after every step of optimisation. Between
optimisation steps, the agent acts according to a fixed set of parameters (weights and biases). This
ensures that the agent always acts according to parameters that are drawn from the current noise
distribution.
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) We modify DQN as follows: first, ε-greedy is no longer used, but
instead the policy greedily optimises the value function. Secondly, the fully connected layers of
the value function are parameterised as a noisy network, where the parameters are drawn from the
noisy network parameter distribution after every replay step. We used factorised Gaussian noise as
explained in (b) from Sec. 3. For replay, the current noisy network parameter sample is held fixed.
Since DQN takes one step of optimisation for every action step, the noisy network parameters are
re-sampled before every action. We call this adaptation of DQN, NoisyNet-DQN.
We now provide the details of the loss function that our variant of DQN is minimising. When replacing
the linear layers by noisy layers in the network (respectively in the target network), the parameterised
action-value function Q(x, a, ε; ζ) (respectively Q(x, a, ε′; ζ−)) can be seen as a random variable
and the DQN loss becomes the NoisyNet-DQN loss:
L̄(ζ) = E
[
E(x,a,r,y)∼D[r + γmax
b∈A
Q(y, b, ε′; ζ−)−Q(x, a, ε; ζ)]2
]
. (11)
where the outer expectation is with respect to distribution of the noise variables ε for the noisy
value function Q(x, a, ε; ζ) and the noise variable ε′ of the noisy target value function Q(y, b, ε′; ζ−).
Computing an unbiased estimate of the loss is straightforward as we only need to compute, for each
transition in the replay buffer, one instance of the target network and one instance of the learning
network. Concerning the action choice, we sample from the target network and we act greedily with
respect to the output action-value function. The algorithm is provided in Sec. C.1.
4
Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) A3C is modified in a similar fashion to DQN:
firstly, the entropy bonus of the policy loss is removed. Secondly, the fully connected layers of
the policy network are parameterised as a noisy network. We used independent Gaussian noise as
explained in (a) from Sec. 3. In A3C, there is no explicit exploratory action selection scheme (such
as -greedy); and the chosen action is always drawn from the current policy. For this reason, an
entropy bonus of the policy loss is often added to discourage updates leading to deterministic policies.
However, when adding noisy weights to the network, sampling these parameters corresponds to
choosing a different current policy which naturally favours exploration. As a consequence of direct
exploration in the policy space, the artificial entropy loss on the policy can thus be omitted. New
parameters of the policy network are sampled after each step of optimisation, and since A3C uses n
step returns, optimisation occurs every n steps. We call this modification of A3C, NoisyNet-A3C.
Indeed, when replacing the linear layers by noisy linear layers (the parameters of the noisy network
are now noted ζ), we obtain the following estimation of the return via a roll-out of size k:
Q̂i =
k∑
j=i
γj−irt+j + γ
k−iV (xt+k; ζ, εi). (12)
As A3C is an on-policy algorithm the gradients are unbiased when noise of the network is consistent
for the whole roll-out. Consistency among action value functions Q̂i is ensured by letting each action
value function have its noise be the same, i.e., ∀i, εi = ε. Additional details are provided in the
Appendix Sec. A.2 and the algorithm is given in Sec. C.2.
4 Results
We evaluated the performance of noisy network agents on 57 Atari games [3] and compared to
baselines that, without noisy networks, rely upon the original exploration methods (ε-greedy and
entropy bonus). We used the random start no-ops scheme for training and evaluation as described
the original DQN paper [21]. The mode of evaluation is identical to those of [20] where randomised
restarts of the games are used for evaluation after training has happened.
We consider three baseline agents: DQN [21], duel clip variant of Dueling algorithm [36], and A3C
[20]. The NoisyNet variant of each of the agents was described in the previous section, except for the
dueling case which is a straightforward adaptation of the DQN described in [36]. In each case, we
used the neural network architecture from the corresponding original papers for both the baseline and
NoisyNet variant. For the NoisyNet variants we searched over the same hyperparameters as in the
respective original paper for the baseline.
We compared absolute performance of agents using the human normalised score:
100×
Scoreagent − ScoreRandom
ScoreHuman − ScoreRandom
, (13)
where human and random scores are the same as those in [36]. Note that the absolute human
normalised score is zero for a random agent and 100 for human level performance. Per-game scores
are computed by taking the maximum performance for each game and then averaging over three seeds.
The overall agent performance is measured by either the mean or median of the human normalised
score across all 57 Atari games.
The aggregate results across all 57 Atari games are shown in Table 1, while the individual scores for
each game are in Table 2 from the Appendix. The median human normalised score is improved in all
agents by using NoisyNet, adding at least 20 percentage points to the median human normalised score
for all agents. The mean human normalised score is also dramatically improved for DQN and A3C
agents, but the mean score is worse for Dueling. Note that the mean human normalised score is often
dominated by the performance of the agent on just a few games and so is not a robust estimator of
overall agent performance. Interestingly the Dueling case demonstrates that NoisyNet is orthogonal
to several other improvements made to DQN.
We also compared relative performance of NoisyNet agents to the respective baseline agent without
noisy networks:

max(ScoreHuman,ScoreBaseline)− ScoreRandom

version in terms of median and mean human-normalised scores defined in Eq. (13).
As before, the per-game score is computed by taking the maximum performance for each game and
then averaging over three seeds. The relative human normalised scores are shown in Figure 1. As
can be seen, the performance of NoisyNet agents (DQN, Dueling and A3C) is better for the majority
of games relative to the corresponding baseline, and in some cases by a considerable margin. This
is especially evident in the case of NoisyNet-A3C, where the agent can solve some games that the
baseline A3C previously could not solve (e.g., see the results for freeway and Kangaroo in Fig. 2). In
some other games, NoisyNet agents provide an order of magnitude improvement on the performance
of the vanilla agent; as can be seen in Table 2 in the Appendix with detailed breakdown of individual
6
game scores. More information is provided in the learning curves plots from Figs 3, 4 and 5, for A3C,
DQN and dueling respectively.

5 Conclusion
We have presented a general method for exploration in deep reinforcement learning that shows
significant performance improvements across many Atari games in three different agent architectures.
In particular, we observe that in games such as Asterix and Freeway that the standard DQN and
A3C perform poorly compared with the human player, NoisyNet-DQN and NoisyNet-A3C achieve
super human performance. Our method eliminates the need for -greedy and the entropy bonus
commonly used in Q-learning-style and policy gradient methods, respectively. Instead we show that
better exploration is possible by relying on perturbations in weight space to drive exploration. This is
in contrast to many other methods that add intrinsic motivation signals that may destabilise learning
or change the optimal policy. Another interesting feature of the NoisyNet approach is that the degree
of exploration is contextual and varies from state to state based upon per-weight variances. While
more gradients are needed, the gradients on the mean and variance parameters are related to one
another by a computationally efficient affine function, thus the computational overhead is marginal.
Automatic differentiation makes implementation of our method a straightforward adaptation of many
existing methods. A similar randomisation technique can also be applied to LSTM units [10] and is
easily extended to reinforcement learning, we leave this as future work.
Note NoisyNet exploration strategy is not restricted to the baselines considered in this paper. In
fact, this idea can be applied to any deep RL algorithms that can be trained with gradient descent,
including DDPG [18] and TRPO [31]. As such we believe this work is a step towards the goal of
developing a universal exploration strategy.

A Algorithm Descriptions
A.1 NoisyNet-DQN implementation details
DQN [21] is an approximate value iteration technique that uses a deep convolutional neural network
to represent the Q-function as Q(x, a; θ), where θ are the parameters of the network. We used the
network architecture from [21] and also the same set up for interacting with the Atari games. We note,
however, that we did not use -greedy technique, instead relied solely upon NoisyNet for exploration.
In DQN, the neural network is trained by minimising the following loss:
L(θ) = E(x,a,r,y)∼D[yDQN −Q(x, a; θ)]2,
yDQN = r + γmax
b∈A
Q(y, b; θ−) (15)
where D is a distribution over transitions e = (x, a, r = R(x, a), y ∼ P (·|x, a)). Here θ− represents
the parameters of the target network which is updated (θ− ← θ) regularly and stabilises the learning.
The distribution D is generated by constructing a replay buffer were training examples are uniformly
sampled from previous experience tuples et = (xt, at, rt, xt+1). We now provide the details of the
loss function that our variant of DQN with noisy network is minimising. When replacing the linear
layers by noisy layers (the parameters are now noted ζ) in the network (respectively in the target
network), the parameterised action-value function Q(x, a, ε; ζ) (respectively Q(x, a, ε′; ζ−)) can be
seen as a random variable and the DQN loss becomes the NoisyNet-DQN loss:
L̄(ζ) = E
[
E(x,a,r,y)∼D[r + γmax
b∈A
Q(y, b, ε′; ζ−)−Q(x, a, ε; ζ)]2
]
. (16)
The goal of NoisyNet-DQN is to optimize the loss L̄(ζ) in terms of ζ.
A.2 NoisyNet-A3C implementation details
In contrast with value-based algorithms, policy-based methods such as A3C [20] parameterise the
policy π(a|x; θπ) directly and update the parameters θπ by performing a gradient ascent on the mean
value-function Es∼D[V π(·|·;θπ)(x)] (also called the expected return) [34]. A3C uses a deep neural
network with weights θ = θπ ∪ θV to parameterise the policy π and the value V . The network has
one softmax output for the policy-head π(·|·; θπ) and one linear output for the value-head V (·; θV ),
with all non-output layers shared. The parameters θπ (resp. θV ) are relative to the shared layers
and the policy head (resp. the value head). A3C is an asynchronous and online algorithm that uses
roll-outs of size k + 1 of the current policy to perform a policy improvement step.
In A3C, there is no explicit exploratory action selection scheme (such as -greedy); and the chosen
action is always drawn from the current policy. For this reason, an entropy loss on the policy is often
added to discourage updates leading to deterministic policies. However, when using noisy weights in
the network, sampling corresponds to choosing a different current policy which naturally favours
exploration. As a consequence of direct exploration in the policy space, the artificial entropy loss on
the policy can thus be omitted.
For simplicity, here we present the A3C version with only one thread. For a multi-thread imple-
mentation, refer to the pseudo-code C.2 or to the original A3C paper [20]. In order to train the
policy-head, an approximation of the policy-gradient is computed for each state of the roll-out
(xt+i, at+i ∼ π(·|xt+i; θπ), rt+i)ki=0:
∇θπ log(π(at+i|xt+i; θπ))[Q̂i − V (xt+i; θV )], (17)
where Q̂i is an estimation of the return Q̂i =
∑k
j=i γ
j−irt+j + γ
k−iV (xt+k; θV ). The gradients are
then added to obtain the cumulative gradient of the roll-out:
k∑
i=0
∇θπ log(π(at+i|xt+i; θπ))[Q̂i − V (xt+i; θV )]. (18)
A3C trains the value-head by minimising the error between the estimated return and the value∑k
i=0(Q̂i − V (xt+i; θV ))2. Therefore, the network parameters (θπ, θV ) are updated after each
10
roll-out as follows:
θπ ← θπ + απ
k∑
i=0
∇θπ log(π(at+i|xt+i; θπ))[Q̂i − V (xt+i; θV )], (19)
θV ← θV − αV
k∑
i=0
∇θV [Q̂i − V (xt+i; θV )]2, (20)
where (απ, αV ) are hyper-parameters. As mentioned previously, in the original A3C algorithm, it
is recommended to add an entropy term β
∑k
i=0∇θπH(π(·|xt+i; θπ)) to the policy update, where
H(π(·|xt+i; θπ)) = −β
∑
a∈A π(a|xt+i; θπ) log(π(a|xt+i; θπ)). Indeed, this term encourages ex-
ploration as it favours policies which are uniform over actions. When replacing the linear layers in
the value and policy heads by noisy layers (the parameters of the noisy network are now ζπ and ζV ),
we obtain the following estimation of the return via a roll-out of size k:
Q̂i =
k∑
j=i
γj−irt+j + γ
k−iV (xt+k; ζV , εi). (21)
We would like Q̂i to be a consistent estimate of the return of the current policy. To do so, we should
force ∀i, εi = ε. As A3C is an on-policy algorithm, this involves fixing the noise of the network for
the whole roll-out so that the policy produced by the network is also fixed. Hence, each update of the
parameters (ζπ, ζV ) is done after each roll-out with the noise of the whole network held fixed for the
duration of the roll-out:
ζπ ← ζπ + απ
k∑
i=0
∇ζπ log(π(at+i|xt+i; ζπ, ε))[Q̂i − V (xt+i; ζV , ε)], (22)
ζV ← ζV − αV
k∑
i=0
∇ζV [Q̂i − V (xt+i; ζV , ε)]2. (23)
B Initialisation of Noisy Networks
In the case of an unfactorised noisy networks, the parameters µ and σ are initialised as follows. Each
element µi,j is sampled from independent uniform distributions U [−
√
3
p ,+
√
3
p ], where p is the
number of inputs to the corresponding linear layer, and each element σi,j is simply set to 0.017 for
all parameters.
For factorised noisy networks, each element µi,j was initialised by a sample from an independent
uniform distributions U [− 1√p ,+
1√
p ] and each element σi,j was initialised to a constant
σ0√
p . The
hyperparameter σ0 is set to 0.4.
