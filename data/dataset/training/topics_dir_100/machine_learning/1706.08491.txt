1 Introduction
Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) entails clinical evaluation of multiple cognition
metrics and biomarkers. Metrics such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive test
(ADAS-cog) [7] comprise multiple subscores that quantify different aspects of a patient’s cognitive
state such as learning, memory, and language production/comprehension. Although computer-
aided diagnostic techniques for classification of a patient’s current disease state exist [4], they
provide little insight into the relationship between changes in brain structure and different aspects
of a patient’s cognitive state that occur over time in AD.
2 Methods
We created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that maps an input tuple com-
prising a patient’s current structural MRI (sMRI) scan and a future time (in number of months)
to the values of the patient’s 13 ADAS-Cog subscores predicted for that time. The architecture
(Fig. 1) consists of
• 3 convolutional layers, each comprising convolution, maximum pooling, and rectified linear
activation;
• 3 fully connected layers, each comprising N linear units and rectified linear activation, where
N = 6000, 1000, 500, respectively.
The first convolutional layer’s input consists of the specified sMRI scan; all outputs of the third
convolutional layer and the input prediction time are fed to all units in the first fully connected
layer. Weights in all convolutional layers were initialized as described in [2]. To prevent overfitting,
∗Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the
design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

dropout [8] with a probability of 0.5 was performed after max pooling in every convolutional layer
during training. Optimization was performed using the RMSProp [3] algorithm. A smooth L1
loss function was employed to reduce sensitivity to outliers [1]. The architecture was implemented
in PyTorch [6] and trained on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 with NVIDIA Tesla M40 Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs).
To evaluate the architecture, we performed 5-fold cross-validation with training and testing
data drawn from a set of tuples of sMRI scans, cognitive scores, and time intervals between MRI
and cognitive score acquisition. Intervals were multiples of 6 months between 0 and 36. Each fold
was stratified to contain equal numbers of subscores for each unique interval. To ensure that each
fold contained a sufficient number of tuples for each interval, the folds were drawn from a dataset
comprising 1000 entries.
All sMRI and cognitive score data used for evaluation of the architecture were obtained from
the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu).
2
The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers,
and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimers disease (AD). Only 1.5T MRI scans from
a quality-controlled subset of the ADNI1 phase of the project were utilized [13]. sMRI scans were
minimally preprocessed to remove non-brain tissue, normalize intensities, and register all scans to
a single coordinate space. All subscores were normalized to the range [0, 1] prior to training and
testing.
3 Results
We computed the root mean squared error (RMSE) for each of the 13 subscores for each interval
(Fig. 2). The means and standard errors across all intervals and subscores varied from 0.009 to
0.251 and from 0.001 to 0.046, respectively. To compare the performance of our network with
other approaches that only predict the aggregate score, we also computed the RMSE and Pearson’s
correlation coefficient of the predicted/actual aggregate score normalized to the range [0, 1] (Fig. 3).
We obtained the latter by rescaling the normalized subscores to their original respective ranges and
normalizing the sum using the highest possible aggregate score. The means and standard errors
of the RMSEs of our method’s normalized aggregate score prediction for the intervals considered
varied from 0.058 to 0.087 and from 0.014 to 0.028, respectively. The means and standard errors of
the correlation between predicted and actual aggregate scores across all intervals varied from 0.643
to 0.862 and from 0.040 to 0.149, respectively.
4 Discussion
To our knowledge, our architecture is the first to concurrently predict multiple cognitive examina-
tion subscores from minimally preprocessed structural brain data. Variations in prediction accuracy
across the subscores illustrate differences in the relationships between brain structure and specific
aspects of cognition that are obscured by prediction of the aggregate score. The mean perfor-
mance of our architecture when applied to aggregate score prediction is similar to that of existing
techniques that variously utilize stepwise regression [10], relevance vector regression [9], multi-task
learning [12, 11, 15], and support vector machines [14]. Since the quality of features extracted by
CNNs is proportional to the amount of training data and number of network layers [5], we an-
ticipate that deeper variations of our architecture trained on more extensive subsets of the ADNI
database will be able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
5 Conclusion
We have developed a CNN architecture that can predict the trajectories of the 13 subscores com-
prised by a subject’s ADAS-cog examination results from a current sMRI scan up to 36 months
from image acquisition time without resorting to manual feature extraction. Mean performance
metrics are within range of those of existing techniques that require manual feature selection and
are limited to predicting aggregate scores.
