Abstract—In this paper, we study the missing sample recovery
problem using methods based on sparse approximation. In this
regard, we investigate the algorithms used for solving the inverse
problem associated with the restoration of missed samples of
image signal. This problem is also known as inpainting in the
context of image processing and for this purpose, we suggest an
iterative sparse recovery algorithm based on constrained l1-norm
minimization with a new fidelity metric. The proposed metric
called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM) index, is a simplified version
of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, which is convex
and error-sensitive. The optimization problem incorporating this
criterion, is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results show the efficiency of
the proposed method for missing sample recovery of 1D patch
vectors and inpainting of 2D image signals.
I. INTRODUCTION
The algorithms for missing sample recovery, have many
applications in the field of signal and image processing [1],
where in the latter it is specifically known as image inpainting
[2]. Among various methods for missing sample recovery and
inpainting, including diffusion-based [3] and exemplar-based
[4] methods, some exploit the sparsity of the signals in the
transform domain [5], [6], [7], [8]. In this paper, we study this
class of algorithms where in, it is assumed that the signal is
sparse within a discrete transform domain. The sparsity of the
signal, enables us to reconstruct it from random measurements
even below the rate of Nyquist. This is known as Compressed
Sensing (CS) [9] which has applications in different areas
in signal processing [10]. The problem of reconstruction of
the sparse signal from random samples, is also a problem
of inverse modelling. Many algorithms are introduced for
this purpose within different applications in audio and image
processing.
Methods based on spare approximation use an index as
the measure of sparsity which is stated in terms of the p-
norm of the sparse signal. The most common vector norms
used to promote sparsity are `0 and `1 and the algorithms for
sparse recovery can be generally divided into two groups; The
algorithms based on `0-minimization and those based on `1-
minimization or the basis-pursuit method [11]. For detailed
survey on sparse recovery algorithms, see [12].
In this paper, we propose an alternative `1-minimization
method for sparse recovery of image signals. The proposed
method has application in image inpainting and restoration. We
introduce a fidelity criterion called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM)
Index, which has desirable features including convexity and
error-sensitivity. We study the missing sample recovery for 1D
and 2D signals using the proposed index as fidelity criterion
in our optimization problem. The 1D recovery algorithm is
applied for reconstruction of the vectorized small patches,
whereas its 2D variant can be directly used to recover missing
samples of the entire image signal.
II. IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
There are different criteria for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA). The most popular metric is `2 norm or MSE. But, there
are cases in which the MSE criterion fails to to accurately
recover the original signal. One reason is that this metric is
insensitive to the distribution of the error signal. Thus, there
are a class of alternative perceptual criteria introduced for
error-sensitive visual quality assessment. The most popular
measure from this class is SSIM, defined as [13]:
SSIM(x,y) =
( 2µxµy + C1
µ2x + µ
2
y + C1
)( 2σx,y + C2
σ2x + σ
2
y + C2
)
(1)
where C1, C2 > 0 are constant. This function whose mathe-
matical properties are discussed in [14], is non-convex (within
its entire definition domain), implying that its global optimiza-
tion is complex. Hence, in this paper, we use a simplified
criterion derived from the numerator and the denominator
terms appearing in (1). The proposed index named CSIM is
defined as follows:
CSIM(x,y) = K0
(
(µ2x+µ
2
y−2µxµy)+ρ(σ2x+σ2y−2σx,y)
)
(2)
where ρ and K0 are positive constants. The first parameter
controls sensitivity with respect to random disturbances versus
uniform change, i.e., unlike MSE, the new criterion has error-
sensitive variation. The parameter K0 is just used for scaling.
The proposed index also has feasible mathematical features,
including convexity (uni-modality) and positive-definiteness. It
can also be shown that if we use statistical estimates for mean

and variance/covariance of signals x,y ∈ Rn, the function
defined in (2) is algebraically equivalent to:
CSIM(x,y) = (x− y)TW(x− y) (3)

III. THE PROBLEM FORMULATION
Suppose x ∈ RN is the vectorized image signal and H ∈
Rm×N is the random sampling matrix which determines the
pattern of the available (missed) samples. The observed signal
with missing samples, is also denoted by y = Hx ∈ Rm. If
we assume that x has approximately a sparse representation
via a dictionary basis specified by D, the regular optimization
problem for sparse recovery is as follows:
min
s
||s||1 s.t. ||HDs− y||22 ≤ n (5)
where s denotes the sparse vector of representation coefficients
and n denotes the upper bound for the energy of the additive
noise (in case the observed signal is noisy). In addition to
`2 norm fidelity criterion, there are also methods based on
perceptual image quality metrics for recovery of the missing
samples. In [15] a method for image completion is proposed,
where for each corrupted patch, the optimization problem
below is proposed:
max
x,s
SSIM(x,Ds) s.t.
{
Hx = y
||s||0 ≤ T
(6)
This problem is iteratively solved using an approach based
on Matching Pursuit [11] via quasi-linear search methods
proposed in [16].
IV. THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
A. 1D sparse recovery
As discussed earlier, most of the algorithms use `2 norm as
fidelity criterion for image reconstruction. Here, we propose
to use CSIM instead of MSE to solve the missing sample
recovery problem (5). Hence, by introducing the auxiliary
variable x, we have the following optimization problem:
min
x,s
||s||1 s.t.
{
CSIM(Hx,y) ≤ n
x = Ds
(7)
Now, using Lagrange multipliers theorem, satisfying Karush-
Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions [17], the optimization problem
above is equivalent to:
min
x,s
CSIM(Hx,y) + α||s||1 s.t. x = Ds (8)
The convexity property of CSIM gives the guarantee to use the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [18] to
solve (8). Hence, the augmented Lagrangian cost function is:
min
x,s
L(x, s) =CSIM(Hx,y) + α||s||1 + ηT (x−Ds)
+
σ
2
||x−Ds||22 (9)
The ADMM alternatively minimizes (9) with respect to each
variable. Hence, at each iteration of the ADMM, the problem
(9) is separated into sub-problems as follows:
B. x sub-problem:
At t-th iteration, the augmented Lagrangian function asso-
ciating with x is:
x(t+1) = argmin
x
L(x, s(t)) = 1
2
xTKx + c(t)
T
x (10)
where
K = 2HTWH + σI
c(t) = −2HTWy − σDs(t) + η(t) (11)
This quadratic problem has a closed-form solution:
x(t+1) = −K−1c(t) = − 1
σ
[
HT (2/σW)H + I
]−1
c(t) (12)
Now, using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury lemma [19] to
calculate the inverse matrix, we have:[
HT (2/σW)H + I
]−1
=
[
I−HT (γ1I + γ211T )H
]
(13)
where
γ1 =
1
β1
, γ2 = −
β2
β1(β1 + nβ2)
(14)
and β1 = σ2w1 + 1, β2 = −
σ
2w1
w2
w1+nw2
. The parameters
w1, w2 are also given in (4) and equation (13) yields by
applying the inverse matrix lemma consecutively to obtain
(β1I + β211
T )−1. We have also used HHT = I. Thus the
update formula for x is:
x(t+1) = − 1
σ
(
I− γ1HTH− γ21H1TH
)
c(t), 1H = H
T1
(15)
C. s sub-problem:
The optimization sub-problem associating with s is:
s(t+1) = argmin
s
L(x(t+1), s) = argmin
s
L(s) (16)
Using the Majorization Minimization (MM) technique [20],
assuming ||D||22 = λ, Similar to [21] we define the surrogate
function LS(s, s0) = L(s) + λ2 ||s0 − s||
2
2 − 12 ||Ds0 −Ds||
2
2.
After simplifications, we have:
min
s
LS(s, s0) = min
s
λ
2
||s− a(s0)||22 +
α
σ
||s||1 (17)
where a(s0) = s0+ 1λD
T
(
x(t+1)−Ds0+ 1ση
(t)
)
. The solution
to (17) is obtained using the soft-thresholding operator S [21].
Setting s0 = s(t) we get:
s(t+1) = S α
λσ
(
s(t) +
1
λ
DT
(
x(t+1) +
1
σ
η(t) −Ds(t)
))
(18)
Now since s(t+1) is the minimizer of LS(s, s(t)) and
LS(s, s(t)) ≥ L(s), ∀s 6= s(t), minimizing (17) will reduce
the initial cost function L(s). We also use the exponential
thresholding method proposed in [22] to decrease the regular-
izing parameter α accordingly.

5: Update α = max(α× µ, αmin).

D. 2D sparse recovery
The proposed algorithm for patch vector reconstruction is
given in Algorithm 1. This method can also be directly applied
for holistic 2D image signal recovery from random samples.
If we denote the image signal by the matrix X ∈ Rn1×n2 , and
the sparsifying 2D transform by DT2D, we have:
S = DT2D(X), ||S||1,1 =
∑
i
∑
j
|si,j | ≤ T (19)
where S denotes the sparse matrix of the transform co-
efficients. If the inverse transform exists, we have X =
IDT2D(S) ≡ Ds, and thus, IDT2D may be considered a 2D
basis. Taking advantage of this, we can harness the sparsity
of fast 2D transforms like DCT2D and Curvelet [23], which
exploit 2D dependencies between pixels in an image more
efficiently compared to 1D transforms. First of all, for a 2D
signal, the CSIM criterion is reformulated as:
CSIM(X,Y) = trace
(
w1E
TE + w21
T
n1E1n21
T
n2E
T1n1
)
(20)
where E = X − Y. Furthermore, the product Wx used in
the first step of the proposed algorithm (x sub-problem), in
matrix form, is equivalent to the function below:
W(X) = w1X + w21n11
T
n1X1n21
T
n2 (21)
We can also model the sampling process with component-
wise (Hadamard) dot product by a 2D binary sampling mask
H ∈ Rn1×n2 , i.e., HX = HX. In addition to these 1D-
2D conversions (modifications), we also exploit an idea to
improve the performance of the algorithm for inpainting. As
proposed in [24], in each S upgrading step, we apply a linear
interpolation method to provide a more enhanced estimate
of the residual image. Hence, the final method is given
in Algorithm 2 where Intp denotes the linear interpolation
function, performed by moving average filtering the input
signal1.

V. SIMULATION RESULTS
A. Sparse vector recovery
In this experiment, we compare the quality performance
of the proposed method for recovery of missing samples of
image patches with some popular sparse recovery algorithms.
We use IMAT2, DALM3 [25], TV4 [26], FISTA [27], GOMP5
[28] and the method in [15] which we call it SSIM-based
Matching Pursuit (SSIM-MP). For simulations of this part,
we extract 8 × 8 patches of sample gray-scale images. We
then vectorize the patches using raster scanning and select
50 patch vectors at random. From each patch, we take m
samples, chosen uniformly at random, and the sampling ratio
of the signal defined as sr = mn varies between (0, 1). We
use over-complete (64 × 128) DCT and DWT6 dictionaries
for reconstruction. Since the exact sparsity is unknown, to use
matching pursuit methods we assume the signal is 10% sparse.
After the sparse recovery of missed samples, we then average
over random experiments and plot the PSNR and SSIM versus
the sampling rate. The parameters for TV and FISTA are
set to their default (source code) values. The values of the
exponential threshold parameters in IMAT are set to α = 0.2,
β = 0.2||DTHTy||∞ and λ = 0.5. The stopping criterion for
DALM and L1-LS are set to minimum duality gap. We choose
maximum iteration count of 50 as the stopping criterion for
the remaining algorithms. The parameters for our proposed
method are chosen as σ1 = 2mn = 2sr, µ = 0.8, ζ = 0.2,
K0 = n − 1 = 63 and ρ = 1.1. Also similar to FISTA,
The value of αmin is set to 10−4. As depicted in Fig. 1,

the proposed algorithm mostly outperforms the competing
algorithms and gives a better reconstruction quality compared
to DALM and TV which commonly solve the `1-optimization
problem using ADMM. The SSIM performance as given in
Fig. 1 also confirms this efficiency.
B. Image Completion
In this part, we compare the performance of the proposed
algorithm for 2D image reconstruction with several iterative
methods, namely IMATI [24], Hosseini et, al. [29] and the
well-know inpainting algorithms including Guleryuz [5], MCA
[6] and EM [7]. The parameters for IMATI are set the default
values λ = 1.8, itermax = 100 and  = 1e−4. The method of
Hosseini et, al. is simulated via DCT lowpass filtering method
with 10 iterations. The Guleryuz method has been run for 100
iterations using DCT 16 transform. The parameters of EM are
set to λ = 10, σ = 1 and  = 1e − 3 and for MCA we
choose itermax = 100 and λstop = 1e− 4. The parameters of
our proposed 2D algorithm are also chosen similar to the 1D
case except that we use K0 = 2.5(N − 1), σ = 6sr, λ = 1.2
and itermax = 40. Table I shows the reconstruction PSNR and
SSIM values for some test images at sampling rates 0.1, 0.3
and 0.5. We have used both DCT and Curvelet transforms for
reconstruction with our algorithm. The values in Table I which
are (PSNR, SSIM) pairs, confirm the quality performance of
the proposed method compared to other inpainting algorithms
in most cases. Furthermore, comparing the running time of the
proposed algorithm (with DCT transform) with other methods,
as given in Table II, implies its relatively low computational
complexity.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we proposed an iterative method for missing
sample recovery of image signals using sparse approxima-
tion. In particular, we proposed an algorithm based on `1-
minimization for missing sample recovery of 1D image patch
vectors. We incorporated the Convex SIMilarity (CSIM) index,
which similar to MSE, is well suited for mathematical manip-
ulations and like SSIM, benefits some sense of error-visibility
feature. The optimization problem incorporating this fidelity
metric is then solved via ADMM. We also introduced a 2D
variant of the proposed method which can directly be used
to inpaint the whole corrupted image without need to extract
and vectorize small patches. Simulation results approve the
performance quality of the proposed algorithm for 1D and 2D
image completion.
