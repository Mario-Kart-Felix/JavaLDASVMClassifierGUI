Abstract 
The Semantic Web is one of the main efforts aiming to enhance human and machine interaction by representing data in 
an understandable way for machines to mediate data and services. It is a fast-moving and multidisciplinary field. This 
study conducts a thorough bibliometric analysis of the field by collecting data from Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus 
for the period of 1960-2009. It utilizes a total of 44,157 papers with 651,673 citations from Scopus, and 22,951 papers 
with 571,911 citations from WOS. Based on these papers and citations, it evaluates the research performance of the 
Semantic Web (SW) by identifying the most productive players, major scholarly communication media, highly cited 
authors, influential papers and emerging stars.  
Keywords: citation analysis, semantic web, research evaluation, impact analysis 
1. Introduction 
        The Web is experiencing tremendous changes in its function to connect information, people and 
knowledge, but also facing severe challenges to integrate data and facilitate knowledge discovery. The Semantic 
Web is one of the main efforts aiming to enhance human and machine interaction by representing data in an 
understandable way for machine to mediate data and services [1]. Recently, PriceWaterhouseCoopers [2] has 
predicted that Semantic Web technologies may revolutionize the entire enterprise of decision-making and 
information sharing. The profile of the Semantic Web has been further heightened by the Obama administration’s 
new groundbreaking plan to initiate Semantic Web technologies to bring transparency to government activities 
[3]. Indeed, we see and hear the term “Semantic Web” almost everywhere.  
Why is the Semantic Web becoming so popular? One obvious reason: the increasing needs of individuals and 
society to process information with efficiency, speed and comprehensiveness. This primary need addresses the 
vexing issue of the Web’s over-flooded information. Ten years ago the Web largely contained documents,

allowing users to consume these documents and mine their nuggets in a timely and relatively straightforward 
fashion. But the explosively massive increase of websites has generated an information deluge, creating an often 
confusing and overwhelming format for gathering pertinent data within a reasonable period of time. For example, 
within the first few months of 2009 there has been an increase of 46 million websites [4]. The human capacity to 
read or consume this level of data is not possible to achieve in his lifetime. There is now a serious demand to 
distill documents into data that extracts core concepts from documents and represents them in a concise manner, 
such as RDF triples. A huge amount of documents can thus be shrunk to several data triples, which allows for 
easier consumption and retrieval. Yet even these improved cycles can go infinitively. As information deluge turns 
into data deluge, there is a need to add metadata to data, a process already in place. In turn metadata deluge will 
become another deluge, with no end in sight to this information abstraction. So while these abstracting processes 
can reduce the size of data and the burden for human use, they also create new challenges for data sharing and 
integration. 
Another major issue for Web users is the problem of data sharing and integration [5]. If data is isolated 
somewhere as a silo, its usage and function can be significantly limited. As the world is becoming increasingly 
linked [6], the proper sharing of data has become essential to virtually all fields. Since data is represented in 
widely different syntax and semantics, the tasks of integrating data may be profoundly complex. One of the major 
missions for the database community is thus to find efficient ways to integrate data. But this remains as a remote 
goal where no “shortcuts” are available. Data stored in databases are structured data, while most data on the Web 
are unstructured2. Integrating and sharing data becomes more challenging, as what is called the current “bag-of-
strings” nature of the Web does not facilitate connections that are machine-readable. These problems need to be 
addressed and solved. But there is no golden bullet. Semantic Web proposes technologies and methods that 
mainly address these two needs: how to add semantics to data and how to enable data integration [7]. 
        Ontology, the backbone of the Semantic Web, is the formal representation of domain schemas. An 
ontology provides a shared vocabulary by modeling the semantics of data and representing them in markup 
languages proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C plays a major role in directing 
international efforts at specifying, developing and deploying standards for sharing information [8]. Semantically 
enriched data pave the crucial way to facilitate Web functionality and interoperability. Semantic Web technologies 
thus open up new possibilities for developing applications that work across the Web by modeling and linking data 
with best practices. They provide a fundamental infrastructure to create, represent and instantiate ontologies and 
metadata so as to enable intelligent retrieval and discovery. Semantic Web technologies continue to influence data 
sharing and management in various fields, such as Digital Library, Knowledge Management, Data Mining, Social 
Media, Electronic Commerce and Web Services [9].  
        Although Semantic Web is derived from the arena of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where ontological 
research can be traced back to early 1980s, the groundbreaking progress in this area started from the late 1990s or 
2000, when significant funding was secured from the European Commission and United States to support these 
important innovations [5]. This paper uses citations and publications to illustrate this ten-year development in the 
Semantic Web field, with the special focus on semantics and ontology related research development. It is 
organized as the followings. Following this Introduction, Section 2 gives a brief history; Section 3 presents the 
research methods; Section 4 discusses the productivity and impact of this field, and Section 5 summarizes the 
results and addresses future research. 
2. Brief history 
        Ten years ago nearly all the Semantic Web researchers could fit into one meeting room. They had to 
attend various conferences to explain the difference between “ontology” and “oncology,” for the infrastructure 
and enabling methods/tools for Semantic Web were very unclear. Researchers still struggled with the migration of

existing artificial intelligent methods to the Web, and tried to avoid yet-another “AI Winter” [10]. The brief 
history described here focuses on several “firsts” in the field: the first language, first conference, first journal and 
first foundation. 
        In Europe, we claimed that the first EU-funded Semantic Web project was OntoKnowledge 
(http://www.ontoknowledge.org/, 2000-2002). It was led by the Free University of Amsterdam. The major output 
of this project was the development of the OIL language which was not scheduled as a formal deliverable from the 
proposal. This project triggered the first meeting of EU and USA researchers in Aachen, Germany in August 
2000. This meeting stressed the importance of the layered structure of OIL, and planned future EU funding for the 
community-formed Thematic Network for the Semantic Web (called the OntoWeb project, funded two years later 
by the EU). One month later, the second DAML and OIL meeting was held in Amsterdam. Three months later in 
December 2000, the DARPA Agent Markup Language Program officially announced that DAML+OIL was 
expected to be available that month, and in January 2001 its official version was released. DAML+OIL was later 
developed as OWL, which is currently the W3C standard and one of the key languages in the Semantic Web area. 
        The fundamental community-forming effort for the Semantic Web came from the OntoWeb project 
funded by EU from 2002-2004. The project created several “firsts” – the first conference, largely sponsored by the 
OntoWeb consortium, was held in Stanford in summer 2001. Named the Semantic Web Working Symposium. 
Afterwards, the conference was renamed as the International Semantic Web Conference and has been held 
annually thereafter in Europe, Asia and America in alternating years. Following the same pattern, the regional 
conferences were created. The first European Semantic Web Symposium was held in Greece 2004 and later on 
changed to the European Semantic Web Conference. The first Asia Semantic Web Conference was held in Beijing 
2006. Of course, nowadays, Semantic Web related topics are mentioned in almost all the major computer science 
related conferences and broadly spread to conferences in other domains, such as, biology, chemistry, life science, 
medicine, library science and so on. 
        Creating an international journal for the field was planned in the deliverable of the OntoWeb project but 
was first discussed at the Dagstuhl Workshop on the Semantic Web in March 2000. The initial plan was to start 
the journal under the rubric of the Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (ETAI), which was published 
under the scientific patronage of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the European Coordinating 
Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI). This journal in the end found its home in Elsevier in 2003, named 
as Journal of Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web. This journal grew with the 
community and received an impact factor of 3.023 from Journal Citation Report in 2009 published by Thomson 
Reuters. It is currently ranked as the 12th highest journal of 94 in the categories of Computer Science and 
Artificial Intelligence.  
        The first non-profit foundation was sponsored by the OntoWeb project and established in Amsterdam as 
“Stichting OntoWeb” (Stichting is the Dutch translation for “foundation”) in 2001. The Foundation’s objective is 
the advancement of research and development in the field of ontology and Semantic Web in general, and 
information exchange for knowledge management and electronic commerce in particular. Later on, this Stichting 
was moved to Karlsruhe and renamed the Semantic Web Science Association (SWSA). Now it supervises the 
organization of the International Semantic Web Conference series and other related conferences, workshops and 
summer schools and runs the Journal of Web Semantics. 
At this ten-year juncture of the Semantic Web, it is now important to identify its current status, including who 
the major players are, such as, the most productive and highly cited authors, and the new driving forces. Since this 
area is moving fast and leading innovations on web engineering, data integration and service architecture, there is 
a pressing need to conduct research performance evaluation. This paper uses works published in this field to 
portray its research landscape.

3. Related work 
        Although various critical problems exist in bibliometric analysis as a method to evaluate research impact, 
such as database-related problems, inflated citation records, bias in citation rates and crediting of multi-author 
papers [11], it has been extensively applied over the past decades [12]. The basic approach is straightforwardly 
counting, such as how many times a particular paper has been cited [13]. Advanced techniques have been 
developed as well, such as author co-citation analysis [14], the h-index [15, 16], social network analysis [17, 18] 
and PageRank [19]. 
Recently, for example, Huang [20] collected publications associated with research on Obstructive Sleep 
Apnea (OSA) during the period of 1991-2006 from Web Of Science (WOS) to identify and predict the trends of 
publication output, journal patterns, country of publication, and authorship. Sorensen [16] applied citation analysis 
to post-1984 research on Alzheimer’s Disease based on data from PubMed and WOS. Riikonen and Vihinen [13] 
examined the productivity and impact of more than 700 biomedical researchers in Finland from 1966 to 2000. 
Thijs and Glanzel [21] used different bibliometric indicators to profile European research institutes.  
But there are not many available researches on using bibliometric methods to evaluate the field of Semantic 
Web, partially because it is still a young emerging field.  Mika [22] and Mika, Elfring, and Groenewegen [23] 
conducted social network analysis for the Semantic Web research community based on researchers who have 
submitted publications or held an organizing role at the first, second and third International Semantic Web 
Conference (ISWC2002, ISWC2003 and ISWC2004) or the first Semantic Web Working Symposium in 2001. 
Their dataset contains 608 researchers. They compared the indegree, closeness, structural holes, publications and 
citations among these researchers and identified the core community and influential members. Zhao and 
Strotmann [24] used author co-citation analysis to detect school-of-thoughts for the XML field, which is quite 
broader than the Semantic Web field. As there is not a thorough citation analysis for Semantic Web research, this 
paper fills this gap by analyzing papers and citations produced in this field. 
4. Method 
        For citation analysis, WOS and Scopus are the two major authorized databases [25]. But since 2007, 
WOS has excluded all the major computer science conference proceedings and put them to the ISI proceedings 
which are not part of WOS anymore3. Because Semantic Web is a young emerging multidisciplinary field, we 
place our focus especially on the semantics and ontology related research (as discussed in Introduction part), 
which form the core part of the Semantic Web field. In April 2009, “Semantic*” or “Ontolog*” have been used as 
the search terms to retrieve related publications and their citations from titles, keywords, and abstracts of papers in 
WOS and Scopus, with the restriction to the computer science related areas, including Library and Information 
Science4.  The search query in WOS is TS5=(semantic* OR ontolog*) refined by subject areas related to computer 
science including theory and methods, artificial intelligence, information systems, software engineering, 
interdisciplinary, hardware and architecture, information science and library science, and cybernetics. There are 
23,670 items identified. After excluding editorial materials, meeting abstracts and others, there are 22,951 articles 
remained. For Scopus, the search query is TITLE-ABS-KEY (semantic*) or title-abs-key(ontolog*) refined by 
subject areas in computer science, library and information science, and other related multidiscipline, which results 
in 46,029 items. After excluding corrections, conference review and other notes, there are 44,157 articles 
remained.  
                                                          
3 http://isiwebofknowledge.com/media/pdf/cpci_faq.pdf 
4 Of course, there can be many other terms to retrieve related data in the Semantic Web field due to its multidisciplinary 
feature. But in this paper, we set our focus on research related to semantics and ontology (as addressed in the Introduction 
part), which are the crucial parts of the field. Other potential terms (e.g, RDF, XML, OWL, Linked Open Data, LOD, 
SPARQL, et al.) are therefore not included to retrieve data.

The main hypothesis for forming the search query for WOS and Scopus is that if this paper belongs to 
semantic web area, the authors should mention either "ontolog*" or "semantic*" in their title, keyword, or 
abstract. The reason why the semantic language terms are not included in the search query is that: 1) there are too 
many of them and they are still evolving, such as, XML, RDF, RDF-S, X-Query, SPARQL, RDFa, OWL, OIL, 
DAML+OIL, DAML, OWL-S, WSMO, WSML, GRIDDLE, SWRL, RIF, to name but a few. Also the OWL, OIL 
and DAML can lead to a large amount of noisy data, such as papers researching on OWL as an animal, or OIL as 
a product of oil industry. For example, Ian Horrock's most cited paper on OWL, in its title and abstract, there are 
semantic web and ontology mentioned. So if one paper never mentioned "ontolog*" or "semantic*" in title, 
abstract, or keyword, there is a high chance that this paper might not be directly related to the semantic web. So 
"ontolog*" or "semantic*" can be used to as search terms to capture the majority of papers published in the 
semantic web area6. 
In the end, there are 44,157 papers with 651,673 citations from Scopus covering 1975-2009, and 22,951 
papers with 571,911 citations from WOS covering 1960-2009. We took these two datasets to analyze the research 
performance of the Semantic Web community. Semantic Web is a continuous development of the World Wide 
Web. The major progress of this field started from early 2000 when it gradually acquired major funding from 
European Commission and USA. In order to portrait the details of this important phase, we divided the period of 
2000-2009 into 2000-2004 and 2005-2009 to better outline its dynamic changes.

6 Just for testing purpose, in Feb 2010, there are around 7,600 articles in WOS having OWL*“ appeared either in title, 
keyword or abstract. Only less than 10% of them are related to semantic web. Among them, more than 95% have ontolog* or 
semantic* appeared either in title, keyword or abstract. Same testing for using „RDF*“ as a search term for WOS, less than 
30% of articles, which have RDF appears either in title, abstract or keyword, are related to semantic web area. Among them, 
more than 90% have ontolog* or semantic* appeared either in title, keyword or abstract.

There have been consistent increases in Semantic Web (SW) publications in Scopus (red column) to date, 
taking into consideration that 2009 data was downloaded in April 2009. In Scopus, the 2008 publications nearly 
doubled the amount of total paper published during 1990-1999. Since 2000, there has been an average yearly 
increase in publications of 31.7%. In WOS, however, these numbers significantly dropped in 2007 and 2008, due 
to the exclusion of conference proceedings from 2007 on, especially those coming from major Semantic Web 
events such as the International Semantic Web Conference, European Semantic Web Conference, Asian Semantic 
Web Conference and the World Wide Web Conference. Among the total number of SW papers in WOS and 
Scopus, 50% are conference papers.

Lecture Notes in Computer Science and Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence are the two major publishing 
channels for SW papers, all of which are conference papers. This confirms that conference proceedings form the 
dominant publishing media reporting in the Semantic Web area. The top journals contributing to the publishing of 
SW papers are Theoretical Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Data and Knowledge Engineering, IEEE 
transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, Information and Computation and Artificial Intelligence. Most 
of the journals are in English, with one journal in Chinese, the Ruan Jian Xue Bao/Journal of Software.

5.1.2 Researchers 
In WOS, the number of publications produced by the authors have been counted and ranked based on the first, 
second, and third author respectively. We present them in three time periods: 1960-2009, 2000-2004 and 2005-
2009. For example, the first authors T. Eiter from Vienna Technical University, A. Brogi from University of Pisa, 
and H. Zhuge from Chinese Academy of Sciences are the top three most productive researches in 1960-2009. If 
we look at the recent period (2000-2009), H. Zhuge and T. Eiter keep their high productivity, while J. J. Jung from 
Yeungnam University, Korea emerges as a new star with 13 publications in 2005-2009, as does J. J. Alferes from 
University of Nova Lisboa, with 12 publications in 2000-2004 as first author.

Note: number presents the number of publications. Some of the current Chinese names, such as Liu, L., Ding, 
L., can be the combination of different people, but it is beyond the scope of current research to differentiate author 
identities (same for other tables below). 
Scopus contains all the excluded conference proceedings of WOS, and therefore has better coverage of the 
field. Within the total period, H. Zhuge, T. Eiter and J. J. Jung are the top three productive first authors. H. Zhuge 
maintains high productivity in 2000-2004 and 2005-2009, while J.J. Jung moves to the top one in 2005-2009 with 
25 publications as first author, and T. Eiter keeps his third position in 2005-2009. E. Bertino from Purdue 
University and M. R. Naphade from University of Illinois are ranked as the second and third top productive first 
authors in 2000-2004.

5.2 Impact 
5.2.1 Highly cited Journals/conferences 
In computer science, the major scholarly communication channel is shifting from journals to conferences7. 
Statistics on the Semantic Web, as one of the fast-moving subfields, show that the major highly cited channels are 
various conference proceedings published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science or Lecture Notes in Artificial 
Intelligence. In WOS (see Table 4), Artificial Intelligence, Communication of the ACM and Theoretical Computer 
Science journals are ranked the top three or four during these three periods. Looking at these top 20 highly cited 
journal/conferences, one finds that Semantic Web is closely related to artificial intelligence, computing theory, 
logic programming, database and bioinformatics.

Table 5 shows the top 20 highly cited journals or conferences from Scopus. There is no major difference 
between Table 4 and Table 5, where between them, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Communications of the 
ACM, Artificial Intelligence and Theoretical Computer Science are ranked within the top three during these three 
periods. Nature and Science emerge within the top 20 in 2005-2009.

5.2.2 Highly cited authors 
The number of times authors or their works get cited can be used to measure the impact of their works on the 
community. Table 6 shows the top 20 highly cited authors based on 571,911 citations from WOS. In the whole 
period (1960-2009), R. Milner is ranked as the top one for his contribution of pi-calculus for mobile processes, M. 
Gelfond top two for his work of logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning, and C. A. R. Hoare top three 
for his Quicksort algorithm and Hoare Logic, which brought him the Turing Award in 1980. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 
the inventor of the World Wide Web and Semantic Web, is ranked top four in the entire period, top two for 2000-
2004 and top one for 2005-2009, which shows his increasing impact within the community. T. Gruber’s ontology 
definition and his ontology engineering work are highly cited, causing him to be ranked as top three in 2000-2004. 
I. Horrocks’s fundamental contribution to the Semantic Web languages, especially OWL, moves his rank up to top

5.2.3 Highly cited papers 
Table 8 shows the ranks of highly cited papers in three different periods from WOS. T. Gruber’s ontology 
paper has been consistently highly cited and ranked as the top one for all periods. M. Gelfond’s stable model 
semantics for logic programming is ranked as the top two highly cited paper in 1960-2009 and top three in 2000-
2004. A. van Gelder’s well-founded semantics for general logic programs is ranked as the top three in 1969-2009 
and the top two in 2000-2004. T. Berners-Lee, J. Hendler and O. Lassila’s famous article about the vision of 
Semantic Web published in Scientific American is ranked as the top two highly cited paper in 2005-2009. M. 
Ashburner’s Gene Ontology article is ranked as the top three highly cited paper in 2005-2009. Through examining 
the highly cited papers in this field, one sees a clear shift from its beginning as being heavy artificial intelligence-
dominated with a focus on knowledge representation, logic programming and theory proving, to more data-driven 
practical approaches designed to realize the Semantic Web vision by converting the current document Web into a 
data Web. During 2005-2009, more papers from data mining, natural language processing and database are highly 
cited. Ontology forms the heart of the Semantic Web vision and approaches, and the community has accepted 
ontology definitions coming from T. Gruber. Ontology engineering is also moving from creating a theoretical 
foundation for ontology to the mapping of different ontologies. Ontology languages have slowly evolved from 
various logic languages derived from the core AI. Semantic Web services emerged in 2005-2009, mainly 
represented by OWL-S initiative (e.g., that of J. Hendler and S. Mcilarith).

6. Conclusion 
        This paper conducted citation analysis for the field of Semantic Web covering 1960-2009. Papers and 
citations were collected from two major databases, Web of Science and Scopus. The productivity and impact of 
the Semantic Web community have been analyzed, notably within the last decade of development for the periods 
of 2000-2004 and 2005-2009. The major publication channels in the Semantic Web field are conference 
proceedings, especially those published by Springer as the series Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences. Major 
journals that publish Semantic Web papers are Theoretical Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Data and 
Knowledge Engineering and IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. The most productive 
authors are T. Eiter, A. Brogi and H. Zhuge. J. J Jung is the newly emerging, very productive author in this field. 
The research impact has been analyzed based on citation counting. In the whole period (1960-2009), R. 
Milner, M. Gelfond and C. A. R. Hoare are ranked as the top three authors. Sir Tim Berners-Lee is ranked fourth 
throughout the period. Scopus citation data allows the ranking of cited second or third authors. J. Hendler, S. 
Staab and H. Garcia-Molina are ranked as the top three highly cited second authors, while O. Lassila, F. van 
Harmelen and I. Horrocks are the top three highly cited third authors. In WOS, T. Gruber’s ontology paper has 
been consistently highly cited and ranked top for all sub-periods. A. Van Gelder’s theory proving paper is ranked 
two, and S. Deerwester’s latent semantic analysis paper is ranked three. T. Berners-Lee, J. Hendler and O. 
Lassila’s article about the vision of the Semantic Web, published in Scientific American, is ranked as the top 
second highly cited paper in 2005-2009, while in Scopus, Gruber’s ontology paper and Berners-Lee’s Scientific 
American papers are the top two highly cited papers in 1960-2009 and 2005-2009. In both WOS and Scopus, the 
highly cited journals and conferences are Lecture Notes in Computer Science or Lecture Notes in Artificial 
Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Communication of the ACM and Theoretical Computer Science. In WOS, M. 
A. Harris, T. Harris and L. Ding are ranked as the top three authors with the highest increase of citations, while 
from Scopus, D. Roman, J. De Bruijn and L. Ding are ranked as the top three for the significant increase in 
number of citations. 
By comparing highly cited articles in 2000-2004 and 2005-2009, one can see the research shifting from core 
AI-related logic programming, logic reasoning and theory proving, to ontological languages (e.g., RDF, OWL), 
semantic data conversion and ontology mapping. One may therefore predict that within the next ten years, the 
following topics may become mainstreams in this field: 
 Creating, converting and enriching semantic data: this mainstream effort is led by the Linked Open Data 
(LOD) Initiatives created by C. Bizer of Free University of Berlin, Germany. LOD bubbles will grow to 
an amazing degree, becoming the major showcase of Semantic Web technologies. LOD creates the test 
bed for semantic query, reasoning and service/data mashups. It demonstrates a powerful, simple, flexible 
and efficient approach to integrating heterogeneous datasets and triggers the industrial, governmental and 
academic adoption. In 2010-2020, the efforts might focus on the quality issue of the LOD data, 
scalability of managing and querying LOD data, and security on data and SPARQL query; 
 Mining semantic RDF/OWL graphs: Semantic Web creates better technologies to represent and integrate 
data, while all these efforts should lead to the final goal: providing better search technologies. Since RDF

data form graphs, the searching and retrieving of RDF data utilizes the current Google approach: 
PageRank or HITS, wherein the topologies of graphs play the major role in ranking nodes in the 
networks. RDF graphs contain more semantics than normal graphs in Google, as the links and nodes are 
instances of the ontologies. Various weighted, topic-sensitive or semantic-sensitive PageRank may 
therefore become a new research topic in the ranking of semantic nodes. Provenance data once again 
becomes meaningful, wherein datasets need to be integrated. This development traces different steps of 
data integration and enables provenance-based layered data analysis, query and visualization;  
 Simple reasoning: Revolutionary breakthroughs should happen during the next few years as complex 
reasoning fails to scale up. Reasoning should be kept as simple as possible, scalable and error-tolerant. 
Relaxed or simplified logic may thus be invented to make this fly. 
 Benchmarking and evaluating ontologies: Nowadays ontologies have been created nearly everywhere, as 
noted in the introduction – a necessary step for solving the information-deluge problem. There is a 
pressing need to create a benchmark or widely adopted framework to evaluate and test these ontologies. 
Notably during the process of generating ontologies, domain experts may have a handbook in hand to 
ensure right decisions on the modeling of their classes, properties or instances. Examples may be found 
from other communities, such as TREC in information retrieval; 
 Interfacing Semantic Web: The next ten years should see to the creation of an innovative user-friendly 
interface to showcase the Semantic Web. Actually achieving goals of the Semantic Web is still currently 
impossible, as the search interface or SPARQL Endpoints for LOD datasets are not really targeted for 
normal users, and are instead accessible to SW gurus or hackers. To bring the Semantic Web out of the 
research lab and make its debut for normal users, a simple interface design is essential;  
 Utilizing social Web (Web2.0): The current social network fever in Web2.0 facilitates the generation of 
social semantic data, such as social tagging, commenting voting and recommending. These data identify 
existing relationships and create new ones, forming a “social power” that helps the LOD community 
snowball their datasets and introduce mashup powers of Semantic Web technologies. In the next ten 
years, we may predict that Web2.0 and the Semantic Web will be merged or interwoven in the manner 
that motivates normal Web2.0 users to contribute more social metadata, while Semantic Web should 
provide better technologies to mashup these data and further stimulate data generation. The difference 
between Web2.0 and Semantic Web will become blurred, as they finally merge to become the next 
generation Web –  Web3.0 – which extends current Web2.0 applications using Semantic Web 
technologies and graph-based open data [26]; 
 Embracing eScience and eGovernment: In the next ten years, eScience and eGovernment will be the 
major adopters of Semantic Web technologies. The current trend toward data integration, interlinking and 
analysis within health sciences, biology, medicine, pharmaceuticals and chemistry will lead to new 
technologies such as bio2rdf, Linked Open Drug Data and YeastHub. Semantic publishing will create 
new norms for the next generation of publishing, where RDF triples will be asked to add to paper during 
the submission required by the publishers like the current authors are all familiar with adding keywords 
to their articles. Journal or conference papers are no long just pure “static strings”. They contain 
important RDF triples which are interlinked in the paper, with other related papers (e.g., citations), and 
outside related semantic datasets (e.g., LOD bubbles). The substantial funding secured from NIH for 
CTSA8 and research networking for life science indicates the confidence and uptake of the Semantic 
Web technologies from other major funding agents in the United States, including NSF. The recent 
groundbreaking news from the USA and UK that their governments are ready to use the potential of the

Semantic Web technologies to build their transparent eGovernement platform (Shadbolt, Hall & Berners-
Lee, 2006). These, by no doubt, will create the tremendous momentum and broad social and societal 
impact on the Semantic Web. This momentum will radiate other fields which data integration is essential, 
such as environmental science to integrate data from hydrology, climatology, ecology, and oceanography 
[27].  
The challenges to the Semantic Web may be as significant as its promises. As I. Horrocks mentioned in his 
recent article, “The vision of a Semantic Web is extremely ambitious and would require solving many long-
standing research problems in knowledge representation and reasoning, databases, computational linguistics, 
computer vision, and agent system.” [8]. To carry on and further realize this vision, the Semantic Web community 
needs to work with researchers from related fields to establish the Semantic Web as the emerging interdisciplinary 
field – called “Web Science” – to view the World Wide Web as an important entity to be studied in its own right, 
and to understand its future as a computational structure and an interacting platform of people and machine [9]. 
Although there are twice as many Semantic Web papers in Scopus as those in WOS, the citation analysis for 
the field of Semantic Web does not show a significant difference between the two. For future research, we plan to 
use social network analysis to detect research groups or communities in this field. The use of self-citation also 
poses a new area of research that can be further extended to group self-citation or project self-citation in papers 
citing or cited by authors from the same research group or related projects. This may help identify the knowledge 
diffusion and transfer patterns in this field, as new and existing thinkers within this closely-knit community 
become necessarily self-referential.
