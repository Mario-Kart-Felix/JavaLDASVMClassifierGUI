The ‘twin challenges’ of the aging of the
population and the development of new
information and communication techno-
logies (ICTs) is becoming a new research
topic in recent years. Existing research on
aging and new ICTs often focuses on such
topics as the effects of age-related changes in
visual, perceptual, motor, and cognitive
abilities on older adults’ learning and use of
computers and the Internet, barriers to and
aids of their learning and use of new ICTs,
and older adults’ attitudes toward,
perceptions, and general usage of computers
and the Internet. This current research focus,
however, is very limited; many crucial issues
are understudied or, in some cases,
completely ignored. For instance, what
social, political, economic, cultural, and
technical factors have, either independently
or synergistically, caused or facilitated the
uneven computer and Internet usage
between older and younger adults? What
effects do various variables – nationality,
gender, ethnicity, cultural background,
education, class, profession, health status,
age, etc. – have on older adults’ experiences
with ICTs? What power asymmetries and
social relations are embedded in the current
technical design of ICTs? What impact might
the dramatic development of ICTs have on
the rapidly increasing older population? And,
what are the potential influences of an aging
population on the design and development
of computers and the Internet? To answer
these questions, this article argues, it is
important to pay more serious attention to
social and cultural factors that affect older
adults’ interactions with computers and the
Internet in various ways. The first four
sections of this article review existing
literature on aging and new ICTs. The fifth
section, informed by general theories of the
interdisciplinary field of science and
technology studies (STS), proposes a list of
new research questions for future
gerontechnology research.

B.Xie. Older adults, computers, and the Internet: Future directions. Gerontechnology 2003;
2(4):289-305. This article reviews existing literature on older adults’ interactions with computers
and the Internet, and proposes questions and directions for future gerontechnology research.
The first section of this paper briefly reviews existing human factors research on older adults’
interactions with computers and the Internet. The next two sections review research on barriers
to and aids of older adults’ learning and use of computers and the Internet, and older adults’
attitudes toward, perceptions, and general usage of computers and the Internet, respectively.
The fourth section summarizes available research on older adults’ interactions in computerized
community networks. Finally, based on existing literature on this topic and informed by general
theories of the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies (STS), the fifth section
proposes new questions and directions for future gerontechnology research.

approach. Human factors or ergonomics
research is an interdisciplinary field. In
general, it focuses on human-technology
interaction1,2. In particular, human factors
researchers working at the intersection of
aging and ICTs explore the effects of age-
related changes in visual, perceptual, motor,
and cognitive abilities on older adults’
learning and use of various computer and
Internet applications and related devices.
Furthermore, based on their understanding
of age differences in technology learning
and adoption, human factors practitioners
are devoted to exploring the interventions
that may help older adults to overcome
these age-related obstacles.
Age-related differences
A large number of human factors studies
have found age-related differences in older
adults’ learning and use of computers and
the Internet. For instance, studies observed
that older adults made more errors than
their younger counterparts in learning
computer text-editing software3-5; they
required more time and assistance than
younger adults to learn and use computer
software3, 6, 7; they had more difficulty than
their younger counterparts in learning to
use electronic bulletin board systems8, and
they had more difficulty using a computer
mouse9-12. Human factors researchers
suggest that the difficulties older adults
experience when learning and using ICTs
are related to age-associated changes in
visual, perceptual, psychomotor, and
cognitive abilities. For instance, a number
of studies suggest that age-related changes
in psychomotor abilities affect older adults’
use of computer input devices such as the
mouse and the keyboard9,13-16, while
impaired eyesight affects older adults’ use
of computers and the Internet13,17-19. Due
to their reduced perceptual and cognitive
abilities, older adults often experience
more difficulties in learning computer
software8,13,20-23, and navigating, browsing,
searching for, and retrieving information on
the World Wide Web19,23-25.
Design and training interventions
Two types of human factors interventions
are often addressed in the published
literature: guiding principles for designing
senior-friendly physical interfaces and
software18,19,26-36, and guidelines for
designing age-appropriate training instruc-
tions and materials6-8,18,19,23,25,32,37-43.
Overall, available human factors research
appears to suggest that, on the one hand,
age-related changes in visual, perceptual,
motor, and cognitive abilities make it more
difficult for older adults to learn and use
new technologies; on the other hand,
those difficulties can be at least partly
compensated by senior-friendly design of
technological interfaces and software, and
age-appropriate training materials and
strategies.
BARRIERS AND AIDS
Age-related changes in visual, perceptual,
motor, and cognitive abilities, coupled
with poor design, are some of the major
barriers to older adults’ learning and use of
computers and the Internet. Other major
obstacles include lack of access to
computers and the Internet17,44, lack of
prior experiences with new techno-
logies45, and negative social stereotypes of
older adults44. Often it is the synergistic,
rather than independent, effects of these
barriers that inhibit older adults’ learning
and use of ICTs. For instance, available
research indicates that lack of access to a
computer and lack of knowledge about
the Web are two primary predictors for not
using the Web46. The use of large-size
display screens (capable of displaying
large-size characters), assistance from a
trained computer demonstrator, and small
group settings (rather than large groups or
individual settings) are important
facilitators of older adults’ experiences
with computers47. While attitude towards
computers is the strongest predictor of
participation in an electronic bulletin
board system, success at initial training is
the most important predictor of continued

use of the system37. Multiple sources of
instruction – including class presentations,
individual lessons, functional “cue cards”,
manuals, expert peers, and periodic
meetings – must be given to facilitate
elders’ learning of computers48-50; and a
careful and supportive environment is
important to older adults’ acceptance and
use of new technologies51.
ATTITUDES, PERCEPTIONS, AND USAGE
A number of studies focus on older
people’s attitudes toward, perceptions of,
and general usage of computers and the
Internet. The results, however, are at most
ambiguous, and, not unusually, conflicting.
For instance, a telephone survey found
that, compared to their younger counter-
parts, older adults had less positive
attitudes toward and less usage of a variety
of technologies such as computers52.
Another survey found that participants’
attitudes toward and usage of computers
were influenced by their age, gender, and
prior experience with computers. In
particular, age was negatively related to
computer usage. Men reported more
computer usage than women and had
more positive attitudes toward computers
than women. Also, prior experience with
computers in everyday life was positively
related to attitudes toward computer
technology53. In May 1986, a survey was
conducted among visitors of the
Technology Center of the Biannual
Meeting of the AARP. About 10% of the
visitors of the Technology Center (N = 458)
volunteered to complete the
questionnaire. The results of this survey
generate more questions than answers: on
the one hand, 84% of participants
reported feeling “fascinated” and 78%
feeling “excited” when they thought about
computers; on the other hand, 50% of
participants stated that they felt
“confused” and 61% felt “ignorant” when
they thought about computers. Although
the survey itself has limitations – for
instance, the participants were self-
selected, and there were no control
groups, it does show that, on the one
hand, at least among the 10% who were
visitors of the Technology Center, the
majority of older adults were very positive
about computers. On the other hand,
however, at least half of them were having
difficulties with computers51.
On the other hand, other studies appear to
suggest that there are no age differences in
attitudes toward computers3, or that older
adults are quite positive about new
ICTs47,54-57. For instance, a study found that
the general response from the respondents
was positive, and older computer users
reported a trend of declined loneliness54.
Interviews with a small number of older
Internet users in New Zealand found that
older adults’ attitudes toward information
technology are mostly positive55. A two-
year ethnographic study of a group of older
computer users at a senior center in
California shows that older adults are
positive about and capable of using
computers, and computers have enhanced
the quality of life for older users56. In a
quasi-experimental study conducted at an
urban retirement center, respondents’
attitudes toward computers were examined
before and after a three-week period.
Older users reported that, after three
weeks of learning computer games and
computer-based communication, their
self-confidence was significantly higher
than before. Also, respondents stated that
they were more willing to play with
computers at the end of the three-week
period47. An experiment found that older
adults were willing and able to interact
with the computerized questionnaire.
Also, their acceptance of computer-
generated recommendations was high,
which indicated that older adults’ attitude
toward computer technology was quite
positive57.
The ambiguity of existing results is to a
large extent due to the fact that studies are

conducted during different time periods,
testing different computer technologies,
using different research methodologies,
and evaluating different samples.
Consequently, the results of available
studies on older adults and new ICTs are
not comparable. The lack of comparable
research calls for more empirical work.
COMPUTERIZED COMMUNITY
NETWORKS
Currently, the majority of social research
that explores the relationship between
older adults and ICTs is limited to the
individual level, as the above discussion
has shown; the issues of how
computerized networks have changed
people’s sense of community, and the
dynamics of interpersonal relations,
community networks, and social structures
in the new information era, are
significantly understudied. This literature
review has found only a handful of
relevant studies on the intersection of
older adults and computerized community
networks55, 58-62.
Surprisingly, the most exciting findings on
older adults and computerized community
networks often have come unexpectedly
or when researchers did not seem to have
a notion of ‘community’ in mind
(‘communities’ came into the picture as a
byproduct of other research purposes). For
instance, in a study that was originally
designed to explore older adults’
interactions with computer games,
researchers unexpectedly found that
participants favored interacting with other
people via computer networks, an
unplanned activity, more than playing
computer games47. This study, conducted
more than twenty years ago, is one of the
earliest studies that has revealed older
adults’ interest in and interaction with
computerized community networks.
In a yearlong study, researchers explored
the contributions of computer networks to
social structures and interpersonal
interactions at the workplace and among
retired individuals48-50. In this study, eighty
retired and working employees of a
governmental agency were recruited and
randomly assigned to either the “electronic
group”, or the “standard group”. Each
group consisted of an equal number of
recent retirees and current employees, and
each was assigned the same task force
project. The major difference between the
two groups was that the former were given
access to networked computers, while the
latter did not have access to computers.
Researchers found that the primary use of
the computer was for communication via
electronic mail – members of the elec-
tronic groups enjoyed sharing information
and working with other members of the
group via computer networks. Use and
perception of computers among members
of the electronic group, however, were not
necessarily associated with age. Indeed,
the most striking finding was that the
‘electronic retirees’ had the highest
participation rates by the end of the year.
Researchers suggested that the difference
between electronic retirees and working
employees was due to ‘office pressures’:
employees were directly or indirectly told
by their managers to use the computer only
when they had ‘free time’ (and few
employees would admit that they had ‘free
time’ when they were on duty). At the end
of the experimental time, the electronic
group formed their own online
community: the DEPCNET48-50. This study,
although conducted nearly two decades
ago, is still valuable to today’s research, not
only because it is one of the earliest studies
that has shown ICTs have the ability to
diminish the social isolation of those who
are retired and increase the social
‘connectedness’ of retired people, but also
because it indicates that, contrary to the
widely circulated stereotype, advanced age
is not the determinative factor of slow
adoption of new technologies; other
factors – in this case, how much ‘free time’

one had to practice – play important roles
in adopting new technologies.
Mary Furlong started a notable online
community -- SeniorNet -- for older adults
in the mid-1980s. SeniorNet was first
launched in March 1986, and it soon
evolved from a small on-line network that
mainly provided information to an
expanding electronic community where
older adults can communicate and
interact with each other58,59. According to
SeniorNet, the online community now has
over 39,000 members from various
nations and over 600 active discussion
groups that cover a wide range of topics63.
Since its launch, SeniorNet has been a
very useful research site for researchers
who are concerned about the influences of
computerized networks on older adults, as
a number of empirical studies have
shown55,58-61. For instance, in a study that
explored computer-mediated social
support among older adults, the
qualitative analysis of downloaded
SeniorNet conversations and the open-
ended questions of an online survey found
recurring social support themes60. The
quantitative part of this study – based on
an online survey -- also generated
interesting results: for instance, satisfying
online relationships positively correlate to
frequency of use -- namely, the more older
adults use the Internet, the more satisfied
they are with their online support network,
and vice versa61.
Overall, although several researchers have
explored how computers and the Internet
may affect older adults’ online and offline
social networks, research on older adults’
experiences in computerized social
networks is still an understudied area so
far and further attention is needed.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As demonstrated above, the new field of
aging and ICTs currently focuses on a very
limited number of topics. Many crucial
social and cultural aspects are under-
studied or, in some cases, completely
ignored. This section proposes a list of
research questions that deserve more
attention. The intention is not to offer a
complete list but to stimulate more
conversations and discussions on aging-
and ICT-related issues.
What positive and negative effects can
ICTs have on older adults?
A number of existing studies have
addressed the positive effects of ICTs on
older adults’ independence, social
networks, psychological well-being, and
social status. For instance, researchers
propose that information technology has
the potential to empower older adults64, to
enhance their social status (and,
consequently, the quality of the aging
experience)65, and to increase their
independence, integration in society,
interpersonal contact, opportunities to
contribute productively to society, control
over their environment, self esteem, and
the quality as well as the length of life66
Overall, ICTs can be used not only to treat
illness of older adults but also to maintain
their wellness44. However, more empirical
work that systematically examines these
theoretical hypotheses is necessary.
How can ICTs help older adults to
contribute their time, energy, and
intelligence to society and the
environment? An innovative Internet-
based program suggests that ICTs can
facilitate older adults’ participation in
environmental protection. The program,
developed by the Environmental Alliance
for Senior Involvement (EASI) and with the
collaboration of the Department of
Environment and Aging of Pennsylvania,
involves an online database that contains
water and habitat monitoring information.
Older volunteers are trained to conduct
relevant scientific tests to monitor the
water quality at over 500 sites in
Pennsylvania, and to input the results into

the online database67. In another project,
the Internet is used to connect middle-
school students who are studying recent
history, with older adults who have lived
through and can provide knowledge about
recent history. The results suggest that
online interactions between older and
younger people have changed the latter’s
attitudes toward studying history and
empathy for older adults68. These two
programs offer good examples of how ICTs
may help older adults to keep making
contributions to society even after
retirement.
Among empirical work that examines the
positive effects of ICTs, an ethnographic
research project explored how adult
children and elderly parents in dispersed
families interact via email, the telephone,
and transportation technologies. In
particular, the study explored technology-
based interactions between adult Jewish
Americans who immigrated to Israel and
their senior parents who remained in the
US. The findings suggest that ICTs have
helped to reinforce family ties and
intergenerational affections in distant
living and dispersed families69.
However, previous research tends to
neglect the possibilities that technology
might negatively affect older adults. “How
can our society assure that older persons
exercise sufficient judgment in using
information technology?” 44, p.435 In other
words, how can our society ensure that
older persons would not be overdepen-
dent on technology? Unfortunately, critical
questions like this are rare in the published
literature. Often positive effects of
technology are the default setting of
research; potential negative influences are
ignored. This literature review has found
that few studies address the potential
negative effects of ICTs on older adults.
One exception is a study on older adults’
use of the computer mouse, which warned
that use of computer input devices such as
the mouse that requires fine motions of the
wrist might cause physical damage to
older adults15.
What are the causes and consequences
of the digital divide between older and
younger adults?
It is important to realize that improved
design and training can only affect the
experiences of those older adults who
have access to computers and the Internet.
For older adults who do not have
computer and Internet access, the first
thing to do is to provide access for them.
Statistics in various countries have shown
that older adults’ access to computers and
the Internet are significantly lower than
their younger counterparts. Therefore, one
ought to ask, why? What kinds of forces --
social, cultural, economic, political,
technical, physical, synergistically or
independently -- have inhibited older
adults’ access to new technologies? And,
what can be done to ensure that older
adults will have equal access to new
technologies? These are the first questions
social scientists needs to ask, and,
unfortunately, these are also currently
understudied issues.
Public access at public facilities like
libraries and museums is a good way
to provide older adults with free access
to computers and the Internet17. However,
this will not be so helpful for older adults
with walking disabilities, which accounts
for a large number of the older population.
Also, public facilities often have time
constraints (they open and close at certain
times), which means older adults whose
only access to ICTs is at those public
locations cannot have unlimited access
to computers. This significantly weakens
the so-called ‘any where, any time’
value of the Internet. Without this
convenience, older users’ experiences
with ICTs will be less satisfactory, and,
consequently, they will be less motivated
to learn and use ICTs.

Recent research on the digital divide has
expanded from the original focus on
access to include the ways the Internet is
used70,71. For instance, a recent review
article defines the ‘digital divide’ as
‘inequalities in access to the Internet,
extent of use, knowledge of search
strategies, quality of technical connections
and social support, ability to evaluate the
quality of information, and diversity of
uses’70. Therefore, for those older adults
who already have access to computers
and the Internet, one needs to consider,
what are their actual experiences with
learning and using computers and the
Internet? How is older adults’ use of new
ICTs different from that of younger adults?
As discussed above, existing research,
especially human factors research, has
made significant contributions to
exploring this question. However, human
factors research often takes place in the
well-controlled laboratory or quasi-
experimental setting, which is very
different from the actual settings where
older adults interact with computers and
the Internet. Therefore, more empirical
and theoretical research that takes an
ethnographic approach and conducts
deep qualitative analysis to explore older
adults’ actual experiences with ICTs in
various social settings is necessary.
What can be done to ensure that older
adults’ learning and use of ICTs will be
easier?
Human factors researchers suggest that
senior-friendly design and training
interventions, guided by theories of
psychology and cognitive aging, can
facilitate older adults’ learning and using
of ICTs. Therefore, they are dedicated to
exploring various guidelines for interface
and system design, and training materials
and strategies that take into serious
consideration older adults’ special visual,
perceptual, motor, and cognitive
conditions. This approach has produced
valuable results, as the above discussions
have shown. However, it is important to
keep in mind that most existing design and
training recommendations have not been
tested systematically and thoroughly, as
some human factors practitioners have
warned28-29. Therefore, more systematic –
empirical and theoretical -- exploration of
new guidelines and thorough examination
of existing ones are still necessary.
Furthermore, human factors researchers
propose that theories of psychology and
cognitive aging can, and should, guide
technical design and training23,72.
However, this approach itself cannot offer
any guarantees that designers will
necessarily follow the proposed
guidelines. To do so, certain social
mechanisms, such as policy interventions,
are necessary. Also, in most cases young
designers fail to develop senior-friendly
products not because they do not want to
but because they are not aware of older
people’s special needs. Therefore,
intergenerational educational settings,
where older and younger students can sit
in the same classroom and take the same
course at the same time, may help
designers to design senior-friendly
interfaces and software. The success of
such a program -- the “Elder Connection”
intergenerational program -- supports this
point73. Clearly, in this program,
integrating older adults into higher
education systems facilitates intergene-
rational interactions between older and
younger people. Consequently, younger
students – future scientists, engineers,
designers, and manufactures – become
more aware of the existence and special
needs of older adults at a very early stage
of their professional development, and,
later in their careers, are more likely to
design and develop technologies that
better satisfy older adults.
These kinds of intervention are clearly
beyond the scope of the human factors
approach – after all, older adults’

interactions with technologies are also
affected by social and cultural factors (e.g.,
changes in their social and financial
circumstances due to retirement), which
cannot simply be resolved by technical
interventions as human factors practi-
tioners have suggested. Therefore, it is
important that other disciplines such as
political science and education pay
serious attention to the field of aging and
ICTs.
Also, to facilitate older adults’ learning and
use of ICTs, it is important to develop
computer applications that match older
adults’ special interests. Older adults, due
to their special situation, have different
needs and interests for computer
applications. For instance, research
indicates that older adults are more likely
than their younger counterparts to search
for health and medical information on the
World Wide Web, and develop such
hobbies as genealogy46,74. Are there any
other particular computer applications that
might satisfy older adults’ special needs?
Previous research that examines older
adults’ use of common computer tasks is
too general in this sense; more research
that aims at exploring and developing
‘senior-appropriate’ applications is
necessary.
What influences can older adults have
on technological developments?
Currently, most research that explores the
relationship between older adults and ICTs
are conducted in such fields as
psychology, cognitive and behavioral
science, and gerontology. One common
feature of those studies is that they often
explore the impact of technology on older
adults, yet ignore the possibilities of how
the aging population might actively shape
technological choice and development. In
the language of science and technology
studies (STS), the trend of current research
on the influence of technologies on older
adults reflects the tradition of techno-
logical determinism: because technologies
are independent of society and their
impacts on society are inevitable and
irresistible, it is only necessary and
possible to study the impact of techno-
logies on those people. This vision ignores
various social forces that shape techno-
logical innovation and development, and,
consequently, leaves older people in a
passive and vulnerable position. On the
contrary, social constructivism, a major
theoretical approach of STS, considers
how various social forces shape
technological innovation and develop-
ment. By examining the technological
content or the “black box” of technology,
social constructivism challenges the
distinctions between the social and the
technical. It suggests that technological
development, contrary to the claims of
technological determinists, is embedded
in, rather than separate from, the larger
social context. Social constructivism
reveals the possibility of social selection
among various technological choices or
alternatives. In other words, technologies
do not follow predetermined develop-
mental patterns that are out of human
control; rather, technologies are shaped by
various social factors and, as such, are
potentially subject to social constraints. By
fully acknowledging the active and
creative role that social forces have played
and are playing in technological
innovation and development, social
constructivism has revealed the possi-
bilities of democratic technological choice
and control75-79. In sum, based on the rich
literature on the social shaping of
technology, it is also necessary and
important to ask, in addition to how
technologies affect older adults: how can
older adults shape the design and
development of technologies? As Mary
Furlong, the founder of SeniorNet,
suggests: “Perhaps the greatest challenge
will be envisioning how these
technologies can harness the wisdom and
talents of our older adults. Not only are

they a growing demographic group but
they are also an important resource for the
continuing vitality and collective memory
of our society.” 58, p. 152
How can older adults help to guide the
design and development of ICTs?
Cyril Brickfield asks: ‘To what extent can
older people help guide technological
developments that may impinge on their
daily lives?’ 52, p. 31 His own answer is that
older people could serve as ‘consumer
advisers’ to help designers and
manufacturers to understand the needs of
older adults and to produce more
desirable products, and that older people
could be ‘instructors’ to help their age
peers to diminish fears or skepticism of
new technologies. Also, Brickfield
suggests that retired scientists and
engineers as well as other older
professionals can help guide technological
development. One such example is
‘Senior Scientists and Engineers (SSE)’, a
Washington DC-based volunteer organization
consisting of older professionals. At the time
when Brickfield wrote the article, SSE had
just started constructing a small (offline)
community that could support and
facilitate their missions. In 1998, with a grant
from the National Science Foundation, the
group built an online community that
allows members to interact across time
and space80. This form of (online and
offline) community is another way that
older adults can help to shape
technological innovation and develop-
ment.
Brickfield has asked the right questions –
older adults are not only affected by new
technologies in various ways but also can,
and should, contribute to steer
technologies; and his suggestions are a
good start for this long journey. For
instance, researchers at the Center for
Applied Gerontology at the University of
Birmingham in the United Kingdom have
established a panel of older adults – the
‘Thousand Elders’ – to serve as consumer
advisers to improve the design and
development of domestic technologies81.
However, it is important to keep in mind
that this approach – that older adults
could/should serve as consumer advisers
or peer instructors -- is not sufficient,
because this approach does not touch and
therefore cannot change deep, structural
factors that have caused older adults’
marginalized position in technological
design and development. In other words,
Brickfield’s approach still leaves older
adults in a vulnerable position: for
instance, how seriously designers and
manufacturers will take senior advisers’
suggestions is a big question. Also, being a
consumer adviser or peer instructor still
means that older adults cannot participate
in the early stages of the design and
development process of new technologies;
consequently, the choices that older adults
have are limited. More importantly, the
SSE is a good way to organize older
scientists, engineers, and other profes-
sionals; but it has left behind ‘lay’ older
people. After all, it is not just the
responsibility (and right) of experts – old or
young – to contribute to and guide
technological developments.
To ensure older adults’ participation in the
design and development of technologies,
it is important to overcome structural –
social, political, economic, institutional,
and ideological – barriers that prevent
older adults from participating in
technological design and development.
Richard Sclove’s approach is valuable for
this purpose82. Sclove is an STS scholar
who emphasizes the importance of citizen
participation in every stage of the design
and development of democratic techno-
logies. One of his main arguments is that
technologies qualify as a type of social
structure in that they function politically
and culturally in a manner comparable to
other, more commonly recognized kinds
of social structure such as laws, dominant

political and economic institutions, and
systems of cultural belief. Combining this
vision with Benjamin Barber’s notion of
‘strong democracy’, Sclove develops the
theory of a ‘democratic politics of
technology’: ‘If citizens ought to be
empowered to participate in determining
their society’s basic structure, and
technologies are an important species of
social structure, it follows that
technological design and practice should
be democratized’ 82,p.26-27. This theory
entails two corresponding elements: a)
democratic procedures for developing b)
democratic technologies. Procedurally,
Sclove suggests, citizens ought always to
have extensive opportunities to participate
in technological research, development,
and design to shape the evolving
technological order. Substantively, the
resulting technologies ought to be
compatible with strong democracy.
Are ‘lay’ citizens capable of participating
in and shaping technological design and
development? Sclove holds that nonexpert
citizens are, indeed, ‘in every sense the
experts.’ Although he does not specifically
address older people, his framework
certainly can be applied to this
population. Pierre Levy’s notion of
‘collective intelligence’ also supports the
idea that everyone, including older adults,
possesses particular knowledge and
expertise that technical experts do not
have83. Levy addresses the significance of
collective intelligence in the newly formed
knowledge space. In the information era,
he argues, knowledge becomes the
primary driving force of society and
history. This creates a new anthropological
space -- the knowledge space. In this new
space, the rules of social interaction and
the identities of human beings are
reconstructed. The redefined social bond
will be based on reciprocal
apprenticeship, shared skills, imagination,
and collective intelligence. This is
because, Levy suggests, “all knowledge
resides in humanity”: “No one knows
everything, everyone knows something…
If you are tempted to judge someone as
ignorant, look for the context in which his
knowledge can be turned into gold” 83,
p.13-14. As a result, ‘the other’, no matter
her/his social status, profession, and
educational background, is a source of
knowledge: s/he knows something that I
do not know, and therefore can contribute
to, in one way or another, the constructing
of intelligent human communities. For
Levy, in the knowledge space, the ethical
and aesthetic aspects of collective
intelligence are of the same importance as
its technological and economic
dimensions. Although Levy does not
specifically address older individuals, his
framework certainly applies to this social
group.
What are the major barriers that currently
inhibit older adults’ involvement in
steering technological development?
Human factors research reminds us that
current technical design and training is not
age-appropriate. To move one step further,
one ought to ask, why weren’t senior-
friendly design and training available in
the first place? Or, to say it slightly
differently, why was the older population
excluded from the design and develop-
ment of technologies?
STS scholars suggest that an understanding
of power asymmetries and social relations
among different social groups can help us
to understand the shaping of technological
development84-86. For instance, one major
approach of social constructivism -- the
social construction of technology (SCOT)
approach -- holds that the negotiations
among ‘relevant social groups,’ which refer
to those institutions, organizations, and
organized or unorganized groups of
individuals that are affected in one way or
another by the artifact, affect technological
design and development76-78. Langdon
Winner, among many other scholars,

suggests that, although it is important to
notice the existence and influence of
relevant social groups in the developmental
process of a technological artifact, it is also
important to notice the absence of other
social groups and, more importantly, to ask
the question of why those groups are
absent. He asks: “Who says what are
relevant social groups and social interests?
What about groups that have no voice but
that, nevertheless, will be affected by the
results of technological change? What of
groups that have been suppressed or
deliberately excluded? How does one
account for potentially important choices
that never surface as matters for debate and
choice?” 86, p.369 Clearly, these are also the
questions we need to consider if we intend
to address the barriers that inhibit older
people’s involvement in technological
innovation and development.
Following this direction, feminist studies
of technology provide a promising
approach that age studies can borrow. In
particular, the notion of ‘relevant but
absent’ social groups, as developed by
Anne-Jorunn Berg87, is of special impor-
tance for understanding older people’s
positions in the social shaping of new
technologies. Berg analyzes the design
and development of three smart house
prototypes and finds that, although the
home is traditionally considered to be the
domain of women, none of the three
prototypes have taken into account
women’s desires and needs. Indeed,
housework – which is traditionally
associated with women and includes tasks
such as cooking, washing, cleaning,
tidying, and mending – is almost
completely ignored. The designers and
producers of those projects – often male --
simply do not have any interest in
housework, probably at least partly
because they do not know too much about
housework. And the primary target
consumers of the smart home are those
who share the same image as the designers
and producers of those projects – namely,
the technically interested male. Berg’s
work clearly shows that although women
are a relevant social group, their interests
have been ignored in the smart house
projects. As Berg puts it, women as a
social group are “relevant but absent” in
the design and development of these
housing technologies87,p.310. Similarly,
older adults as a social group are currently
also “relevant but absent” from
technological design and choice. Looking
at power asymmetries and social relations
therefore can help to reveal structural
barriers that inhibit older people’s
involvement in steering technological
innovation and development.
The diversity of the older population
The older population is a diverse one, and
includes individuals of different
nationality, ethnicity, cultural background,
gender, education, class, profession,
health status, even age, etc. Therefore, it is
important to study the independent and
synergistic influences of these variables on
older adults’ learning and use of ICTs. A
good example is the ‘mediation model,’
which considers the impact of four factors
-- age, education, computer knowledge,
and computer anxiety -- on older people’s
computer interest88. Based on previous
literature, this model proposes that age
and education would affect older adults’
computer knowledge and computer
anxiety, and the latter two would be the
direct predictors of older adults’ computer
interest – in short, the impact of age and
education on older adults’ computer
interest would be fully mediated by
computer knowledge and computer
anxiety. The results partly supported the
hypothesized mediation model. In
particular, the results suggested that age
was negatively related to both computer
knowledge and computer interest, and
positively correlated with computer
anxiety. Educational level was positively
associated with computer knowledge and

computer interest, and negatively related
to computer anxiety. Also, computer
knowledge was negatively correlated with
computer anxiety and positively related to
computer interest, whereas computer
anxiety was negatively related to
computer interest. However, the data
indicated that computer knowledge and
computer anxiety could not fully explain
age-related variance in older people’s
computer interest. This suggested that the
oversimplified model ignored other
potential predictors of older adults’
computer interest, such as gender, class,
and health status. Although this study has
limitations, it signals an important starting
point for building up useful theoretical
frameworks that take into consideration
the synergistic influence of various factors
on older adults’ learning and use of ICTs.
Gender-related issues
Among the diverse factors that affect older
adults’ experiences with technologies,
gender deserves special attention for at
least two reasons. First, the older
population consists of more older women
than older men, since women often
outlive men. Second, older women
experience aging differently from older
men89. Currently, however, research on
older adults either ignores gender and
gender-related issues, or considers gender
as a variable that could be simply added
on to existing frameworks. In particular, in
the area of aging and ICTs, few studies
have explored and compared older
women’s and older men’s experiences
with ICTs. This literature review has found
only a handful of studies that specifically
consider gender-related issues. For
instance, an empirical study addressed the
impact of age- and gender-related changes
in motor and musculo-skeletal systems on
older adults’ use of computers and
associated input devices such as the
mouse. The results of the experiment
indicated that older adults, especially
older men, experienced significant
declines in joint range of motion of the
wrist and grip strength. The results warned
that use of computer input devices such as
a mouse that requires fine motions of the
wrist might cause physical damage to
older adults, especially older men15. A
qualitative study reported the experiences
of six older Australian women with
computers and the Internet. Those older
women were willing and able to use new
ICTs to communicate with their families
and friends, and to maintain their
independence and personhood90.
CONCLUSION
Available research suggests that older
adults’ experiences with ICTs are different
from those of younger adults in many
ways. Are those differences generational
or trans-generational phenomena? In other
words, will those differences disappear or
remain among future generations of older
adults? It is well documented that the slow
adoption of ICTs among the current
generation of older adults is to a large
extent due to lack of training and
knowledge in the workplace and at
schools. Therefore, it is not unreasonable
to suspect that, since today’s younger
generations in general have more
experiences with ICTs at school and work,
as these generations age, they will be more
familiar and comfortable with computers
and the Internet than the current
generation of older adults. However, as
some scholars have suggested, we should
be cautious in viewing the digital divide as
a generational phenomenon71. After all,
older adults’ interactions with ICTs are
embedded in and therefore influenced by
complex social and cultural contexts. If
the context remains the same, then the
interactions between older adults and ICTs
might as well remain the same. For
instance, if future prices of computer
equipment and Internet access are too
high for future generations of older adults
who have limited financial resources after
retirement, then it is likely that those older

adults, even though they might have had
prior experiences with and interests in
ICTs, would have to reduce or even
eliminate their use of computers and the
Internet later in life. More importantly, due
to the seemingly endless development of
new ICTs, the differences between older
and younger adults’ use of new ICTs are
especially likely to be trans-generational
when considering the larger issue of the
use of new technologies by older adults.
Just as today’s generation of older adults
faces many barriers to their use of
contemporary computers and the Internet,
future generations of older adults are likely
to face similar barriers in using future ICTs
– unless steps are taken to address the
structural obstacles that negatively affect
older adults’ participation in the design
and use of new technologies.
