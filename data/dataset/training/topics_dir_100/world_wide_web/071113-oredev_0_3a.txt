The web – content for humans 
Tasks often require to combine data on the Web:
− hotel and travel information may come from different sites
− searches in different digital libraries
− etc.
Humans combine these information easily
− even if different terminologies are used!

Web content – machine usable?
Automated use of web content is difficult
− partial information is unusable
− difficult to make sense of, e.g., an image
− automated conclusions from analogies is difficult
− difficult to combine information automatically
 is <foo:creator> same as <bar:author>?
 how to combine different XML hierarchies?
− …

The rationale for the Semantic Web
We have the web of documents 
(text, multimedia, ...)
− Interlinked network of 
documents
− Provided by independent 
sources
− Understandable 
representation and uniform 
access
− Web browsers make content 
available to users
− Users make use of content
We need the web of data
− Interlinked network of data
− Provided by independent 
sources
− Understandable  
representation and uniform 
access
− Programs  know how to 
relate data
− Programs make use of data 
Semantic Web (SW) =  
programmable data web

The way ahead
Complications
− Data – stored in databases, applications, etc.
− Represented in various formats
− Structured in various data models
− Formats and models change over time
− Data interoperability difficult
Approach: 
− Abstract from concrete representations
− Interoperability at abstraction level feasible
− Abstraction captures “semantics”

What is needed?
Languages for describing concrete data
− E.g., “13.50” vs. “Price: 13.50; Currency: Euro”
Languages for describing types of data (data models)
− E.g., Price: numeric monetary value; currency; per quantity; ...”
Methods/tools for mapping data models to data models
− E.g., ebXML (UN/CEFACT) to eBay
Methods/tools for searching data
− Query languages 
Methods/tools for interoperation with other web technologies
− E.g., with the document web
Etc. ...

Semantic Web basic building blocks
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (13)
© 2007 W3C
(13)
RDF – Resource Description Framework
Basic data model – a “triple”
− triple (s,p,o) is such that:
 “s”, “p”, and “o” stand for “subject”, “predicate”, and “object”, 
respectively
 conceptually: “p” connects, or relates the “s” and “o”
An example triple:
RDF is a general model for such triples
− machine readable formats like RDF/XML, Turtle, n3, RXR, …
… and that’s it!
(
<http://…isbn…6682>, # “Le palais des miroirs”
<http://…/original>, # “is a derivative of the original”
<http://…isbn…409X> # “The Glass Palace”
)
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (14)
© 2007 W3C
(14)
RDF Example
<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://…/isbn/2020386682">
    <f:titre xml:lang="fr">Le palais des mirroirs</f:titre>
    <f:original rdf:resource="http://…/isbn/000651409X"/>
</rdf:Description>
Set of triples form a graph – the RDF graph

RDF graph
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (16)

(16)
RDFS – RDF Schema
Simple forms of critical “meta knowledge”:
− what terms to  use
− what restrictions must apply
− what other relationships may hold
RDF Schema
− officially: “RDF Vocabulary Description Language”; the term 
“Schema” is retained for historical reasons…
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (17)
© 2007 W3C
(17)
RDF Schema
Relationships are defined among classes/resources:
− “type”: an instance belongs to a specific class (“«The Glass 
Palace» is a novel”)
 more precise: “«http://.../000651409X» is a novel”
− “subclass”: all instances of one are also the instances of the other 
(“every novel is a fiction”)
RDFS formalizes these notions in RDF
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (18)

RDF & RDFS
RDFS defines:
− Nodes: rdfs:Resource, rdfs:Class 
− Properties:  rdf:type, rdfs:subClassOf

− Triples <subject, predicate, object>
RDF syntax
− Textual representation of sets of triples
− XML, N3, ...
RDF semantics
− Intended meaning of sets of triples
− Constraints
− Implications

SKOS – Simple Knowledge Organisation Systems
Practical need: simplified representation frameworks
− for conceptual models
A system must be simple to allow for a quick port of traditional 
data
SKOS is a specialised representation framework
Suitable for thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading 
systems and taxonomies
− Dewey Decimal Classification, Art and Architecture Thesaurus, 
ACM classification of keywords and terms…
− DMOZ categories (a.k.a. Open Directory Project)
Wrapper around RDF
Adapt/define classes and properties within certain limits

SPARQL – Query Language for RDF
How to use data represented in RDF?
Extract / match / find data in RDF graphs
Basic need: language for query on RDF graphs
− example: “give me the (a,b) pair of resources, for which there is 
an x such that (x parent a) and (b brother x) holds” (ie, return the 
uncles)
− such conditions may be simple or complex
Queries  very important for distributed RDF data!
− Queries across distributed data bases
This is the goal of SPARQL (Query Language for RDF)
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (23)
© 2007 W3C
(23)
SPARQL example
SELECT ?isbn ?price ?currency                     # note: not ?x!
WHERE { ?isbn a:price ?x. ?x rdf:value ?price. ?x p:currency ?currency.}
Returns: 
[[<...49X>,33,£], [<...49X>,50,€], 
     [<...6682>,60,€], [<...6682>,78,$]]
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (24)
© 2007 W3C
(24)
SPARQL Usage 
Locally, i.e., bound to some programming environments
− Querying local RDF databases
Remotely, i.e., over the network
− separate documents define the protocol and the result format
 SPARQL Protocol for RDF with HTTP and SOAP bindings
 SPARQL results in XML or JSON formats
− big datasets often offer “SPARQL endpoints” for this protocol

(25)
OWL – Web Ontology Language
RDFS cumbersome for complex use
Complex applications may want more possibilities:
− similarity and/or differences of terms (properties or classes)
− construct classes, not just name them
− can a program reason about some terms? E.g.:
 “if «Person» resources «A» and «B» have the same 
«foaf:email» property, then «A» and «B» are identical”
− etc.
OWL – “Web Ontology Language”
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (26)
© 2007 W3C
(26)
OWL objectives
A conceptual model describes some domain
Ontology: formal description of a conceptual model 
OWL is a language for defining ontologies
− OWL is a meta modelling language – a logical language
Three layers of OWL are defined: Lite, DL, and Full
− “OWL Full” is the whole thing
 Complete logic
− “OWL DL (Description Logic)” restricts Full in some respects
 Mechanisable logic
− “OWL Lite” restricts DL even more
 Easily implementable 
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (27)

(27)
Creating RDF for document resources
Intelligent “scrapers” or “wrappers” extract structure information 
from a Web page…
− using conventions in, e.g., class names or meta elements
… and  generate RDF automatically (e.g., via an XSLT script)
Similar to what “microformats” do (typically non-RDF)
− They might not extract RDF, but use data directly in Web 2.0 
applications.
− other applications may extract it to yield RDF (e.g., RSS1.0)

(28)
GRDDL – Gleaning Resource Descriptions...
Existing documents may already contain useful descriptions
Create RDF data by systematic extraction
GRDDL – Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of 
Languages 
GRDDL offers a mechanism for retrieving descriptive data from 
document
GRDDL introduces 
− markup for declaring that an XML document includes gleanable 
data
− Describing an algorithm, typically represented in XSLT, for 
gleaning the resource descriptions from the document.

(29)
RDFa 
Enriching web documents by semantical annotations
− Without disrupting ordinary  web document use
− Enabling extraction of RDF and access as RDF
RDFa slightly extends (X)HTML by:
− defining general attributes to add metadata to any elements (c.f. 
“class” in microformats, but via dedicated properties)
− provides an almost complete “serialization” of RDF in XHTML
Similar to microformats approach but with more rigor and fully 
generic
− makes it easy to mix different vocabularies (which is difficult in  
microformats)

Where do technologies fit in?

Uses of Semantic Web Technologies
The Semantic Web provides technologies supporting such 
needs! For example:
− an abstract model for the relational graphs: RDF
− extract RDF information from XML (eg, XHTML) pages: GRDDL
− add structured information to XHTML pages: RDFa
− a query language adapted for the relational graphs: SPARQL
− characterize the relationships, categorize resources: RDFS, 
OWL, SKOS, Rules 
 applications may choose among the different technologies
 some of them may be relatively simple with simple tools (RDFS), 
whereas some require sophisticated systems (OWL, Rules)
− reuse of existing “ontologies” that others have produced (FOAF 
in our case)

Application trends
Use of SW technologies
− Creating added value within user organizations
− Taking advantage of the investment in XML as a common format
Used internally in various software tools, e.g.:
− Configuration descriptions
− Process descriptions
− Error reports, etc
Used for metadata descriptions of digital resources
− Obvious usage, of course
Used for data integration
− Big payoff! Lots of examples.

Semantic Web Technologies as tools
Specific Semantic Web tools
− Targeting specific needs not covered by other technologies
SW adds value to your applications:
− Makes “infeasible” functionality feasible
− Provides an agile platform for data (data functionality)
− Offers improved foundation for maintenance
Must avoid fragmentation
− The SW perspective is but one of many equally valid 
perspectives on data/information
− Reuse of your investment in your data/information
Interoperation – example domains:
− Document web
− Web services
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (55)
© 2007 W3C
(55)
Semantic Web in Document Domain
Semantic perspective on document web resources
− Preserve and support the document view of resources
− Enable semantic access to  descriptions embedded in resources
− Example: RDFa, semantic annotations of XML-based resources
−
Document perspective on semantic web resources
− Preserve and support the semantical access to resources
− Enable a document view of semantically represented resources
− Examples: generation of presentation structure and style sheets 
from data
−
Dual perspectives, but different objectives:
− Supporting methods and tools: RDFa, GRDDL, ...
 Olle Olsson: “The Semantic Web – an overview”, Øredev 2007 (56)

(56)
Semantic Web in Web Services
The Web Services (WS) toolbox enables loose coupling 
between service user and service provider
− Details in interaction controlled by descriptions – WSDL 
But content-related aspects of service use is not fully 
supported:
− Service discovery, service characteristics, etc
Emerging area: Semantic Web services
− Semantic descriptions extend core WS descriptions
− Support for semantic aspects on service use.
The aim: 
− provide a flexible service framework that addresses the 
challenges of the web – the dynamic character of services 
offered on the web

Conclusions
The Semantic Web is here to integrate data on the Web
− The public web
− Restricted webs
− Intranet 
The goal is the creation of a Web of Data
Core technologies/functionalities are standardised
− RDF, OWL, SPARQL, ... RDFa, ...
Additional needs/functionalities in the pipeline
− By extensions to existing technologies
− By additional tools and technologies
