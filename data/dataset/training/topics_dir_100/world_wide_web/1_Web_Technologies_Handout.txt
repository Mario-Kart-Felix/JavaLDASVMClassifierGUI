The Internet
• The Internet is a giant network of networks
• A network may include PCs, and other devices like 
servers or printers
• A network is connected through a communication 
channel
• Early research was performed by the US Department 
of Defense in 1962. This research group established 
ARPAnet (Advanced Research Project Agency) in order 
to connect the US Defense Department network
10
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
What did the Internet come from?
• Original aim was to create a network that would allow 
users of a research computer at one university to be 
able to ‘talk to’ research computers at other 
universities.
• A side benefit of ARPAnet’s design was that, because 
messages could be routed or rerouted in more than 
one direction, the network could continue to function 
even if parts of it were destroyed in the event of a 
military attack or other disaster.
• The users of the Internet took a direction of their own
11
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
History of the Internet
• The first long distance communication took place in 
1965 between a computer in MIT and California. 
• In 1969, four computers clients were connected 
together via ARPAnet. 
– How old is the Internet?
• Leonard Kleinrock is accredited with the idea of 
packet switching, which describes how data can be 
sent across a network

Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
History of the Internet
• The ethernet was developed by Xerox during this 
period. This was inspired by Robert Metcalfe’s PhD on 
‘packet networks’.
• An ethernet is a protocol for describing how computers 
can be connected in a LAN (Local Area Network)
• Through the use of Ethernet and ARPAnet the US were 
able to develop a working network
• In the late 1970s and early 1980s other networks were 
developed, e.g. CSNET, USNET and BITNET
13
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
History of the Internet
• In 1973 Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn                          
created the TCP/IP communication                  
protocols
• TCP/IP: Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol is a 
set of rules that describe how computers can 
communicate over a network
• To send information over the Internet, a computer 
packs data into Internet Protocol (IP) packets and 
labels them with the correct address. They are then 
sent across a packet switched interconnected-
network.

• 3-4 groups of 3-4 people!
• 15 minutes discussion then report back (1-2 minutes 
per group)
32
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Transmission
• Computers are connected together via a network or 
transmission line
• The objective of the ARPAnet project was to investigate 
the development of a decentralized computer network
• The network then became known as the Internet
• It has since adopted a suite of protocols called the 
Internet Protocol Suite or as more commonly known 
as TCP/IP
• Now, the Internet has grown to encompass a huge 
number of autonomous networks
33
31
32
33
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Internet Protocol Suite
• The Internet Protocol Suite includes a number of 
standard protocols. The two most common are:
– Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
– Internet Protocol (IP)
• A computer communication protocol is a description of 
the rules computers must follow to communicate with 
each other.
• TCP/IP defines how electronic devices (like computers) 
should be connected to the Internet, and how data 
should be transmitted between them.
• The TCP/IP protocol is embedded in TCP/IP software 
that is part of the operating system (OS)
34
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
TCP/IP
• TCP handles communication between applications
– TCP uses a fixed connection. 
– If one application wants to communicate with another via TCP, 
it sends a communication request. This request must be sent 
to an exact address. After a ‘handshake’ between the 
applications a communication line opens.
• IP handles communication between computers 
– IP is a connection-less protocol. With IP, messages are broken 
down into small independent ‘packets’ and are sent between 
computers via the Internet. IP is responsible for ‘routing’ each 
packet to its correct destination.
– Communicating via IP is like sending a long letter as a large 
number of small postcards, each finding its own (often 
different) way to the receiver. 35
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
TCP/IP
• TCP/IP is TCP and IP working together.
• TCP takes care of the communication between your 
application software (your browser) and your network 
software - the handshake
• IP takes care of the communication with other 
computers - the postal system which lets you address 
the package and put it into the post
• TCP is responsible for breaking data down into IP 
packets before they are sent, and for assembling the 
packets when they arrive.
• IP is responsible for sending the packets to the correct 
destination. Every computer has a IP address
36

Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
World Wide Web (www.)
• The World Wide Web (WWW or Web)                           
is often confused with the Internet
• The Web didn’t exist until the 1980s
• In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee created a set of technologies 
that allowed information on the Internet to be linked 
together through the use of links, or connections in 
documents
– http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html
• The language used to write these documents with links 
is HTML
37
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
The Web
• The Web was mostly text based until Marc Andreessen 
created the Mosaic browser in 1992
• Accredited for popularizing the WWW
• People started thinking about adding videos, sound, 
and graphics on the Web.
• Now many people think of the Web as the graphical or 
illustrated part of the Internet

Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
IP Addresses
• Each computer must have an IP address before it can 
connect to the Internet.
• A Web site has an IP address or a URL to identify it
• TCP/IP uses four numbers between 0 and 255, to 
address a computer.
• An IP address is a set of numbers such as 127.0.0.1
• TCP/IP uses four numbers to address a computer. The 
numbers are always between 0 and 255.
• IP addresses are normally written as four numbers 
separated by a period, like this: 192.68.20.50
40
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
IP Addresses
• 127.0.0.1
• Those four numbers are 32 bits
• 32 bits = 4 bytes
• TCP/IP uses 32 bit addresses. One computer byte is 8 
bits. So TCP/IP uses 4 computer bytes.
• A byte can hold 256 different values:
– 00000000, 00000001, 00000010, 00000011, 00000100, 
00000101, 00000110, 00000111, 00001000 .......and all the 
way up to 11111111.
41
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
IP Addresses
• There are four different  ways in which this set of 
numbers can be broken into class type A, B, C & D:
42
Class Type Range of Network Addresses
A 1 to 126
B 128.xxx to 191.xxx
C 192.xxx.xxx to 223.xxx.xxx
D 224.xxx.xxx.xxx to 254.xxx.xxx.xxx
40
41
42
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
IP Addresses
• The rapid growth of the Internet has led to a shortage 
of IP addresses. No one could have anticipated the 
Internet when the protocol was first devised
• The Internet Protocol (IPv6) will provide relief to this 
problem by lengthening the IP address from 32 bits to 
128 bits
• The new version is frequently referred to as IPng (IP 
Next Generation)
• In Dec, 2008 a study by Google showed that IPv6 
penetration was less than 1% of Internet hosts
• Last four IPv4 addresses allocated on February 3rd 
2011 43
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies 44
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Domain Names
• Names are easier to remember than a 12 digit (or 
longer!) number
• Some applications let you identify a computer or an IP 
network by using a logical  or domain name:
– www.ncirl.ie is a domain name
• When you address a web site, like http://www.tcd.ie, 
the name is translated to a number by a Domain Name 
Server (DNS)
• When a new domain is registered together with a TCP/
IP address, DNS servers all over the world are updated 
with this information
45
43
44
45
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Uniform Resource Locators (URL)
• A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address 
a document on the Web. 
• The name that corresponds to an IP address in the 
DNS is known as a URL
• A full Web address is like: 
– http://www.scss.tcd.ie/Owen.Conlan/php/xpath/index.html
• A URL usually follows these syntax rules:
– scheme://host.domain.country_code:port/path/filename
46
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
URL Codes
• For International use, the domains end in the country 
code
– .ie        For Irish websites
– .fr        French websites
– .co.uk United Kingdom
• Some URLs end in the following
– .com  Commercial institute or service provider
– .me    Personal website
– .edu   Educational institute
– .gov   Government
– .org    Nonprofit organization
– .net    Network Service Provider
– .mil     U.S. military
47
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Retrieving a URL
• TCP/IP is a collection of communication protocols that 
controls the way that information is broken up and 
posted over the Internet.
• HTTP takes care of the communication between a web 
server and a web browser.
• To retrieve a Web resource, the user either specifies a 
URL in the Web browser’s address or clicks on a 
hyperlink in a document
48
46
47
48
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Retrieving a URL
• HTTP is used for sending requests from a web client (a 
browser) to a web server, returning web content (web 
pages) from the server back to the client.
• The Web browser specifies the details of the required 
Web page in a HTTP Request message
• The Web server receives this request and after 
processing it completes the operation by returning 
either the document or an error in the HTTP Response 
message
49
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies• http://www.onlinescho ls.org/blog/how-the-internet-works/ 50
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
HTTP 
• Hypertext Transfer Protocol
• HTTP takes care of the communication between a web 
server and a web browser.
• HTTP is used for sending requests from a web client (a 
browser) to a web server, returning web content (web 
pages) from the server back to the client.
• Before the Web, the Internet protocol was FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol)
• FTP was too slow, and HTTP was invented
51
49
50
51
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
HTTP
• HTTP adopted the concept of hypertext links but its 
protocol includes other methods
• There are four messages within this protocol
– Connection: Establishes a connection between the client and 
the server
– Request: Asks for a resource
– Response: Delivers the resource
– Close: Terminates the connection 
52
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Client/Server Computing
• All web activity begins on the clients side - you could 
type a web address into the browser. The browser first 
consults with the DNS to translate the home page 
name into an IP address. It then sends a request to the 
server using the HTTP standard
• A server spends most of its time listening to the 
network  waiting for a document request
53
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Intranets & Extranets
• The first serious use of Web technology within 
business was for the implementation of Intranets
• Internet, Intranets, and Extranets are all networks that 
transmit data. 
• The difference is geographical location and security
• An Intranet is a secure network contained within an 
organization. It uses a firewall for maintaining security. 
Intranets are used only by company employees
• An Extranet is a secure network that allows outsiders 
to use an Intranet with permission. It is used to 
connect company suppliers, contractors and partners 
with employees 54
52
53
54
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
E-Mail Address
• E-Mail Addresses have a similar naming scheme to 
domain names
• Often they take the following format:
– UserName @ Organization .country_core
– or Owen.Conlan@scss.tcd.ie
• There are many Web based e-mail servies
• Eg. Microsoft offers hotmail, Google offers gmail
55
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Port Numbers
• A port number is used to distinguish between the 
individual networking applications that are running 
simultaneously above the TCP/IP protocol stack
• Port numbers for standard TCP/IP services may be 
referred to as well-known port numbers
– 80     HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - WWW
– 194   IRC (Internet Relay Chat) - Conferencing
– 21     FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
– 25     SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - E-mail
– 23     Telnet
56
Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Port Numbers
• Server processes are associated with a fixed port and 
the client must know the port in order to connect with 
the network service
• A Web server will normally be listening for connections 
on port 80. A web browser will use this port number by 
default when attempting to connect to the remote 
computer
57

Dr. Owen Conlan, Introduction to Web Technologies
Who owns the Internet?
• No person or organization owns the entire Internet
• As the Internet is a network of networks, each network 
is owned by a company
• This is similar to the motor-way and road system. Each 
town or state owns and maintains roads in its 
jurisdiction
