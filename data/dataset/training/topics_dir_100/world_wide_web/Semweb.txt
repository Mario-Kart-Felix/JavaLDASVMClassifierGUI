Foreword
This report is the result of a joint European Union Future Emergent Technology program (EU-
FET) and National Science Foundation (NSF) strategic workshop organised by the European
Research Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM). The workshop was held in
Sophia-Antipolis (France), October 3rd-5th, 2001. Jérôme Euzenat, helped by Dieter Fensel and
Eric Miller, welcomed 20 European and US researchers from the field of knowledge
representation and engineering, database, worldwide web and man-machine communication.
The semantic web is a web whose content can be processed by computers. It can be thought of
as an infrastructure for supplying the web with formalised knowledge in addition to its actual
informal content. The workshop was aimed at envisioning the future of the “semantic web”
emergent research area in order to identify required breakthroughs and to put forward
recommendations to the funding bodies.
The workshop was composed of two days of participant presentations on an agreed topic.
These presentations were grouped into four sessions (Languages, Resources and infrastructure,
Clients and human interface, The semantic web in application areas). After each session, a
general discussion was held in order to identify topics to be further discussed. On the third day,
participants were split into four working groups and elaborated research perspectives and
agendas for the years to come.
Instead of presenting a summary of each presentation session of the workshop, we have
preferred to gather the presentation summaries in appendices and focus on core topics that were
discussed by the dedicated working groups on the last day of the workshop. These groups were
concerned with Languages and inferences, Infrastructure, Human-related issues, and Ontology.
A few application scenarii have caught the attention of the audience: semantic web for
electronic commerce, knowledge management and bioinformatics. Some of these applications
could be seeding applications (both test benches and early adopters for semantic web
techniques: the bioinformatics community could be for the semantic web what the physics
community has been for the web). The report has thus devoted a section to these application
scenarii.
For each working group, a reporter has provided a summary report: Frank van Harmelen for
“languages and inferences”, Jérôme Euzenat for “infrastructure”, Nicola Guarino and Rudi
Studer for “Ontologies” and Simon Buckingham Shum for “human factors”. In addition,
individuals contributed to the application parts: Dieter Fensel for “e-commerce and the
semantic web”, Carole Goble for “Bioinformatics and the semantic web”, Jérôme Euzenat for
“A semantic web of personal universes” and Rudi Studer for “Knowledge Management”. The
workshop participants were:  Michel Biezunski, Simon Buckingham Shum, Vassilis
Christophides, Stefan Decker, Jérôme Euzenat, Dieter Fensel, Carole Goble, Nicola Guarino,
Ian Horrocks, Henri Lieberman, Brian McBride, Deborah McGuinness, Eric Miller, Enrico
Motta, David Pearce, Hans-Georg Stork, Rudi Studer, Bhavani Thuraisingham, and Frank van
Harmelen. Jérôme Euzenat has coordinated the production of this report.
This report has circulated among the workshop participant and been amended and can be
considered as a view of the workshop as a whole

Executive summary
The web today enables people to access documents and services on the Internet. Today's
methods require human intelligence. The interface to services is represented in web pages
written in natural language much must be understood and acted upon by a human. The
semantic web augments the current web with formalised knowledge and data that can be
processed by computers. Some services will mix human readable and structured data so that
they can be used by both humans and computers. Others will support only formalised
knowledge and will only be used by machines. This will enable:
—  computers to assist human users in tasks; the computers can “understand” the data in
ways they cannot today,
—  the creation of a more open market in information processing and computer services
enabling the creation of new applications and services from combinations of existing
services.
It will be beneficial for the society as a whole: for the economy because it will allow
companies to better interoperate and to quickly find the best opportunities. It will benefit
citizens because it will support them in their day-to-day work, leisure and interaction with
organisation and because it will help them to enforce the degree of control they want (over
their personal data, preferences, etc.).
This report is the synthesis from a strategic workshop on the semantic web, which has been
organised by the European Consortium in Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM) for the
European Union Future Emergent Technology program (EU-FET) and the US National
Science Foundation (NSF). The workshop which was held in Sophia-Antipolis (France),
October 3rd-5th, 2001, gathered 20 European and US researchers from the field of knowledge
representation and engineering, database, worldwide web and man-machine communication.
The participants considered the various aspects of languages and inferences, infrastructure,
human-related issues, ontologies as well as applications and proposed what follows.
Like the web, the semantic web is not an application; it is an infrastructure on which many
different applications (like electronic commerce) will develop. Characterising the “killer
application” of the semantic web will be as hazardous as predicting that of the web ten years
ago. Instead there can be several potential seeding and test applications for the semantic web:
business-to-business electronic commerce, bioinformatic knowledge grid, personal
semantic assistants, or more generally knowledge management. The development of a few
pilot applications could boost the takeoff of the semantic web.
The most important topics to be investigated for supporting the semantic web development
have been clustered in four broad categories:
—  Identification and localisation is an important topic for semantic web reasoning,
annotating and computing. It amounts to agreeing on how some resources can be
identified, how two identifiers can be compared or equated and how web resources can
be localised for processing. This involves works in language, infrastructure and
ontological areas: identity must be taken into account in the semantics of representation
languages, and the assumptions related to object identity must be made explicit in
ontologies and manageable by the infrastructure. The infrastructure must support the
localisation of and access to identified resources.
6
—  Relationships between semantic models across languages and modelling styles must
be overcome. Heterogeneity must be considered as an intrinsic feature of the semantic
web: no language will be suitable for all purposes, no model will be applicable to all
cases and no ontology will cover the infinity of potential applications. Because a
semantic description of information and knowledge is available, heterogeneity can be
dealt with. This involves developing layered and modular representation languages for
the semantic web, studying the impact of modelling assumptions on interoperability,
providing a transformation infrastructure, articulating and composing services and
transformations, supporting reuse and evolution by metrics for comparing models and
distributed version models.
—  Tolerant and safe reasoning is needed for dealing with the web and the accuracy of
the results must be assessed. A variety of reasoning methods will be necessary for
different applications (from fetching to theorem proving) and the quality of their
required results will vary (from anything-will-do to 100% certified). This involves
coping with messy metadata and the open character of the web with tolerant computing
techniques, providing an infrastructure for implementing safe computing with proven
properties, and developing new computational models for trust, proofs and rewards on
the web.
— Facilitating semantic web adoption is a critical point for the semantic web. It will first
depend on the availability of resources and then on the ease of use of the semantic web.
This can be supported by the development of foundational ontologies and well-crafted
ontology libraries, text mining and ontology and metadata learning, studies of the
growth model and acceptance factors of the semantic web, incidental knowledge
capture, supporting consensus building tools and lightweight collaboration.
Concerning the modalities of research funding, the following recommendations have been
made:
—  Support worldwide collaboration between researchers, because it allows reaching
consensus on the world level required for the web (and not at the continental one).
Funding non project-focussed work is necessary for producing reports, surveys and
studies.
—  Encourage open source development of high quality components and non-profit
shelter organisations for software development (like Apache).
— Support efforts for building seeding applications of the semantic web. We first need a
set of existing applications for improving on them.
—  Provide educational support (e.g. teaching material, company “educating”, starter
kits).

The semantic web(s)
“A web talking to machines”
The goal of the semantic web is to be “a web talking to machines”, i.e. in which machines can
provide a better help to people because they can take advantage of the content of the Web. The
information on the web should thus be expressed in a meaningful way accessible to computers.
This definition is easily related to what already exists on the web: wrappers for extracting data
from regularly structured pages, natural language analysis for extracting web page contents,
indexing schemes, syndication facilities for broadcasting identified web resources. Much of
this is painful and fragile: the semantic web should make it smart and robust.
The semantic web can also be thought of as an infrastructure for supplying the web with
formalised knowledge in addition to its actual informal content. No consensus exists on how
far the formalisation should go: it ranges from metadata schemes (like the Dublin core
metadata markers) to full-fledged logical representation languages. This exists only for
particular applications (e.g. SHOE, Ontobroker) and is currently limited to a small subpart of
the web.
One of the challenges of the current semantic web developments is the design of a framework
in which all these understanding can collaborate, because the full benefit of the semantic web
can only be attained when computers relate resources from various sources.
Applications
Like the web, the semantic web is not an application; it is an infrastructure on which many
different applications (like electronic commerce) will develop. Characterising the “killer
application” of the semantic web will be as hazardous as predicting that of the web ten years
ago. The usage does not precede the technology, but it explodes when the technology is
available.
There seem to be two approaches to the application of the semantic web:
— Semantic web applications for the organisations such as the development of ontology-
based marketplaces for business to business electronic commerce, or the bioinformatic
knowledge grid in which biological data and knowledge bases are seamlessly
interconnected and computing resources are available.
—  Semantic web applications for the masses such as intelligent personal assistant
gathering and filtering relevant information and composing it in a coherent picture with
regard to the user preferences (the travel assistant scenario).
More generally, knowledge management, personal or corporate, can take advantage of the
semantic web. The semantic web will provide value to any semantically annotated resource by
facilitating its retrieving when appropriate.
We present below four scenarii, that could be seeding and test applications for the semantic
web, and consider the technical challenge for achieving major breakthroughs involved in
building one of these semantic webs.
Requirements
The key requirement for the semantic web is interoperability. If machines have to take
advantage of web resources, they must be able to access them and use them. As a consequence,
the resources must be open and understandable. The resources should not be hidden in a
12
proprietary system which only publishes information in a human or tool-oriented format: they
must be invokable and published in an open, structured and rich format that let the machines
make the best out of them.
Identifying the semantic web with a particular technology (search engine, knowledge
representation, natural language processing, etc.) or language (XML, RDF, DAML+OIL, etc.)
is certainly not accurate.
The realisation of a semantic web will require several layers of developments presented in
figure 1. An infrastructure will allow identifying, locating, and transforming resources in a
robust and safe way. Languages are necessary for expressing the content of the semantic web;
the semantics of these languages is sanctioned by inferences engines. Resources such as
ontologies, transformations, metadata, and databases must feed these two base layers. The
resources of the semantic web are exploited by applications that run on devices.

Figure 1. High-level layered view of the semantic web.
This schema roughly corresponds to the working groups that have been set up during the
workshop.
Who is involved?
The development of the semantic web will involve efforts in many areas of computer science:
web technology, knowledge representation, database, automated theorem proving, knowledge
engineering, computer-supported cooperative work, human-computer interaction, natural
language processing, etc.
Moreover, the semantic web must not be separated from many aspects: personalisation (and
thus privacy issues), mobility (and thus reliability issues), publication (and thus security issue).
These issues and topics are quite traditional but the semantic web drive them to their extreme
because the use of semantically grounded languages make the computer actions more powerful
and the threats more acute.
Nevertheless, for the semantic web to happen, it is not just a matter of technology. It involves
technology, economics, and social matters. A trade-off must be found between these domains
that could lead to a value adding, appealing, and easy to use semantic web.
13
All these aspects must be articulated in a delicate alchemy for the semantic web to take off and
provide real value to its users. This is why many applications should be encouraged on top of a
solid infrastructure so that the fittest raises the utility of the semantic web.
Potential
Expectations are very high for the semantic web because information overload currently
reduces the usability of the web and the lack of interoperability between web services is an
obstacle to realizing its best promises. The improvements resulting from the development and
use of the semantic web in some areas might provide values for both users and providers and
result in increased activities (economic, social, cultural, etc.) like the web did in the 90s.
The semantic web is going to happen. It is going to happen, because it is necessary for
improving the information infrastructure. It is necessary for commercial companies, which
want to better, interoperate (either in business to business electronic commerce or in the
worldwide-enlarged enterprise). It is necessary for the citizens who want a better service from
the “suppliers” and their administrations and a more efficient protection of their privacy.
When? Now, in ten years or in a century. This mainly depends on what is expected from a
semantic web. The semantic web is happening now, the semantic webs are happening now, if
one thinks of the many initiatives for marking up resources (syndication, open catalogues, and
annotations). It is several years ahead if one thinks of agents realising one of the scenarii
presented below.
The semantic web will have fully succeeded when no one talks anymore of the semantic web,
but simply calls it “The web”.

Application scenarii
One can find a number of application scenarii for the semantic web. We present below several
application areas in which the semantic web shall be beneficial.
Theses applications could be both test benches and early adopters for semantic web techniques.
E-Commerce and the semantic web
The web has drastically changed the online availability of data and the amount of electronically
exchanged information. It has revolutionised access to personal information and knowledge
management in large organisations. Also, it has started to change the commercial relationships
between suppliers and customers. Around 1% of the overall sales figures in B2C in the US are
done on-line. This is still a small fraction but its fast growth looks very likely given that the
number of Internet users grew from 100 to 300 million between 1997 and 2000. Forecasts for
the dollar value of B2B in the US range between $0,5 and $3 trillion for 2003. Currently, a
large fraction of the B2B transactions is still realised by traditional non-Internet networks, such
as those conducted over EDI systems. In this traditional paradigm, direct 1-1 connections and
mappings are programmed. However, this traditional paradigm nowhere near employs the full
power of electronic commerce and it is quite likely that it will soon to be out-ranged by more
timely, Internet and web-based types for transactions. Internet-based electronic commerce
provides a much higher level of flexibility and openness that will help to optimise business
relationships. Instead of implementing one link to each supplier, a supplier is linked to a large
number of potential customers. Therefore, a supplier or customer can choose between a large
number of potential customers and can optimise his business relationships.
Bringing electronic commerce to its full potential requires a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach.
Anybody must be able to trade and negotiate with anybody else. However, such an open and
flexible electronic commerce has to deal with many obstacles before it becomes reality.
—  Mechanised support is needed in finding and comparing vendors and their offers.
Currently, nearly all of this work is done manually which seriously hampers the
scalability of electronic commerce. Semantic Web Technology can make it a different
story: Machine processable semantics of information allows mechanising these tasks.
— Mechanised support in dealing with numerous and heterogeneous data formats. Various
“standards” exists on how to describe products and services, product catalogues, and
business documents. Ontology technology is required to define such standards better
and to map between them. Efficient bridges between different terminologies are
essential for openness and scalability.
—  Mechanised support in dealing with numerous and heterogeneous business logics.
Again, various “standards” exist that define the business logic of a trading partner. A
simple example: A trading agents using RosettaNet expects an acknowledgement after
sending a purchase order, however, an agent using EDI will never send such an
acknowledgement. Mediation is needed to compensate these differences, allowing
partners to cooperate properly.
Therefore, applying semantic web technology to bring electronic commerce to its full potential
is such a promising activity. Semantic web technology has the potential to solve some of the
key obstacles in effective and efficient electronic commerce and electronic commerce is an
area with a large economic potential. It is also the natural way to link semantic web technology
16
and web services. Transferring the latter from hype to a working technology requires the
solutions of the problems we mentioned above.
Towards e-science knowledge grids
E-Commerce reflects the globalisation of business and the way that commerce is changing.
Similarly the way that science is done in biology is changing. E-Science is the use of electronic
resources—instruments, sensors, databases, computational methods, computers—by scientists
working collaboratively in large distributed project teams in order to solve scientific problems.
Large-scale science, as illustrated by the Human Genome Project, will increasingly be carried
out through distributed global collaborations enabled by the Internet that will require access to
very large data collections, very large scale computing resources and high performance
visualisation. In practice biology has already moved to large interdisciplinary teams distributed
throughout the world working together on specific problems. Post-genomics and high
throughput experimentation is promising to overwhelm the community with an avalanche of
data that needs to be organised and harnessed. The data is often complex, generated through
different media, variable in quality, stored in many places, difficult to analyse, often changing
and mostly comprised of incomplete data sets. Analysis methods to handle the different types
of data are constantly and rapidly evolving. The questions we ask of the data, and the
computational analyses to ask them, are more complicated: multiple species rather than single
species; whole genome rather than single gene; whole metabolic lifecycle rather than single
biological process. The computational power needed to model metabolic pathways or cells will
be huge. Consequently, the traditional scientific experimental methods are supplemented with
“in silico experiments”, for example, the prediction of genes and the metabolic pathways they
encode from the genomic DNA of an organism.
In the early 1990s web technology was rapidly taken on board by the biological community as
a way of disseminating data and analysis methods that were readily accessible to the wider
biology community. The Web enabled individual scientists to answer simple “low volume”
questions over large but relatively simple data sets without needing a profound knowledge of
computer science. The sharing of data repositories and tool libraries became straightforward.
Widespread collaboration was possible even if it was just by publishing a simple web page.
However, standard web technology is now straining to meet the needs of biologists. The next
step is a much more powerful infrastructure to generally support further growth of e-Science:
the Grid. The Grid should enable collaborative groups of scientists to ask complex questions
over complex data sets without a profound knowledge of computer science.
What is the Grid?
“The Grid” is a vision of “…flexible, secure, coordinated resource-sharing among dynamic
collections of individuals, institutions, and resources—what we refer to as virtual
organisations”. Resource in this context includes computational systems and data storage and
specialised experimental facilities. Now the Grid is seen as more as a platform to support
coordinated resource sharing and problem solving on a global scale for data-intensive and
compute-intensive applications.
The major differences between the Grid and the Web are in the increased computing power
available; the increased volume of data that can be handled and the speed with which data can
be transferred between nodes on the Grid. The Grid will also provide vast capacity to store and
17
retrieve data from a variety of sources and will allow the presentation of data obtained in the
same format, regardless of its source. The main thing is that for the Grid to work it must work
seamlessly and transparently: the scientist won’t care where calculation is done or where data
is actually held, it will just happen. The success of the Grid will be when a bioinformatician,
like a database curator, finds it easier to use than not, and a biologist only knows it’s there
when it breaks.
A Grid-enabled scenario
Let’s use a scenario to present the potential of a system that uses the Grid (another one can be
found in the EPSRC report, see the “resources” section). Robert is a biologist in a team
examining yeast gene expression. Before conducting a microarray experiment he has checked
whether any other similar experiment has taken place and if the data was already available. The
system recommends a set of parameters for the machine. A sample is logged into a database
and labelled. The microarray machine, recognising Robert from the log, sets parameters to
those he has used on previous runs. The parameters are recorded with the output results, which
are stored in his personal database alongside the image results.
The results are immediately accessible by Robert from his office where he analyses them with
a number of specialist statistical computations and a complex interactive time-series
visualisation both of which dynamically exploit a number of available computational resources
to get better performance. The visualisation is examined collaboratively with a colleague on a
remote site. Both scientists attach online personal notes to the results. Several products with up
regulated expression look interesting. A search using the SRS database portal identified this
gene as encoding a transcription factor. Papers, in free text, quoted to the database entries and
extracted online from the Medline digital library reveal that, in certain circumstances, it could
control genes related to the yeast gene of interest. The system recommends other scientists who
have published work or experiments that are related.
The system inspects Robert’s labs various transcriptome databases, and discovers genes that
were co-regulated with the original gene also share a target site. This information is added to a
yeast database with a link to the workflow of database interrogations and analysis tools that
lead to the discovery, including versions of databases, parameter settings, versions of the
algorithms and the lab that made the discovery.
Other scientists with appropriate access rights to this database who have run an analysis that
included the gene in the last month are automatically notified with this new information.
Another scientist incorporates the results into a simulation of a metabolic pathway they are
running, using a problem-solving environment. The simulation is monitored by various
colleagues around the world, who record both private and public observations. The simulation
and its results are added to a public database, and trigger new simulations automatically.
Requirements
This scenario illustrates six major characteristics, and challenges, of the proposed Grid:
An open platform to facilitate interoperability: the Grid plans to be a universal platform
bridging heterogeneous systems. The Grid connects all the players in a scientific endeavour:
the instruments and sensors; the databases and documents; the machines and networks and the
18
people (e.g. via video). This platform must be scalable, be able to evolve to be future proof and
be fault-tolerant, robust, persistent and reliable. Metadata (data about the data) describes the
environment, the services available and the ways they can be combined and exploited.
Resources are advertised, brokered, monitored and removed.
Large scale distributed information management: the Grid should store and process the huge
volumes and diversity of content efficiently. Content can be combined from multiple sources in
unpredictable ways depending on the users’ needs, and users should be able to discover,
transparently access and process relevant content wherever it is located on the Grid. New
methods are needed for archiving, mining, manipulating and sharing information derived from
multiple sources.
The explicit management of experimental process or “workflow”: The “workflows”—how
database searches and analysis tools flow together to generate a result—are as important and
exchangeable as the results they generate. Recording, and sharing, workflows helps: improve
experimental practice by avoiding unnecessary replication of in silico experiments (or in vitro
experiments for that matter); assist in setting up of equipment or computational processes in
appropriate ways; and ensure that conclusions are not drawn that are not fully justified by the
techniques used.
Coordinated distributed resource sharing: computationally intensive data analysis and
predictive modelling can take advantage of spare resources available on machines connected to
the Grid. Resources are discovered, allocated and disbanded dynamically and transparently to
the user.
Collaborative science: users will form, maintain and disband communities of resources, use
video conferencing and shared collaborative environments to jointly solve problems.
Governance services: a distributed environment on the scale of the Grid requires a number of
core services built into its fabric to govern the whole scientific environment: ownership and
watermarking; provenance, quality, audit, versioning; authentication, security and
confidentiality; change management and propagation, personalisation and configuration and so
on.
The Web was originally developed at CERN as a scheme for enabling Physicists to exchange
ideas. It worked because the Physics community had a real problem and the computer scientists
worked with them to solve their problem, not some other problem.
A semantic web of personal universes
Beside these organisational semantic webs where organisations invest a lot of time for
providing the semantic web with data and knowledge (because they expect some income from
the semantic web), there is room for personal involvement into the semantic web (because it
will provide some income to individuals). Personal involvement is more difficult to obtain
from users, but once initiated, it reveals more fruitful.
We present below a scenario involving personally handled data. A different one can be found
in the ‘scientific american’ article (see the “resources” section)
Scenario
During her stay at Honolulu, Clara run into several interesting people with whom she
exchanged vCards. When time to rest came in the evening, she had a look at her digital
assistant summarising the events of the day and recalling the events to come (and especially
her keynote talk of the next day). The assistant popped up a note with a link to a vCard that
19
reads: “This guy’s profile seems to match the position advertisement that Bill put on our
intranet. Can I notify Bill’s assistant?” Clara hit the “explain!” button. “I used his company
directory for finding his DAML enhanced vita: he’s got the required skills as a statistician who
led the data mining group of the database department at Montana U. for the requirement of a
researcher who worked on machine learning.”, Clara hit then the “evidence!” button. The
assistant started displaying “I checked his affiliation with university of Montana, he is cited
several times in their web pages: reasonably trusted; I checked his publication records from
publishers’ DAML sources and asked bill assistant a rating of the journals: highly trusted.
More details?”. Clara had enough and left her assistant inform Bill’s.
Bill’s and Peter’s assistants arranged a meeting in Paris, just before ISWC in Sardinia. Thanks
to Peter assistant knowing he was vegetarian, they avoided a faux pas. Bill was surprised that
Peter was able to cope with French (his assistant was not authorised to unveils that he married
a woman from Québec). Bill and Peter had a fruitful meeting and Bill will certainly be able to
send Peter an offer before he came back to the US.
Before dinner, Peter investigated a point that bothered him: Bill used the term “Service” in an
unusual way. He wrote: “Acme computing will run the trust rating service for
semanticweb.org” (a sentence from Bill). His assistant found no problem so he hit: “service”,
the assistant displayed “service in {database} equivalentTo: infrastructure.”. Peter asked for
“metainfo”, which raised “Updated today by negotiating with Bill’s assistant.” Peter again
asked for “Arguments!”: “Service in {database} conflicts with service in {web}”. “Explain!”
“In operating system and database, the term services covers features like fault-tolerance, cache,
security, that we are used to put in the infrastructure. More evidence?”.
Peter was glad he had not to search the whole web for an explanation of this. The two
assistants detected the issue and negotiated silently a solution to this problem. He had some
time left before getting to the théatre de la ville. His assistant made the miracle to book him a
place for a rare show of Anne-Theresa De Keermaeker’s troupe in Paris. It had to resort to a
particular web service that it found through a dance-related common interest pool of assistants.
The service workflow had been acquired by one of the fanatic’s assistant during his use of the
service. He had accepted to share his know-how with his fellow amateurs.
Peter put his assistant to rest (or rather, he notified his assistant that he wanted to rest) and went
with a free mind to look for a nice place to eat in the warm spring evening. In fact, he never
leaves his assistant choosing the wine for him.
Requirements
The scenario involves a lot of technology: powerful personal assistants, wireless connectivity,
knowledge exchange and negotiation protocols. This technology does not call for outstanding
research. The natural development of technology will provide them soon and some programs
(such as the idea of ambient intelligence) have them as goal.
It also requires a lot of data and a lot of knowledge accessible to computers. This is the
semantic web idea. Having this data and knowledge available is certainly a great challenge for
the semantic web development.
Aside from these sources, this scenario requires some mechanisms that will help people trust
and use these systems. These mechanisms are mainly:
—  a model for protecting data from unauthorised use (e.g., “the woman from Québec”,
disclosing the service workflow);
20
—  a model for trusting the data (e.g., “trust the university site more than the personal
vCard, trust publishers’ journal tables more than personal list of publications, ask for an
evaluation of the merit of this information by the person to who it is meant”);
— an ability to filter information from trust and relevance model and to explain the results;
—  the ability to negotiate with other agents the ontology content (e.g., the two assistants
have exhibited a peer-to-peer ontology synchronisation on the terms at hand).
Knowledge management
Nowadays, knowledge is one of the most crucial success factors for enterprises. Therefore,
Knowledge Management (KM) has been identified as a strategically important means for
enterprises. Clearly, KM is an interdisciplinary task, including human resource management,
enterprise organisation and culture as well as IT technology. However, there is a widespread
consensus that IT technology plays an important role as an enabler for many aspects of a KM
solution.
In the past, IT technology for knowledge management has focused on the management of
knowledge containers using text documents as the main repository and source of knowledge. In
the future, semantic web technology, especially ontologies and machine-processable relational
metadata, pave the way to KM solutions that are based on semantically related knowledge
pieces of different granularity: Ontologies define a shared conceptualisation of the application
domain at hand and provide the basis for defining metadata that have a precisely defined
semantics and are therefore machine-processable. Although first KM approaches and solutions
have shown the benefits of ontologies and related methods there still exists a large number of
open research issues that have to be addressed in order to make semantic web technologies a
complete success for KM solutions:
Industrial KM applications have to avoid any kind of overhead as far as possible. Therefore, a
seamless integration of knowledge creation, e.g. content and metadata specification, and
knowledge access, e.g. querying or browsing, into the working environment is required.
Strategies and methods are needed that support the creation of knowledge as side effects of
activities that are carried out anyway. This requires means for emergent semantics, e.g.
through ontology learning, which reduces the overhead of building-up and maintaining
ontologies.
Access to, as well as presentation of, knowledge has to be context-dependent. Since the
context is set-up by the current business task and thus by the business process being handled, a
tight integration of business process management and knowledge management is required. KM
approaches being able to manage knowledge pieces provide a promising starting point for
smart push services that will proactively deliver relevant knowledge for carrying out the task at
hand.
Contextualisation has to be supplemented by personalization. Taking into account the
experience of the user and his or her personal needs is a prerequisite, on the one hand, for
avoiding information overload and, on the other hand, for delivering knowledge on the right
level of granularity.
21
The development of knowledge portals serving the needs of companies or communities is still
a more or less manual process. Ontologies and related metadata provide a promising
conceptual basis for generating parts of such knowledge portals. Obviously, conceptual models
of the domain, the users and the tasks are needed among others. Generation of knowledge
portals has to be supplemented with the (semi-)automatic evolution of portals. Since business
environments and strategies change rather rapidly, KM portals have to be kept up-to-date in
this fast changing environment. Evolution of portals also includes the aspect of “forgetting”
outdated knowledge.
KM solutions will be based on a combination of intranet-based and mobile functions in the
very near future. Semantic web technologies are a promising approach to meet the needs of the
mobile environments, like e.g. location-aware personalization and adaptation of the
presentation to the specific needs of mobile devices, i.e. the presentation of the required
information at an appropriate level of granularity. In essence, employees should have access to
the KM application anywhere and anytime.
Peer-to-Peer computing combined with semantic web technology will be an interesting path
to get rid of the more centralised KM solutions that are currently implied by ontology-based
solutions. P2P scenarii open up the way to derive consensual conceptualisations among
employees within an enterprise in a bottom-up manner.
Virtual organisations become more and more important in business scenarios that are
characterised by decentralisation and globalisation. Obviously, semantic interoperability
between different knowledge sources as well as trust is a must in inter-organisational KM
applications.
The integration of KM applications, e.g. skill management, with e-learning is an important
field enabling a lot of synergy between these two areas. KM solutions and e-learning have to
be integrated from both an organisational and an IT point of view. Clearly, interoperability
and/or integration of (metadata) standards are needed to realise such integration.
Knowledge management is obviously a very promising area for exploiting semantic web
technology. Document-based KM solutions have already reached their limits, whereas
semantic technologies open the way to meet the KM requirements of the future.

Languages and inferences
Scope of inquiry
As stated in the introduction, “languages are necessary for expressing the content of the
semantic web”, and the semantics of these languages are exploited by inference engines.
In the young history of the semantic web, research and development on languages to support
the semantic web has been perhaps one of the most active areas so far. Results in this area have
been leading the other areas required for the semantic web, and this is indeed appropriate: the
presence of well-defined languages is a necessary prerequisite for the interoperability that is
the key issue of the semantic web.
This means that a first proposal for a set of semantic web languages is in place (XML, RDF,
RDF Schema, DAML+OIL, the latter being subject to standardisation by a W3C working
group). However, this is only a very first step.
The scope of the work on “languages for the semantic web” is much more than deciding on a
standardised syntax alone. Besides a standardised syntax, a precise semantics is also required.
Because the languages are intended for interoperability between machines, we cannot rely on
an implicit shared understanding of terms between humans with a shared linguistic and cultural
background. Instead, the semantics of these languages must be formally defined. These
semantics can be defined in multiple forms: current proposals for semantic web languages have
used a model-theoretic and axiomatic form for specifying the semantics. Other forms are
possible, such as operational semantics.
Major research questions
Here we identify a number of major research questions which have not been solved yet by the
current efforts in this area, and which need urgent attention.
Multiplicity of languages
Different languages apply to different situations. Some applications require expressive
languages with expensive computational costs, while others need simple languages. Figure 2
displays various languages that could be used in the semantic web. It is important that
application designers are guided in the choice of language that is most appropriate to their task.
Research should be carried out on the following lines:
—  Designing languages that stack easily or at least that can be combined and compared
easily. The design of DAML+OIL has shown this path. This stacking needs to apply not
only to syntax, but also to semantics, inference procedures, partial interpretability, etc.
—  Make explicit the relations between the languages and which needs they can fulfil, so
that application developers can choose the appropriate language.

Figure 2. A set of languages that are available for implementing the semantic web.
The language-stack (such as the one depicted in figure 2) should enable both a low step-in cost
(possible to participate at a low cost with limited functionality) and a high ceiling (possible to
expand into powerful functionality at increased costs).
Somewhat in contrast to the above, the current situation suffers from rather an explosion of
languages. The XML language alone is really a family of standards (XML, XSL, XSLT,
XPath, XPointer, XLink, XQuery, etc), and a similar explosion is now threatening to happen at
every subsequent layer (RDF, DAML+OIL). At some point in the future, a shakeout and
reconciliation of many of these separate languages will be required.
Reconciling different modelling styles
Different communities in different situations adopt different knowledge modelling styles:
axioms (from logic), objects (from software engineering), constraints (from artificial
intelligence), view-queries (from databases). It is important to know how to combine these
modelling styles and how to implement one style into another. This is partly a technical process
(requiring translations between the different modelling paradigms), but it is also large a social
process, where different communities must be educated about the benefits and limitations of
their own modelling styles, and those from others.
Different reasoning services
As with languages, different reasoning services are required by different applications. These
can vary in substance or quality requirement. Examples of different reasoning services are:
— querying consequences of a domain description,
— checking for consistency,
— matching between two separate descriptions,
— determining the degree of similarity between descriptions,
— detecting cycles and other possible anomalies,
— classifying instances in a given hierarchy,
— etc.
All these different reasoning service can be executed with different requirements on their
quality and cost:
—  exact and complete reasoning (only feasible for limited applications, or safety critical
ones),
25
—  approximate inferences which give incomplete answers in a much shorter time than it
would take to compute complete answers (these are important for large scale
applications, or applications under time constraints),
—  anytime inference algorithms which can be interrupted at “any time”, giving the best
available answer at that time (in this case users can make their own trade-off between
the time they want to wait and the quality of the answer they want to have),
—  resource-bounded reasoning, where the quality of the answer is determined by the
amount of resources that are allocated to the computation in advance.
Traces of much relevant work on all these issues can be found in artificial intelligence and
software engineering but not in a form that they are already practically applicable to semantic
web applications.
Identity
When addressing and reasoning about objects and individuals that occur on the web and in the
world, there is of course a need to identify them. This requires first of giving all individuals
non-ambiguous names. The current web has made a large step by introducing a globally unique
naming scheme through uniform resource identifiers (URI) whose more prominent
instantiation are uniform resource locators (URL) used on the web. However, besides giving
unique names, it must also be possible to identify when two separate names actually refer to
the same object in the world. We must be able to state such identities and use them in further
processing. Major questions that play a role here are:
— Formal semantics of URI identity (how a URI must be interpreted);
— Scope of the equality statements (i.e., anything more subtle than simply world wide);
— Rigid designators and temporal identity (i.e., names that refer to the same role although
fulfilled by different entities, such as “the president of the United States”).
Modularity
The semantic web can only get off the ground through large-scale re-use of resources. Re-use
of ontologies and service descriptions must provide leverage for the growth of the semantic
web. However, current re-use is only possible through a complete import of somebody else’s
ontology. Even if one would want to reuse only a tiny fraction of some large ontology,
currently one is obliged to import the entire ontology, with obvious drawback for maintenance
and computational efficiency. Much more sophisticated modularity concepts have been
investigated in software engineering, both for data-structures and for program-constructs.
Similar mechanism must be developed for the semantic web as a matter of urgency.
Recommendations for future research
By its very nature, the work on standardising languages for the semantic web is not only a
technical but also a social process.
It is important to emphasise cross-Atlantic collaboration, and even expanding this into
collaboration with Asia and Australia. The current funding models make it difficult in practice
to get funding for projects with partners disseminated across America, Europe, Japan or
Australia. This is a severe limiting factor on the work on establishing world-wide standards.
Explicit funding must also be available for the required follow-up processes after a standard
has been defined. These include the development of teaching material, PR activities, training at
both academic, technical and management levels, dissemination workshops, etc.
26
Many of these activities do not lend themselves very well for to a project-oriented funding
scheme, and other models should be considered.
27
Infrastructure
Scope of inquiry
The web is a combination of an infrastructure (provided by the IP and HTTP protocols) and a
language (HTML). A currently open question concerns the need for a specific infrastructure for
the semantic web that could be provided by modifying the actual web protocols or by other
specific protocols (or conservative extensions of the actual protocol).
The infrastructure does not have to provide ontologies, transformations and inference engines
repositories. But it would be better to have a standard way to approach these repositories on the
semantic web. The design of an infrastructure has to answer to a set of questions that are
considered below:
— How should semantic web resources be identified and located?
— What computation is carried out to support applications?
— Can interoperability be supported by a transformation infrastructure?
— What protection of knowledge must be offered?
— How to guarantee safe computation?
— How computers can choose which knowledge source to trust?
Our initial scope of investigation was named “infrastructure and services”. We found that the
term “service” was used, in the database and system field, for what several participants call
“infrastructure” and that the word “service” was used in the web field as a synonym for a
“server” in the client-server philosophy.  In the semantic web, the word “service” has been
extended to any application on the web (just like the common life term “service”).
So the focus of the discussion below in called “infrastructure” but it covers what is usually
called service in other fields (e.g., transactions, security, authentication). We will talk below of
the semantic web infrastructure, even if it can be disconnected.
It can be remarked that the questions considered here are questions that can be raised about the
current web. So what new does the semantic web brings to these questions? The answer is
inference. As soon as the web has gathered some kind of semantics that is accounted for by the
computers, they must draw the inferences that are sanctioned by the semantics.
Built-in semantics considerations shed new light on the considered questions, because a
syntactic check for confidentiality, for instance, is not enough. The computer should not just
check that a classified piece of information is not communicated, but that it is not deducible!
What was before devoted to the classifying authority can be left to the computer because it can
access the semantics.
The questions now become very complex ones that will require strong involvement of several
research communities in order to progress significantly. However, such progress should be
invaluable, because this task once done by computers should be better handled.
Major research questions
Localisation and identification
A point strongly debated in the semantic web arena is that of identification of the concepts or
objects considered. In the current web, URIs identifies resources. While lack of identity
reference is not problematic on the current web, it becomes problematic in a formal web
28
(where one assert that there is only one planet at one position and has to reconcile the morning
and the evening stars).
The problems here can sound philosophical ones, but they have a concrete impact on the
building of the semantic web. The debated issues are:
— How to establish object identity: the fact that the URI structure is strongly decentralised
(anyone can create an URI) means that there can be several URIs for the same resource.
This is not really a problem when locating a resource, but becomes a problem when
reasoning about the objects (especially with cardinality).
—  URIs are often used as proxies. They are locators for a web site (that of “W3C”),
designators for a real world entity (the World Wide Web consortium), namespace for
programs (developed at W3C)… It is not easy to determine from context what the URI
identifies and this is really a problem both for locating and reasoning. In practice there
is negotiation when accessing but this negotiation does not occur, so far, when
reasoning.
—  The URIs are used in some recent works for identifying “real-world” objects (on the
web). Since no one can “access” these real-world objects, all the features provided by
accessibility (negotiation) are lost. Due to the decentralised nature of URI definition,
there is no rule for identification (not one URI for identifying “W3C”). It will be very
useful to have a normalised way to address that object without having to resort on a
centralised resource. If a solution is found for that problem, there is no limitation to its
application to abstract notions (e.g., to the concept of limit).
— The web infrastructure is based on a very rustic naming model. However, names are not
tied to concepts and there can be several parallel models. Once the semantic web will
not be restricted to web resources but must encompass real-world ones, it would be
useful to disconnect concept identifiers from concept names. People could then call
identifiable concepts with different names depending on context (company, language,
etc.). The naming model of Topic Maps allows this. There is a need to adapt it to the
semantic web languages.
—  Knowing that web resources exist is not enough for processing: they must be located
and available. There is a need for getting web resources: “where can I find a knowledge
base about France”, “what can book me a flight to Sophia-Antipolis” are meta-questions
that the agents will have to ask. Getting the answer necessitates kinds of registry. There
can be peer-to-peer connections, centralised registry (UDDI), and multiple registries,
search services or combination of these. The infrastructure must support this (and the
agent must at least know a search service that can answer its question and will scale).
The infrastructure of the semantic web will have to answer to these questions in order to define
a well-grounded model.
Processing model
The semantic web could easily consume a large amount of resources for querying the web,
computing consequences and storing them. It is thus necessary to take into account from the
architectural point of view several requirements that will help to support this:
— Storage, caching, optimisation, query…
— Distribution of the computation on many computers if necessary.
—  Transactions: web services require that several actions are performed in a unique
transaction.
29
These actions traditionally resort to system and are largely considered by work on grid
computing. However, the semantic web infrastructure must perform some inference for
supporting applications in a more efficient way. For instance, caching could depend on the
content; distribution can depend on the use of the inferences that are performed. The question
is: How much must be left to applications and how much must be provided by the
infrastructure.
This is the same kind of dilemma as the one that arose in multi-agent systems with regard to
agent communication languages: how much semantics must be put in the content and how
much must be put in the performatives. The agent community has found a fragile equilibrium
on that topic. The same should be achieved in the context of the semantic web.
Semantic transformations
The knowledge will be available on the web under many different forms (languages) and under
different modelling (axiomatisation). Moreover, some applications will need to adapt the
knowledge found on the web. Adaptation is already at work for the current web. The current
web solves that problem by writing wrappers or guesses, which are always written in an adhoc
manner. It is expected that the semantic web will help building these tools because it will
provide the semantic-based answer to a query instead of a structure-based answer.
It is necessary, for taking advantage of the available knowledge to be able to transform it and
import it under particular processing environments (which require different granularities or
extent). This task is better taken into account within the infrastructure than individually in each
context. There are several tools that the infrastructure can provide.
First, the crucial need is to be able to merge ontologies for integrating data. This can be
achieved through transformations and articulation theories (which express a theory in terms of
another). The infrastructure could provide a way to find these resources (i.e. be able to identify
them from a description of the problem) and to assemble them. This could be achieved through
the development of transformation services (mediators) and libraries of transformations.
However not all transformations are suited to every task. The transformations can be
characterised by the properties they satisfy (like preserving meaning, weakening structure, or
filtering information). When a transformation is needed for a target, it is required to satisfy
such particular properties. This model is general enough for being applicable to simple
extraction from databases as well as complex ontology merging with change of granularity and
languages. A first research effort should provide characterisation of transformations in terms of
useful properties and providing general schemes for expressing these transformations and
properties in languages that the machine can understand.
These properties cannot be taken for granted as soon as they are assigned to a transformation.
A suspicious program might want to have more grounded reasons to use a transformation. For
that purpose, it will need a proof that the transformation satisfies the advertised property. It will
then be able to check that proof and process the transformation.
Let’s take the example of ontology versioning. It is very dangerous to use a knowledge base
with a new version of the ontology. However if the ontology maintainers provide a
transformation from old to new versions, it becomes possible to use an old knowledge base
once transformed with the new ontology (and other new resources).
So, the infrastructure could take in charge the localisation of transformations, their properties
and their proofs, the checking of the proofs and the composition of new transformations.
Research is of course needed on transformation composition, proof-carrying transformations,
proof languages and proof-checkers.
30
Knowledge protection
The semantic web will use deduction capabilities to derive far fetching conclusions about
information not explicitly provided by people. This will help providing better services to users.
This strength of the semantic web can be a threat for privacy. People will not use the semantic
web if they think that it can break their privacy and providers will not develop for the semantic
web if people do not use it!
This problem can be solved if service providers express their policy (what do they do with data
and knowledge that are communicated to them) and users their preferences (what do they want
to communicate at what condition). The W3C has supported the development of the P3P and
CC/PP languages just for that purpose. Yet these kinds of languages are based on specific
expressions related to the current use of web sites. The expressive power brought by the
semantic web should enable to express very precisely policies and preferences and its
deductive power should ease the deduction of consequences of particular agreements.
A protocol for matching policies and preferences is needed for guaranteeing that users can
communicate data with the best possible insurance. It is needed for service providers to reach
the customer base they deserve.
Spreading knowledge all over the web is useful because it can help solve problems and provide
services. However, some actors might want to protect knowledge for various reasons (mainly
because it provides them a competitive advantage). Some others might want to distribute it on a
commercial basis or want their contribution to be acknowledged. There is a need for access
control and right management. There exist general techniques for achieving this, but, in the
context of a semantic web, knowledge can be more difficult to protect because what is not
explicitly stated can be deduced. Research is needed in efficiently protecting knowledge:
disclosing some knowledge and being certain that some other knowledge cannot be deduced
from it.
Robustness, safety, and trust
In the human-browsable web, clicking on a dangling link can only trigger a 404 error and the
browsing human, while upset is able to recover and to look somewhere else (let aside
correcting the ill-formed URLs). In a machine-readable web, many characteristics of the
searched resource can alter the performance of the machine: version, trust level, language,
mathematical properties, cost of use, authentication. Although an altered human-readable web
page is still readable by human, any of the reason to not meet the expectation of a program is a
cause for failure. Bus error is the less hurting solution because we will then know that
something went wrong. More malicious is the absence of clash when using bogus knowledge…
The infrastructure requires being able to provide quality of service. While this is a well-known
term, it will now depend on other parameters than those usually measured. The methods for
achieving this quality of service are similar to those actually used (certified methods based on
proofs and authority, robust methods based on statistic and rough computation). They will have
to be enhanced with knowledge of the parameters that can affect the task (for instance, if I
spend all the money available for this task on search, I will not have anymore money on
deducing).
The semantic web being processed mainly by machines cannot depend only on the user for
trusting or not the site content. It will have to decide if a particular resource found on the web
31
is trustworthy before using it. Trustworthiness concerns many aspects of the resource: the
fiability of a program, the correctness of the content, etc.
Trust can be established in many ways including proving that the resource satisfies the required
property, applying trust propagation mechanisms based either on indices (how many sites refer
to this one, how many papers cite this one), trust assertions from other trusted parties (non
formal arguments à la epinions.com or formal argumentation systems), semantic arguments
(involving reasoning about the issue).
As an example, let’s come back to the Ontology version problem. If the maintainers publish a
checkable proof of the transformation between two versions of their ontology, it becomes
possible to trust the transformation. Moreover, if we have a certificate from a trusted party that
the initial ontology satisfies properties that we expect, then the program will be able to derive
that it can trust the transformed knowledge and use it for its own purposes.
However, trust is not an all-or-nothing property: one can be more or less confident in an
assertion. So the trust representations and models have to be context dependent. For achieving
this, the semantic web will have to rely on a trust propagation model that helps evaluate the
reasons for trusting and the way these reasons can be combined.
Recommendations for future research
From an infrastructure viewpoint, the key point is to design an infrastructure that:
— scales,
— does not commit to a specific model (of trust, rights, properties, etc.);
— proves to be usable.
To that respects we identified the future research directions at three levels.
Work on models:
— trust,
— identity,
— properties.
Work on tools:
— for localising and matching resources,
— for checking proofs and policies,
— for propagating trust, proofs and rewards.
Experimentation:
— proof-carrying transformations (processing and composing),
— trust propagation,
— right management,
— robustness (to openness, fuzziness, granularity mismatches, etc.).
An additional specific recommendation of this working group is the support of open source
development of high quality components and of a non-profit shelter organisation for this
software.

33
Ontologies
Scope of inquiry
An ontology is a formal conceptualisation of a domain that is usable by a computer. This
involves an explicit description of the assumptions regarding both the domain structure and the
terms used to describe the domain. Ontologies are central to the semantic web because they
allow applications to agree on the terms that they use when communicating. They are a key
factor for enabling interoperability in the semantic web.
Ontologies will have to grow and develop with the semantic web and this needs support.
Several open questions related to the development of ontologies are considered here.
Major research questions
The research questions have been divided into ontology development methodology, major
theoretical issues, needs for strategic ontologies, and requirements for better tools.
Ontology lifecycle
Ontologies aim at modelling and structuring domain knowledge that provides a commonly
agreed understanding of a domain, which may be reused and shared across applications and
groups of people. As for any professional software artefact, their employment in real-life
applications requires comprehensive engineering methodologies that need to cover all the
aspects of an ontology’s lifecycle. Thus, the lifecycle contains several phases, ranging from
requirements analysis and initial ontology design to conceptual refinement, evaluation and, last
but not least, evolution (see Figure 3).
 
Figure 3: Ontology lifecycle
The engineering of ontologies starts with a requirements analysis. This is a crucial step since
the ontology for a domain does not exist, rather various ontologies might be developed
depending on the specific requirements of the applications and users. Obviously, methods
related to requirements engineering, e.g. competency questions, may be applied for that
purpose as well, however specific aspects that are to be addressed are requirements like
richness, i.e. the question of how detailed the domain should be modelled, coverage, i.e. the
breadth of the ontology, cognitive adequacy, i.e. what are structures and concepts that fit to the
needs of prospective users. A key issue here is the balance between specificity and reusability:
this seems to be especially relevant in the semantic web perspective, since the users of an
ontology may not be known in advance.
Based on the requirements specification the initial ontology design may be approached. An
important topic here is the analysis of various kinds of knowledge sources, i.e. free texts, semi-
34
structured sources and structured sources like databases. Here ontology learning, i.e. the
combination of linguistic analysis, information extraction, statistical techniques and machine
learning is a very challenging, yet promising area of research. When exploiting multimedia
sources, text analysis techniques have to be supplemented with picture and video analysis
techniques. During initial design, too, reusability is a specifically tough aspect that has to be
addressed.
The output of the initial design step, i.e. some preliminary conceptual structures, may directly
feed into the next step, viz. the conceptual refinement. To support efficient and effective
refinement, semi-automatic means for restructuring and enriching data are needed that exploit
already existing conceptual sources, like thesauri, database schemata, upper-level ontologies or
further domain specific ontologies; this means that ontology learning is an important method
for conceptual refinement as well. Formal ontological principles guiding the definition,
modification and enrichment of conceptual structures have to be specified in a way that they
are applicable in practical settings. Reuse of parts of ontologies asks for appropriate structuring
principles, i.e. modularization concepts that support composition links between ontology
modules that are more sophisticated than just “import”.
In many cases, this refinement process needs to be supported by tools and methods for
consensus building and for comparing and analysing the implications of different conceptual
views. Unfortunately, there is a lack of tools and techniques in this area. Furthermore, in a lot
of application scenarios the alignment of different ontologies might be much more appropriate
than the integration of different ontologies into a single target ontology. Again, semi-automatic
means that handle syntactic and semantic aspects are of high importance in order to lower the
overhead of that alignment process. In dynamic applications scenarios, like e.g. mobile
applications, “alignment on the fly” is a promising, yet not well understood approach.
During refinement and evolution (see below) of ontologies aspects of sloppiness have to be
taken into account as well. Whereas existing methods aim at delivering precisely defined
ontologies, application scenarios, e.g. peer-to-peer based applications, might be confident with
ontologies and alignment of ontologies that are to some extent sloppy. However, there do not
exist methods for addressing these sloppiness aspects.
The evaluation phase needs ways of formally evaluating an ontology with respect to its
requirements. Many different dimensions can be assessed by evaluation: psychological
adequacy, usage evaluation, deepness, agreement between ontologies, etc. Moreover, the
evaluation can be performed in situation (i.e. in a particular application) or in abstracto (in an
ideally neutral way). One may distinguish between different kinds of evaluation scenarii, e.g.
the evaluation of the usage of the ontology in different applications and by different users, or,
experiments for checking the psychological adequacy of certain ontological choices.
Theoretical means, i.e. metrics, are needed for comparing different ontologies according to
their expressivity, accuracy, domain richness and cognitive adequacy, to name but a few
aspects.
In the real world, things are changing, and so do ontologies. To handle the evolution and
maintenance of ontologies, one needs to explore and to formalise the kinds of relationships that
may arise between different ontology versions. A productive versioning management includes
also the recognition of change needs by checking the usage patterns of ontologies and by semi-
automatically exploring newly available sources with respect to not yet modelled concepts and
35
relations. Usage patterns may also indicate that some ontology parts have become outdated.
Last but not least, these changes need somehow to be propagated to the metadata produced
according to each ontology, i.e. to the annotations, in order to guarantee consistent and up-to-
date metadata annotations.
Theoretical issues
Several theoretical issues concerning ontology development are still open, and require to be
addressed for an effective use of ontologies in the semantic web. A first need concerns the
definition of formal ontological principles, general criteria to be used to impose a discipline
on the ontology development process and make possible to compare different ontological
criteria on a rigorous and neutral basis. Related to this, there is the need for developing libraries
of foundational ontologies, describing (and relating together) basic modelling choices related
to general issues like the ontology of time, space, events, and objects. What we envision, in this
respect, is not so much a monolithic top-level ontology to be used by all applications (an
unrealistic and naïve perspective), but rather the possibility of making explicit the nature and
the content of ontological choices simply by committing to specific foundational modules,
whose characteristics and implications are already well understood (although not necessarily
agreed upon) by a large community. In this way, the ontological commitment of a certain
theory could be “certified” in a way similar to what happens for other engineering artefacts.
More generally, the challenge for the next years is the development of a unified conceptual
analysis methodology which considers all the methodological efforts that have been
developed in computer science (for database systems, object-oriented systems, knowledge-
based systems, etc.) in the light of common ontological principles.
Finally, specific issues especially relevant for the semantic web are related to the notion of
identity (already mentioned above), and to the notions of relevance and granularity, necessary
to cope with multiple conceptualisations.
Strategic domains for ontology development
Besides the general foundational ontologies discussed above, more specific ontologies need to
be developed to support the semantic web activities. The main ontologies whose development
must be supported are:
—  Ontology of information and information processing: this involves the semantic web
infrastructure, as well as the relationships between such infrastructure and the real
world (semiotic relations, among other things),
— Ontology of social entities: this mainly involves the ontology of people, organisations,
and laws,
—  Ontology of social co-operation and interaction: this involves the various ways of
interactions among human and artificial agents and organisations.
Requirements for tools and methods
Building and especially maintaining ontologies will require tools and methodologies. Some
requirements on these are listed below:
—  Visualisation of complex ontologies is an important issue because it is easy to be
overwhelmed by the complexity of ontologies. Moreover, tools should be able to
36
provide comparative displays of different ontologies (or ontology versions). Specific
tools based on the objective semantics and the perceived meaning should be developed.
—  Cooperative development environments should support consensus building and the
comparison of different conceptual views or degree of consensus.
—  Managing argumentation and design rationale can be thought of as part of the above.
Design rationales should be attached to ontologies so that the application developers
(and, maybe, the applications) can use them to choose the adequate ontology.
— Support for modularity and transformation of ontologies by recording the links between
modules and proposing transformations to export part of ontologies in a context with
specific requirements. This can be based on the results of the “inter-ontology linking”
and “evolution” parts above.
Recommendations for future research
—  Ontology acquisition from multiple primary sources (texts, multimedia, images) by
means of learning techniques,
— Ontology comparison, merging, versioning, conceptual refinement, and evaluation,
—  Formal ontological principles as a basis for a unified conceptual modelling
methodology
— Theoretical issues about identity,
— Libraries of foundational ontologies simplifying the documentation of basic ontological
choices,
—  Development of specific ontologies in strategic domains: information and information
processing, social entities, social co-operation and interaction.
37
Human factors
Scope of inquiry
We use the general term Human Interfaces to cover:
— User Interfaces to single- and multi-user applications: the software and hardware with
which people interact to communicate with a semantic web technology.
—  Community/Organisational Interfaces—the broader interaction that organisational
and other groups have with semantic web applications: the factors that make sustained
adoption of such technologies more likely, and the impact that it has on their work
practices, and their perceptions of the technology.
Major research questions
Sustained use of technologies in authentic work contexts
The semantic web, like so many other technology research areas, is strong on innovation (e.g.
small scale, short-term prototypes), and weak on longer-term evaluation. Whilst this is a
function of the immaturity of many systems, as the infrastructure stabilises a sign of its
maturity will be cases demonstrating sustained use of technologies in authentic work contexts,
in order to understand how the tools and user communities co-evolve into an effective work
system.
This should be a research priority, and implies the need to draw in researchers from
communities such as human-computer interaction, computer-supported collaborative work, and
social informatics.
Growth models for the semantic web
The web exploded so rapidly in size because the cost-benefit trade-off was right. Untrained
people could see the benefits of publishing, and were able to learn by example well enough to
get going rapidly with HTML. However, the cost-benefit trade-off may be very different for
the semantic web.
A number of research questions and possibilities emerge on this matter:
— Mimic the Web. Can the semantic web exploit the Web’s explosive “copy-edit-paste”
model? Can some of the benefits of semantic web technologies be spread rapidly to the
“wild web” at large?  What would it mean to copy-edit-paste RDF from one person’s
page to your own? What services would be needed to support the creation of coherent
RDF when it is transplanted? What mark-up tools can assist people in moving existing
web sites into the “semantic” world?
—  Don’t try to mimic the Web. Is it appropriate to even try to mimic this? Will the
reality be multiple, but relatively small semantic webs, within trusted communities who
have consensus on worldview and purpose, with “professional” level codification. In
this view, the semantic web is very different to the web that we currently know.
—  Hybrid model. The “copy-edit-paste” model will work within communities who
subscribe to a particular set of semantic web services. This is how semantic web literacy
will spread.
— Supporting the spectrum of developers and users. It is well established from studies
of end-user communities that a spectrum of expertise emerges, from expert developers,
via “tinkerers” and “gardeners” who can make minor changes, to passive consumers
38
who do not modify their environment in any way. What tools are needed to help foster
such communities of practice around semantic web applications?
Next generation application development environments
Developers of semantic web applications are a crucial class of “end user” who need to be
considered. Knowledge modelling and the design of reasoning services are conducted in
impoverished environments at present. Since there is already a large “installed base” of web
developers who are used to integrated development environments, one argument is that they
can be helped in making the transition to building semantic web applications if intelligible
languages and effective design tools are provided.
This research effort needs to draw on the significant body of knowledge already built on the
psychology of programming (e.g. cognitive processes; software visualisation; debugging tools).
Examples:
—  The HTML model. We have seen how HTML tools have evolved from editors to
sophisticated layout and site management environments. What are the requirements of
semantic web developers?
—  Implications for languages? The semantic web is often conveyed as a set of layers,
each with its own formalisms. Whilst this “layered cake” model may not be the best
way to communicate the vision, it is undeniable that the infrastructure is complex, and
this is an adoption barrier. Developers need support in managing the baroque range of
languages. Many now work with XML, and there is some evidence that they want to
“stick with what they know” rather than learn, for instance, RDF. A research challenge,
therefore, is to better understand how “non semantic” web developers perceive the
semantic web, and explore strategies for delivering its functionality in “palatable” ways.
What can we learn from the successes and failures in efforts to establish other common
languages/standards?
“Incidental” knowledge capture (i.e. automatic metadata generation and knowledge base
population)
The semantic web depends on large amounts of well-structured data (i.e. at an appropriate
granularity, appropriately classified and linked), whether this is basic metadata or ontology-
based in a more systematic, formal sense. Knowledge capture is therefore a challenge of the
first order. Whilst knowledge engineers, librarians and information scientists can do this work,
they are in short supply. If we draw inspiration from the Web’s explosive growth, a strategy is
to make non-specialists part of the codification effort.  However, it is an established fact that
“normal” people neither like, nor have the time or skills, to create metadata in their busy lives
(how many of us bother for own our documents or web sites?). This is even more the case for
designing and populating coherent ontologies. Formalised knowledge capture is an “unnatural
act” for most people.
The term “incidental” refers to the goal of generating metadata, and semantic annotation, as a
by-product of people’s normal work activities. Ideally, they will simply do their work, and
smart technologies will “capture” the product and process in useful ways. The challenge is to
develop strategies that match different domains, user groups and tasks that maximise the
quality of knowledge capture with minimum effort on the part of users.
Although “pure” incidental knowledge capture is the goal, in reality this is often impossible.
Assuming some changes are necessary in individual or group behaviour, the cost-benefit trade-
off must be negotiated successfully to demonstrate uptake. If training is required because the
39
tools are so novel, then again, the cost-benefit trade-off must be negotiated: the training has to
be shown to be valued by the trainees, and effective.
Example strategies:
— When aspects of the work domain can be usefully modelled (e.g. tasks, roles, artefacts,
states, workflow, user goals), agents may be able to monitor the online activities of
single users or groups, and automatically or semi-automatically generate metadata
based on context. Specific challenges include evaluations of the integrity of such
modelling techniques, and the design of agent user interfaces that do not intrude, can be
integrated into everyday environments, and help users to review and refine what is
being captured so that they trust the system.
—  Much knowledge-intensive activity is not conducted via computers, e.g. individuals
talking on the phone, or in meetings. Assuming there is information worth capturing,
approaches to explore in these contexts include technologies for tracking document use
and the co-location of individuals, and capturing significant events in planned and
unplanned conversations/meetings. Again, the emphasis is on enabling people to do
their work with minimal disruption, and to prove that knowledge capture augmentation
is possible.
Understanding the use of metadata
We need to better understand how metadata is created and used in practice.
Examples:
—  “Articulation work” is a term from the study of work practices that refers to the
processes involved in actually using an artefact, such as a formal classification scheme,
as part of work activities. Such analyses often demonstrate that groups negotiate
amongst themselves conventions for the application of such schemes. This knowledge
needs to be brought to bear on semantic web applications as they emerge.
— Mechanisms need to be found to support the layering of metadata on resources. There
may be many types of metadata from multiple perspectives, authors and agents, with
varying access rights.
— “Dressing and undressing” objects with metadata/roles. There are fashions in metadata.
Since metadata is designed to support resource discovery, maintaining a digital
presence (e.g. to funding bodies or management) implies that as vocabulary shifts,
metadata must adapt. In the economy of attention, if one’s own resources don’t show up
“near the top” of a search, they may remain invisible.
—  Binding metadata to objects. In some domains (such as bio-informatics) objects are
passed around many people, who may annotate them. It is crucial to devise trusted
methods to bind metadata to objects to ensure that history, dependencies, and ownership
is preserved (with obvious implications for issues such as patent rights).
Coping with “messy metadata” (from people and machines)
When untrained people and imperfect machines are generating metadata or populating
ontologies, the results will be “messy”. Depending on the context (e.g. the criticality of
maintaining high quality capture), three non-exclusive strategies are:
—  Avoid it. The cost of incorrect metadata is too high (e.g. medicine or safety-critical
applications).
— Tolerate it. The cost-benefit trade-off is good enough that imperfections do not disrupt
system utility.
40
— Clean it. This may be a cooperative process between humans and intelligent agents, or
a purely discursive process, e.g. expert conferences to decide on a new taxonomy, or
how to codify new discoveries. The latter (found in some areas of bio-informatics) is an
interesting example of how new organisational infrastructure will evolve around the
semantic web as it takes root in a community.
How to support collaborative, emergent consensus?
Ontologies are generally designed by a small group of experts, in order to ensure consistency,
coverage, etc.  However, there is another niche of semantic web applications for those domains
in which there is insufficient consensus to declare an ontology. In such situations, particularly
in networked communities, the semantic web may be able to play a role in supporting emergent
consensus by providing tools for collective sensemaking that tolerate inconsistency, ambiguity,
incompleteness, and other such characteristics normally eliminated from ontologies and
metadata.
Examples:
—  The domain is dynamic. This is typical of many real world problems, which are
subject to constant change due to unpredictable environmental factors. This can raise
the cost of maintaining the ontology so high that it is not worth the effort.
Representational schemes, methods and tools for ontology evolution and propagation of
changes have contributions to make in this context.
— The domain is contested. A domain may have been studied for a long time, but be still
partially understood, and from multiple perspectives. The classic example is the
scientific/scholarly research field in which resolving disagreement on domain
boundaries, concept distinctions and status is the defining activity of the stakeholders.
Representational schemes, methods and tools to support such discourse/argumentation
have contributions to make in this context.
How to maintain and analyse history?
Understanding the history behind a resource is often critical to understanding how to use and
interpret it appropriately, whether that resource is a metadata scheme, an ontology, a
recommendation from a knowledge based system, a design decision, the state of an application,
or the state of current knowledge in a field.
Examples:
—  “Rollback” in scientific analysis. This refers to services that could help answer the
question, “what did we know then?” Semantic web applications to support ‘e-science’
should provide researchers with advanced tools to analyse the history behind and
context surrounding research results.
—  Giving explanations. A well-established field in artificial intelligence, the knowledge
in this community about explanation generation needs to be brought to bear in semantic
web applications.
— Debugging semantic web applications. Developers of semantic web applications need
much more sophisticated environments to support their work (see below). A specific
aspect of this—well proven in research into conventional code development tools—is
the provision of historical traces of program execution in order to understand the state
of the code at different points in the application’s state.
—  Design rationale. Also known as design history, this is another established research
field, concerned with the effective capture of reasoning behind design decisions, to
41
support subsequent analysis and maintenance. What kinds of design rationale are of
particular importance to semantic web applications? What support can be given to its
capture and recovery by different communities?
Controlling information overload
One of the most pressing problems today is information overload. If semantic web technologies
can make a substantial contribution to tackling this problem it would represent an example of
the “killer app” that many would appreciate.
Examples:
—  Personalisation agents/profiles. This is a generic issue, independent of specific
application. There is a large and growing research literature on agent user interfaces that
needs to be brought to bear on semantic web agents. Issues that need to be better
understood include interaction techniques for defining agents (e.g. programming by
example), debugging agents (conveying programs to novice programmers), and
representing both declarative knowledge (well understood) and procedural knowledge
(poorly understood).
—  Email management. Electronic mail is arguably the ubiquitous technology that
everyone online has. For some, it has evolved from merely a communication tool to
personalised information and diary management environment. How would a
semantically enriched email environment assist in managing thousands of messages,
and related activities?
—  Collaborative filtering. How can colleagues and communities usefully share agents
and other filtering devices, without this resulting in confusing agent behaviours, or
aggravating the information overload problem?
“Lightweight” semantic collaboration
Analogous to early computers, semantic web applications tend to be “heavyweight” at present,
as we struggle to understand their properties and get real examples to work. They take a lot of
work to get running. Analogous to computing’s evolution to portable, ubiquitous devices with
good user interfaces, semantic web applications may eventually become more “lightweight”
(from the end-user’s perspective), lowering the adoption threshold.
Example:
“Good-enough” semantic interoperability. Groups who need to come together to collaborate
for a short period may want the benefits of semantic web applications but have limited
resources that they are willing to invest in achieving interoperability with each other’s
tools/resources. The challenge is to devise infrastructures that can achieve ‘good enough’
interoperability to give value. This is likely to implicate underlying representational schemes
(e.g. upper ontologies) plus quality user interfaces that communicate effectively the nature of
the interoperability.
Recommendations for future research
The following areas, which have been detailed, are worth investigating in depth:
— Sustaining use of technologies in authentic work contexts,
— Developing growth models for the semantic web,
— Designing next generation application development environments,
—  “Incidental” knowledge capture (i.e. automatic metadata generation and knowledge
base population),
42
— Understanding the use of metadata,
— Coping with “messy metadata” (from people and machines),
— Supporting collaborative, emergent consensus and “lightweight” semantic collaboration
— Maintaining and analyzing history,
— Controlling information overload.
43
Relations with other initiatives
The semantic web is a transversal topic. It does not rely on only one domain like computer
networks or artificial intelligence. Rather, it calls for the skills developed within many different
fields that can contribute to the advance of the semantic web idea. Even if a relatively
important community has already adhered to the semantic web challenge, the future semantic
web programs must be addressed to all the fields that can contribute the semantic web.
Scientific communities
The workshop participant identified many such fields listed below:
—  Artificial intelligence: reasoning mechanisms, knowledge representation languages,
approximate and rough computing, learning and resource discovery, etc.
— Databases: storage, fault tolerance, security, transactions, query languages, etc.
— Web: profiling, identification, XML-based languages and technologies, etc.
—  Agents: distributed computing, communication languages, interaction and cooperation
protocols, etc.
—  Theoretical computer science and (computational) logic: languages, theorem proving,
semantics, etc.
— System: reliability, mobility, security (web security), etc.
— Computational linguistics and pattern recognition: knowledge acquisition from primary
sources, using lexical resources for ontology development, pragmatics, question and
answering, etc.
— Document engineering and digital libraries: transformation, mark-up, indexing, etc.
—  Human-computer interface: computer-supported collaborative work, work factor
evaluation, communication studies, etc.
— Social and human sciences: ontology validation experiments, social informatics, etc.
Institutional initiatives
Many funding and institutional bodies have already launched initiatives related to the semantic
web:
— US DARPA “Agent Mark-up Language” (DAML) program for building languages and
tools for facilitating the concept of the semantic web.
—  EU IST “OntoWeb” network linking research and industrial teams involved in the
semantic web development.
— W3C “Semantic web” activity to serve in the design of specifications and the open and
collaborative development of technology.
—  Semantic Web Agreement Group (SWAG), an independent development effort for
building the semantic web infrastructure.
—  EU IST key action line on “Multimedia content and tools” and its “Semantic web
technology” program (2001) and “Knowledge technologies” program (2002).
— Japanese Interoperability Technology Association for Information Processing (INTAP)
“Semantic web” task force for proposing semantic web activities to the corporate and
institutional bodies.
—  French CNRS “specific action” on the “semantic web” for proposing future research
lines.
44
Other initiatives
Beside these purely scientific categories there are related initiative targeting application sectors
or related technologies:
—  NSF “digital library” initiative and UE-ERCIM DELOS network of excellence in
“digital libraries”. The PITAC report on “digital libraries: universal access to human
knowledge” lists as its first recommendation “support expanded digital library research
in metadata and metadata use, scalability, interoperability, archival storage and
preservation, intellectual property rights, privacy and security and human use.
—  EU IST C-Web project on “community webs” which produces a platform for
supporting communities on the web (with formal ontologies and RDF annotations).
—  MIT Oxygen and EU Ozone projects on ambient intelligence and ubiquitous
computing.
— EU IST key action line on “new methods of work and electronic commerce” including
“organisational knowledge management” and “electronic government”.
— Industrial initiatives in the domain of e-commerce, such as UN and OASIS ebXML, or
web services, such as UDDI.
—  UK research council “e-Science” programme, EU IST “grid technology and their
applications” cross-programme theme and GEANT project.
—  The EU IST Advisory Group (ISTAG) has proposed integration projects as new
instruments for the 6th framework program. Among the possible integrated projects are
“dependability, trust, security and privacy” and “community memory/sharing of
knowledge”.
45
Summary of the recommendations
The workshop recommendations have been grouped here with regard to four lines of research
that look very important and that involve several working groups at once.
Identification and localisation
Identification is an important topic for semantic web reasoning, annotating and computing. It
amounts to agreeing on how some resources can be identified, how two identifiers can be
compared or equated and how web resources can be localised for processing. This involves
works in language, infrastructure and ontological areas:
— Investigating the notion of identity in relation with the semantics of languages,
— Localising, accessing and matching resources,
— Explicit assumptions about identity in ontologies.
Relationships between semantic models
Heterogeneity must be considered as an intrinsic feature of the semantic web: no language will
be suitable for all purposes, no model will be applicable to all cases and no ontology will cover
the infinity of potential applications. Because, semantic description of information and
knowledge is available, heterogeneity can be dealt with. This involves:
— Organising in a coherent manner the multiplicity of languages of different expressivity
and purpose,
—  Reconciling the various modelling styles existing (including those from software
engineering),
— Investigating the engineering of articulation theories,
— Developing safe transformation methods,
—  Developing and articulating the different possible reasoning services (e.g., querying,
updating, deducing, inducing),
—  Experimenting transformation infrastructure (proof-carrying transformations,
processing and composing),
—  Supporting reuse and evolution: comparison, merging, versions, and conceptual
refinement of ontologies and metadata,
— Designing theories and metrics for comparing ontologies.
Tolerant and safe reasoning
A variety of reasoning methods will be necessary for different applications (from fetching to
theorem proving) and the quality of their required results will vary (from anything-will-do to
100% certified). Tolerant and safe reasoning methods adapted to the web must be developed
and the accuracy of their result must be characterised. This involves:
— Coping with “messy metadata” (from people and machines) and the open character of
the web,
— Developing tolerant inference and levels of tolerance,
— Checking proofs and policies: representation of policies, proofs and properties,
—  Propagating trust, proofs and rewards: trust model and knowledge level right
management.
46
Facilitating semantic web adoption
Semantic web adoption is a critical point. It will first depend on the availability of resources
and then on the ease of use of the semantic web. This can be achieved by:
— Acquiring ontologies and metadata from primary sources (texts, multimedia, images),
— Developing foundational ontologies and well-crafted ontology libraries,
—  Sustaining use of technologies in authentic work contexts and developing growth
models for the semantic web,
— Designing next generation application development environments,
—  “Incidental” knowledge capture (i.e. automatic metadata generation and knowledge
base population),
— Understanding the use of metadata and controlling information overload,
—  Supporting collaborative, emergent consensus and imagining “lightweight” semantic
collaboration,
— Maintaining and analyzing history.
General recommendations
—  For research, support worldwide collaboration between researchers. Obviously
because it allows to reach consensus at the global level required for the web (and not at
the continental one, see the GSM/CDMA incompatibilities). There is also a need for
non-project focussed funding. In computer science, the research is too often directed
towards prototype building though some funding for producing reports, surveys and
studies is necessary.
— For tools, encourage open source development of high quality components and non-
profit shelter organisations for software development (like Apache). For the web
CERN and NSCA have played this role at the beginning. It is possible that this model
could be applied to ontologies as well.
—  For applications, support efforts for building seeding applications of the semantic
web. Several scenarii have been provided in the present report. It is important that these
applications are not developed in isolation. We first need a set of existing applications
for improving on them.
—  For education, provide educational support (e.g. teaching material, company
“educating”, starter kits).

Conference and workshops
There had been a few workshops on the semantic web so far:
— First international workshop on the semantic web (SemWeb) in conjunction with ECDL
2000, Lisboa, PT, September 2000 (http://www.ics.forth.gr/proj/isst/SemWeb). The

Abstract 
I will present why Topic Maps are likely to play an increasing role within the context of the
Semantic Web.
Directions : enhance the quality of services for web users, including high-value corporate
assets. Make any unit semantically addressable without imposing a unique world-view.
Problems : making various communities agree on a common background platform is not easy.
This requires
defining the proper level of abstraction for ensuring efficient interchange. Separating content
from processing made on the content is not easy to explain, and is somewhat different from the
main directions taken by web services including the Semantic web.
Challenges : establish a link between various research projects done within the academic world
and the interests of business users.
Opportunities : The « semantic real estate » (similar in a way to the domain name space) is
wide open and those who will the first to occupy and exploit it will make a difference.

PARIS VI and his Ph.D. from the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers (CNAM) of
Paris, France. From 1992 until 1996, he did his research work at the French National Institute
for Research in Computer Science and Control (INRIA) in the topics of Object Database and
Documents Management Systems. Since 1997 he is adjunct professor at the Computer Science
Department of Crete University, Heraklion, Greece. His interests include, Data and Knowledge
Base Systems, Formal Models and Query Languages for semi-structured data, Wide-area
Distributed Systems, Query Optimization, Data and Process Mediation. He co-chaired the 1st
International Workshop on the Semantic Web in Lisbon and served on the commitees of
subsequent workshops on the Semantic Web.
Key words: Models and Query Languages, Metadata Management, Wide-area Distributed

Abstract
The primary goal of the Semantic Web activity so far has been the definition of  infrastructure, standards and
policies facilitating an explicit description of meaning of Web resources that can be processed by both humans
and automated tools. Complementary to the demand for universal access to information is the ever increasing need
for semantics-based access to services. These efforts towards the next evolution step of the Web have given rise to
a large number of research problems that relate to models, architectures, applications and services for the
Semantic Web. Research activity has been flourishing around these problems, with numerous impressive results,
but still leaving us with an even greater number of challenges and opportunities. Classical data management
practices are branching out of traditional frameworks, facing an unseen before demand for open-ness,
expressiveness, flexibility and scalability.
Database technology is one of the main driving forces and - in our view - the core enabling technology for
building infrastructure and services on the Semantic Web. Specifically, we regard the following problems as
cornerstone issues for the realization of the Semantic Web:
• Infrastructure for Data and Process Mediation : to facilitate automated description, discovery, brokering and
composition of e-services
• Metadata Management : to enable management and maintenance of superimposed resource descriptions and
schemas of heterogeneous data sources
•  Ontology Evolution and Metadata Revision : to support the dynamics of schemas and vocabularies
(expansion, revision)
• Transactional Aspects  for e-services : revision of ACID properties of transactions
• Formal Foundations for Web Metadata Standards : efficiently implementable formal models (expressiveness
vs. efficiency tradeoff)
•  Semantics-aware Query Languages versus Inference Services : to enable sophisticated searching and
browsing, declarative content-based access, resource discovery and matchmaking
• Persistent Storage : to enable the efficient management of voluminous resource description bases and support
effective sophisticated querying  (schema-specific storage, index structures)

Short CV
Stefan Decker did his Ph.D. studies in Computer Science at the University of Karlsruhe,
Germany where he worked on ontology based access to distributed information on the Web.
He is a postdoctoral fellow at the department of computer science at Stanford University,
where he leads (with Prof. Gio Wiederhold) the OntoAgents project in the DARPA DAML
program. He works on Semantic Web and mediation technology. His research interests include
knowledge representation and database systems for the World Wide Web, information
integration and ontology articulation and merging.
Abstract
On the Semantic Web a plethora of information models like RDF,UML, ER, OIL,
DAML+OIL, RDF Schema, XML Schema etc. are used for the exchange of structured
information, varying greatly in their expressive power. The advent of XML leveraged a
promising consensus on the encoding syntax for machine-processable information. However,
interoperating between different information models on a syntactic level proved to be a
laborious task. We suggest a layered approach to interoperability of information models that
borrows from layered software structuring techniques used in today's internetworking. We
identify the object layer that fills the gap between the syntax and semantic layers and examine
it in detail. We suggest the key features of the object layer like identity and binary
relationships, basic typing, reification, ordering, and n-ary relationships. Finally, we examine
design issues and implementation alternatives involved in building the object layer.

Short CV
Jérôme Euzenat is researcher at INRIA Rhône-Alpes (Montbonnot, France). He has worked as
a software engineer and consultant for several companies and lectured on knowledge
representation at several universities (Joseph Fourier, INPG). He holds a PhD (1990) and
habilitation (1999) in computer science, both from Grenoble 1 university. Jérôme Euzenat has
worked and published about reason maintenance systems, object-based knowledge
representation, temporal granularity and knowledge base co-operative editing. His all time
interests are tied to the relations holding between concurrent representations of the same
situation.
Jérôme Euzenat currently leads the EXMO action investigating the exchange of formal
knowledge mediated by computers. This covers formally annotated documents, knowledge
servers, content-based cooperative work and transformation of representations. It is more
focussed on the preservation of specified properties (e.g., meaning, order, or confidentiality)
the transformation of representations. This aims at contributing to a more accurate and faithful
communication of formal representations, a central topic of the  semantic web.
Key words: Transformation, semantic interoperability, customisable knowledge
representation, knowledge communication.
Abstract: Interoperability in an open semantic web
The semantic web is an infrastructure based on a network of connected formalised knowledge
repositories. Because of different expressivity and efficiency requirements, the variety of
languages for expressing knowledge seems unavoidable. In order to keep knowledge from the
web interoperable, it is necessary to have a semantically sound way to exchange and transform
knowledge. There are many solutions to this problem (including standardising to one pivot
language).
I think that, in the same way XML is an extensible meta-language, knowledge representation
languages for the web must be extensible and cannot have beforehand a fixed semantics. Each
application should be able to choose its representation language and to expose its syntax,
semantics and other rules of use (e.g., GUI display conventions). If this extensibility is taken
into account from the beginning of the semantic web, it will be possible to build an integrated
semantic web with various levels of languages.
We can put forth several possible way of dealing with this problem like family of languages
acting as a pivot language, knowledge patterns or proof carrying transformations. All these
techniques are based on the idea that it is possible to specify (syntactic) transformations from
one representation language to another and that it is possible to prove the properties that the
transformations satisfy. If a transformation is written in an intelligible language, the publication
of the proofs enables proof checking to be performed, before using the transformation with
complete trust. Of course, the satisfaction of semantic properties (like consequence
preservation) requires the exposition of the language semantics.
58
This perspective requires work at the theoretical level (about proof of particular properties,
assisted proof generation from transformation or composition of properties) and infrastructure
level (language-oriented transformation lookup, proof representation languages or fast proof
checkers).

Key words: Semantic Web, Electronic Commerce
Abstract
Electronic marketplaces for B2B electronic commerce bring together lots of suppliers and
buyers, and mediate their business transactions. This requires the marketplaces to be able to
integrate a large number of documents, specified according to certain document standards used
by marketplace participants. Existing solutions for document integration require creation and
maintenance of numerous complicated transformation rules, which hampers their scalability
required by the B2B area. Semantic web technology can provide two important solutions for
this area. Scalable mapping support for realizing the full potential of electronic commerce
based on a P2P approach and formal product and service descriptions that significantly
increase the degree of mechanization in electronic commerce. Intelligent electronic commerce
may become the killer application for semantic web technology

Abstract: Bioinformatics: a community case study for the Semantic Web
The Web was incubated by a scientific community: Physics. The Semantic Web could benefit
from being pioneered in the same way, and another scientific community, Biology, seems a
promising choice. The biology community is globally distributed and highly fragmented. Most
biological knowledge resides in a large number of modestly sized heterogeneous and
distributed resources, including: published biological literature (increasingly in electronic
form), specialised databases curated by a small number of experts, and embedded within, or
generated by, specialist analytical tools. The complex questions and analyses posed by
biologists cross the artificial boundaries set by these resources. The pressing need is
interoperation and fusion; however, current data resources have been designed to be
meaningful to, and navigated by, people rather than automated processes (a.k.a. agents). To
provide automated support for intelligent brokering, searching and filtering, and ultimately the
discovery of new knowledge, means adding computationally accessible descriptions of
meaning to the data, tools and repositories. This sounds reassuringly familiar to those versed in
the Semantic Web rhetoric. Thus the issues to be addressed by the bioinformatics community
are a version of issues to be addressed by the whole web community. The scientific community
has major concerns regarding digital signatures (for intellectual property), provenance, change
propagation, trust. The shift to “in silico” experimentation requires finding and weaving
services. The community is embracing web services coupled with workflow to do this. Much
of the biological data is self-described marked up text (pre-dating XML), and hence ontologies
for disambiguating database entries and annotation is accepted as standard practice. The
biologists have a well-established mark-up culture where resources are annotated (often by
hand) by curators, and are well aware of the need for automated metadata extraction. A recent
61
editorial in the Journal of Bioinformatics suggests that the paradigm shift in biology from
publishing papers to publishing data be extended to publishing knowledge.
I hope to explore Biology's potential as a receptive and well-organised community with clearly
articulated information and knowledge needs that can pioneer the Semantic Web. The GRID,
proposed as the next generation Internet, is another movement prevalent in e-Science. Its
Knowledge Layer seems to be closely related to the Web Services world, and I will draw
attention to this relationship.

Abstract:
I believe that, in the knowledge society, mutual understanding is more important that mass
interoperability. The current notion of the Semantic Web is a bit too much to computer-
computer knowledge integration, with little importance given to human understanding. On the
other hand, knowledge trustability seems to be a crucial problem nowadays, and cognitive
transparency is in my opinion the key to trustability. My main point is that ontologies should
aim at cognitive transparency in order to be effectively used for the semantic web. This can be
achieved by investing adequate resources in (i) principled ontology development
methodologies, aiming at a unified conceptual analysis methodology common to database
systems, object oriented systems, and knowledge-based systems ; (ii) libraries of upper level
foundational ontologies whose characteristics and implications are already well understood
(although not necessarily agreed upon) by a large community; (iii) specific ontologies
developed for strategic domains, such as: the ontology of information and information
processing, the ontology of social entities (people, organizations, laws), the ontology of social
interactions (among human and artificial agents and organizations)

and is the program chair of the 2002 International Semantic Web Conference.  His current
research interests include knowledge representation, automated reasoning, optimising
reasoning systems and ontological engineering, with particular emphasis on the application of
these techniques to the World Wide Web. He is a member of the OIL language steering
committee, the Joint EU/US Committee on Agent Markup Languages, the W3C Web Ontology
Language working group, and is an editor of the DAML+OIL language specification.
Abstract: The Semantic Web: (Ontology) Languages and Reasoning
Ontologies, and hence ontology languages, are widely recognised as being key components in
the development of the Semantic Web. In response to the requirement for a suitable web
enabled ontology language, groups of researchers in Europe and the USA developed the OIL
and DAML languages respectively. These effort were subsequently merged, with the
DAML+OIL ontology language being the result. This language has now been adopted by the
W3C web ontology language working group as the basis for a W3C ontology language
standard.
DAML+OIL is based on existing web standards, in particular RDF. It extends RDF by defining
a semantics for a set of RDF classes and properties that capture common idioms from object
oriented (e.g., frame based and description logic) knowledge representation, and by allowing
XML Schema datatypes to be used instead of RDF literals (which are simply strings). The
semantics can be specified in several ways, in particular via a model theory, via an
axiomatisation, or via a mapping to a description logic.
As in any description logic, the expressive power of DAML+OIL is determined by the kinds of
class (and property) constructors supported, and by the kinds of axiom (asserted facts) that are
allowed. As well as supporting a wide range of class constructors, DAML+OIL also supports
transitive properties, axioms asserting sub/super property relationships, and a wide range of
class axioms, all of which can be reduced to asserting sub/super class relationships between
arbitrarily complex class descriptions. This combination is equivalent to a very expressive
description logic: the logic SHIQ extended with nominals (extensionally defined classes) and
datatypes.
64
Consistency/subsumption reasoning in this logic is know to be decidable (it is contained in C2,
a decidable fragment of FOL), but many challenges remain for implementors of "practical"
reasoning systems, i.e., systems that perform well with the kinds of reasoning problem
generated by realistic applications. Although reasoners for SHIQ are already available, dealing
with inverse properties (the "I" in SHIQ) is known to be problematical, and it is not yet been
demonstrated that these reasoners can deal with realistic problems. Extending SHIQ with
datatypes seems to be harmless, but nominals are another matter: the resulting logic is know to
have high worst case complexity (NExpTime), it no longer has the tree model property, and
there is no known algorithm that appears suited to highly optimised, "practical"
implementations. Moreover, even for the SHIQ logic, there may still be problems dealing with
large ontologies and, in particular, with very large numbers of individuals.
Current research is beginning to address some of the above problems: new algorithms and
optimisation techniques have improved the performance of SHIQ reasoners, work is underway
on advanced optimisation techniques to deal with inverse properties, and experiments have
shown that it is possible for such systems to deal with very large ontologies (e.g., 100,000
classes) when the expressive power of the language is used parsimoniously. Work is also being
done on other inference problems, in particular those associated with query answering and
knowledge extraction (e.g, computing useful concepts from example instances).  However,
much work remains to be done if the full power of DAML+OIL is to be exploited by software
agents.

Short CV
Henry Lieberman is a Research Scientist at the MIT Media Lab, where he heads the Software
Agents Group, investigating how programs can act in the role of assistants to the user, rather
than simply as tools. Agent programs can learn from interacting with the user, and provide
proactive assistance. He recently edited the book,
Your Wish is My Command: Programming by Example (Morgan Kaufmann, 2001), which
describes how new behavior can be taught to a machine by presenting concrete examples, and
having the machine generalize a program. He has published many papers on a wide variety of
subjects, including tools for intelligent visual design, information visualization, programming
environments, debugging, agents for the Web, digital photography, computer music, and more.
Prior to joining the Media Lab in 1987, he was at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab since
1972, where he worked on Actors with Carl Hewitt, an early object-oriented parallel
computing formalism for AI. He invented the first real-time garbage collection algorithm and
introduced the notion of prototypes for object-oriented programming. He worked with
Seymour Papert and Hal Abelson and the group that developed the educational language Logo
and educational applications. He wrote the first color and bitmap Logo graphics systems, and
the first flood-fill graphics algorithm. He holds an Habilitation degree from the Université Paris
VI- Pierre et Marie Curie and was a Visiting Professor there.

The static model of the Web as a statically linked network of pages is now breaking down as
programs attempt to dynamically generate information, and as human browsing is increasingly
assisted by intelligent agent programs.  The next phase of the Web, the Semantic Web, lies in
encoding properties of and relationships between objects. However, to date, this semantics is
primarily declarative. It is expected to change only relatively slowly as Web pages are created,
destroyed, or modified, typically by explicit, relatively coarse-grained human action.  Less
concern has been given to dynamic semantics of the Web, which is equally important.
Dynamic semantics have to do with the just-in-time creation of content, actions which may be
guided by user-initiated interface operations, time, users’ personal profiles, or data on a server.
The challenge for the future is in methods for cleanly integrating the static and dynamic aspects
of the Web.
Dynamic semantics will enable the new generation of intelligent agent software that will
increasingly inhabit the Web. Though there will be fully autonomous agents, the more
interesting agents will cooperate interactively with humans, helping them to achieve their goals
more efficiently than a user could on their own. Beyond that, we envision that Web end users
and Web application developers will not be routinely writing code directly in any textual
language, but instead avail themselves of Programming by Example and other interactive agent
66
interfaces that will hide the details of the formal languages. Transition to these future interfaces
will be greatly aided by a foundation that can cleanly integrate static and dynamic semantics.

Abstract
The "semantic web" is a term which attracts a broad constituency of researchers to work
towards a broadly cohesive goal.  Whilst it is unlikely that they share the same precise vision of
what the "semantic web" will be, there is agreement that it is in part about creating a global
infrastructure where machines have access to the semantics of the data they are processing.
To accomplish this goal we need:
• a common, globally scalable naming system
• a common language for the representation of facts - the A-box
• a common language for the representation of information schemas - the T-box
•  a common protocol stack which permits independently developed systems to exchange
semantically rich information.
In particular, it is desirable to reduce the fragmentation amongst different efforts to achieve this
goal.
It is not enough to figure out how to build such an infrastucture, it is also our goal to bring that
infrastructure into being.  This requires:
• demonstration of the value of such semantically rich information exchange
•  enabling its feasibility through the development of powerful, usable, industrial strength,
freely available open source toolkits
• seeding its development with the provision of key enabling services

Short CV
Dr. Deborah McGuinness is associate director and senior research scientist of the Knowledge
Systems Laboratory at Stanford University. She has been working in knowledge representation
and reasoning environments for ontology creation and maintenance for 20 years. She has built
and deployed numerous ontology environments and ontology applications, including some that
have been in continuous use for over a decade at AT&T and Lucent. (Her AT&T web site has
more information on this topic.) She is a co-author of the current ontology evolution
environment from Stanford University and is also a co-author of one of the more widely used
description logic systems (CLASSIC) from Bell Laboratories. She is the co-editor of the web
ontology language for the DARPA Agent Markup Language program. The initial release is
available here and continuing updates are released from the Joint EU/US Agent Markup
Language Committee, of which she is also a member.  She is the project leader for the Rapid
Knowledge Formation project at Stanford's Knowledge Systems Laboratory. The project's goal
is to allow distributed teams of subject matter experts to quickly and easily generate, use, and
modify knowledge bases without the aid of knowledge representation and reasoning experts.
She is also the project leader for the knowledge systems laboratory's project on Tools for
DAML-Based Services, Document Templates, and Query Answering for the Darpa Agent
Markup Language project. That project's goal is to create technologies that will enable
software agents to dynamically identify and understand information sources, and to provide
interoperability between agents in a semantic manner. She is co-designing the DAML-O
language (announced on the daml web site) which is based on part on OIL - the ontology
inference layer. She is on the steering committee of the OIL consortium. The oil language is
available. She is also project manager for the ontology project with Cisco Systems.
Key words:  Ontologies, Semantic Web, Markup Languages, Description Logics
Abstract
Deborah’s current research directions have been aimed at emerging opportunities on the web.
The web must move from being presented for human interpretation to being presented for
agent interpretation.  This means that information and services need to provide more in the way
of telling agents when to use them and how to interact with them.  One solution to this is to
have expressively powerful markup languages and have environments for creating,
maintaining, and reasoning with the markup information.    These environments need to work
in distributed settings and work in the presence of incomplete and inconsistent information.
They also need to work in the presence of multiple vocabularies.  Deborah has focused both
her academic research and her consulting work around generating, evolving, merging, and
analyzing structured information, such as that representable in the DAML+OIL ontology
language.  Some main areas of growth in these areas will be in the collaboration, diagnostics,
truth maintenance, persistence, query languages, rule extensions and other reasoning, and
filtering and presentation.
69
Applications areas that are expected to drive this work include business to business web
interactions, supply chain applications (requiring strong interoperability and some
configuration requirements), configuration in general,and  agent-based web services.

Abstract
The semantic web idea crucially depends on the adoption and specification of ontologies seen
as the glue to link services and resources semantically.  Even if we simply focus on these two
processes, specifying and populating ontologies, a number of important issues arise: “how do
communities agree on ontology specifications?”, “what about those domains where there is
little consensus, or where the underlying conceptual framework evolves rapidly?”, “to what
extent will it be possible to support automatic merging and linking of ontologies developed by
different communities?”, “how can we speed up the expensive resource annotation process?”,
etc.  Although these are crucial questions, they are actually situated at the “semantic
infrastructure” level: in other words, solving these problems is primarily important to enable us
to focus on the really interesting issues related to inventing and deploying novel semantic web
functionalities.  So, assuming that the semantic web takes off and semantic services and
resources become widespread, what are the interesting challenges for the community?  My own
personal interest is primarily in the seamless integration of semantic web technology in the
normal tools of work.  For instance, while I am writing this document, I would expect semantic
agents to find me relevant information.  Even  more importantly, once this document is
completed, rather than the standard “Save” button, I should be able to press a “Publish++”
button, which may automatically annotate the document with semantic information (e.g., link it
to relevant projects, research areas, application domains, technologies, etc.), may notify some
of my colleagues (but only the ones who are going to be interested in the topic of the
document!), may publish it in one or more semantically enriched repositories, which in turn
allow users to locate relevant information for different classes of users, with different access
rights, in a variety of work contexts to do with projects, research areas, application domains,
72
virtual teams, etc. Clearly, authoring is only one part of the picture. I also receive/send email,
manage my own diary, access services on the web, belong to several virtual teams scattered
around the world, etc. Can semantic web technology become ubiquitous and an enabler for
individual and/or teamwork?  This is, I believe, the greatest opportunity and the greatest
challenge.

Abstract: Semantic Web for Generalized Knowledge Management
Knowledge is one of the most crucial success factors for enterprises. Therefore, Knowledge
Management (KM) has been recognized as a very important strategy for enterprises. Clearly,
KM is an interdisciplinary task, including human resource management, enterprise
organization and culture as well as IT technology. However, there is a clear agreement, that IT
technology plays an important role as an enabler for many aspects of a KM solution.
In the past, IT technology for knowledge management has focused on the management of
knowledge containers using text documents as the main repository and source of information.
Nowadays, Semantic Web technology, especially ontologies and relational metadata, pave the
way to KM solutions that are based on semantically related knowledge pieces of different
granularity: Ontologies define a shared conceptualization of the application domain at hand and
provide the basis for defining metadata that have a precisely define semantics and are therefore
machine-processable. Although first KM approaches and solutions have shown the benefits of
ontologies and related methods there exists still a collection of open research issues that have
to be addressed in order to make Semantic Web technologies a complete success for KM
solutions:
75
•  Industrial KM applications have to avoid any kind of overhead as far as possible.
Therefore, a seamless integration of knowledge creation, e.g. metadata creation, and
knowledge access, e.g. querying or browsing, into the working environment is required.
Strategies and methods are needed that support the creation of knowledge as side-effects of
activities that are carried out anyway.
•  Access to as well as presentation of knowledge has to be context-dependent and
personalized. Only then, information overload can be avoided, a prerequisite for keeping a
KM application alive.
•  In  real life applications the manual engineering of ontologies is a crucial bottleneck.
Furthermore, KM applications have to reflect their changing business environment, and so
do ontologies. Cooperative ontology engineering environments that integrate tools for the
manual construction of ontologies with machine learning and information extraction
methods for generating parts of ontologies seem to be a promising approach. Yet, ontology
learning is still a basic research topic.
• In the same way, the manual specification of metadata is not feasible in practice. Therefore,
information extraction capabilities based on (simple) linguistic methods have to be
combined with ontologies in order to semi-automatically generate the required metadata.
•  Semantically defined metadata are not only required for text sources, but also for
multimedia sources. Therefore, metadata standards for multimedia sources that are up to
now more syntactically oriented, have to be combined with metadata standards that are
available for text sources.
• Currently, ontology-based KM solutions are typically based on single ontologies. However,
most real life scenarios will require the usage of multiple ontologies. Therefore, methods
and tools are required for reusing ontologies that are stored in repositories somewhere on
the web and for aligning them on the fly according to the given application scenario at
hand. Reuse and dynamic semantic alignment of ontologies are both open research
topics.
•  Peer-to-Peer computing combined with Semantic Web technology will be an interesting
path to get rid of the more centralized environments that are currently implied by ontology-
based solutions. P2P scenarios open up the way to derive consensual conceptualizations in
a bottom-up manner. However, the development of the methods and tools that are needed
for achieving such emergent semantics in P2P environments is in the very beginning.
• KM solutions will in the near future be more and more based on a combination of intranet-
based functionalities and mobile functionalities. Semantic Web technologies are a
promising approach to meet the needs of the mobile environments, like e.g. location-
aware personalization and adaptation to presentation needs of mobile devices, i.e. the
presentation of the required information on an appropriate level of granularity.
• The development of knowledge portals serving the needs of companies or communities is
still a more or less manual process. Ontologies and related metadata provide a promising
conceptual basis for generating parts of such knowledge portals. Obviously, conceptual
models of the domain, the users and the tasks are needed among others.
•  Virtual organizations become more and more important in business scenarios that are
characterized by decentralization and globalization. Obviously, semantic interoperability as
well as trust is a must in inter-organizational business processes. Semantic Web technology
provides a promising starting point for addressing these challenges.
•  The integration of KM applications, e.g. skill management, with eLearning is an
important field enabling a lot of synergy between these to areas. KM solutions and
76
eLearning have to be integrated from both an organizational and an IT point of view.
Clearly, interoperabiltiy and/or integration of (metadata) standards are needed to realize
such an integration.

Abstract:
“We’re at the stage of figuring out how to mix tarmac that will hold together… it’s going to be
a while before we have good models for urban planning and traffic flow…”   The Semantic
Web seems to mean many things to many people. My own vision, drawing inspiration from
Doug Engelbart’s work, is of a global information infrastructure that people trust, and that
augments intellectual work. Machine interoperability will doubtless assist this, but while we
figure out how to ‘get the tarmac to hold together’, understandably, rather less is being said
about how the people (for whom these services are being developed) will fit into and mould
this infrastructure to their own ends. Like many others, I am developing technologies for
people to create and manipulate conceptual structures, and envisage Semantic Web
technologies as part of this. If so, Semantic Web research must begin to wrestle with a
multitude of hard questions concerning the design of useful, usable, trusted formalisms and
modelling techniques – questions that research communities have been wrestling with for years
in hypertext, computer-supported collaborative work, human-computer interaction and
knowledge-based systems. I will highlight questions that a human-centric perspective on
formalisms and work practice raise.
•  “Unnatural acts”: the SemWeb will require vast amounts of knowledge acquisition and
careful codification. Who will (be paid?) to do this? We know that normal people dislike
creating metadata – that’s why we have librarians. And we know that machines can extract
metadata and populate ontologies at best in semi-automated manner.
78
•  Distributed group working: metadata changes its meaning over time and across groups.
How to manage this?
•  Ontologies are all about classification. We know that taxonomies are embedded in
perspectives, and often the subject of wars and compromises to establish a ‘standard’. How
to represent the contextual factors that will support coherent maintenance and updating?
• How do we design SemWeb applications in a way that fully involves domain experts and
end-users, when for instance, they don’t understand the technicalities of ontologies, nor
how they may support inference?
• SemWeb applications model people and work more explicitly than previous technologies.
How to make them trustworthy, and prevent them from getting out of sync in a fast
changing world?

Abstract:
A strength of the current proposals for the foundational languages of the Semantic Web (RDF
Schema, DAML+OIL), it that they are all based on formal logic. However, this reliance on
logics is not only a strength but also a weakness. Traditionally, logic has always aimed at
modelling idealised forms of reasoning under idealised circumstances. Clearly, this is not what
is required under the practical circumstances of the Semantic Web. Instead, the following are
all needed:
• reasoning under time-pressure;
• reasoning with other limited resources besides time;
•  reasoning that is not ``perfect'' but instead ``good enough'' for given tasks under given
circumstances;
• reasoning-algorithms that do not behave as yes/no oracles, but that instead display anytime
behaviour;
• etc.
It is tempting to conclude that symbolic, formal logic fails on all these counts, and to abandon
that paradigm.  However, research in the past few years, to which members of my group and
myself have contributed, has developed methods with the above properties while staying
within the framework of symbolic, formal logic. These methods carry names such as
approximate reasoning, anytime inference, knowledge compilation, etc.
