Abstract
As the size and diversity of the World Wide Web grows rapidly, it is becoming more and
more difficult for a user to skim over a Web site and get an idea of its contents. Currently,
manually constructed summaries by volunteer experts are available, such as the DMOZ Open
Directory Project. This research is directed towards automating the Web site summarization
task. To achieve this objective, an approach which applies machine learning and natural
language processing techniques is developed to summarize a Web site automatically. The
information content of the automatically generated summaries is compared, via a formal
evaluation process involving human subjects, to DMOZ summaries, home page browsing and
time-limited site browsing, for a number of academic and commercial Web sites. Statistical
evaluation of the scores of the answers to a list of questions about the sites demonstrates
that the automatically generated summaries convey the same information to the reader as
DMOZ summaries do, and more information than the two browsing options.

1 Introduction
As the size and diversity of the World Wide Web grows rapidly, vast amounts of online infor-
mation continues to grow at an incredible rate, leading to “information overload” [21]. It has
been more and more difficult for the user to skim over a Web site and get an idea of its con-
tents. Currently, manually constructed summaries by volunteer experts are available, such
as the DMOZ Open Directory Project [1]. These human-authored summaries give a concise
and effective description of popular Web sites. However, they are subjective, and expensive
to build and maintain [8]. Our objective is to summarize the Web site automatically.
The information overload problem has brought users great difficulty to find useful in-
formation quickly and effectively. The technology of automatic summarization of text is
maturing and may provide a solution to this problem [21, 19]. Automatic text summa-
rization produces a concise summary by abstraction or extraction of important text using
statistical approaches [9], linguistic approaches [4] or combination of the two [5, 14, 19].
The goal of abstraction is to produce coherent summaries that are as good as human
authored summaries. However, this is very difficult to achieve with current natural language
processing techniques [14]. During the last few years, extraction techniques have been the
focus of automatic text summarization research [17]. Extraction systems analyze a source
document to determine significant sentences, and produce a concise summary from these
significant sentences. The significance of a sentence is determined by a few features such as
the density of keywords and rhetorical relations in the context [26].
With the continuing explosion of online data, demand for multi-document summarization
techniques is growing. Multi-document summaries with high quality can save users much
2
time in reading relevant text documents or browsing interesting Web sites. Many of the
single-document summarization techniques can also be used in multi-document summariza-
tion. Moreover, features such as information about the whole document set and relationships
between individual documents can also be analyzed and incorporated in the multi-document
summarization [15, 19].
There are two major approaches to summarization evaluation: intrinsic and extrinsic [16,
21]. Intrinsic evaluation compares automatically generated summaries with a gold standard
(ideal summaries). Extrinsic evaluation measures the performance of automatically created
summaries in a particular task (e.g., classification). The extrinsic evaluation is also called
task-based evaluation and it has become more and more popular recently [23]. In recent
years, the importance o evaluation of summarization algorithms has increased (e.g. [20, 13]),
due to the desire for better summaries [19].
Research interest in Web page summarization has been increasing over the last several
years. Basically Web page summarization derives from text summarization techniques [9].
However, it is a great challenge to summarize Web pages automatically and effectively [3],
because Web pages differ from traditional text documents in both structure and content.
Instead of coherent text with a well-defined discourse structure, Web pages often have diverse
contents such as bullets and images [6].
Currently there is no effective way to produce unbiased, coherent and informative sum-
maries of Web pages automatically. Amitay et al [3] propose a unique approach, which
relies on the hypertext structure and the way information is described under it. Instead of
analyzing the document, this approach exploits Web authoring conventions, understanding
how useful information can be extracted from hypertext layout and language structure. This
3
approach is applied to “generate short coherent textual snippets presented to the user with
search engine results” [3].
Garcia-Molina et al [9] compare alternative methods to summarize Web pages for display
on handheld devices. The Keyword method extracts keywords from the text units, and the
Summary method identifies the most significant sentence of each text unit as a summary
for the unit. They test the performance of these methods by asking human subjects to per-
form specific tasks using each method, and conclude that the combined Keyword/Summary
method provides the best performance in terms of access times and number of pen actions
on the hand held devices.
Our objective is to automate summarization of Web sites, not simply Web pages. To
this end, the “Keyword/Summary” idea of [9] is adopted. However, this methodology is
enhanced by applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques. A
summary is produced in a sequence of stages as indicated in Figure 1. First a given number
of web pages is collected from a given web site via a breadth-first search starting at the
home page. Second, plain text is extracted from these pages and partitioned into text
paragraphs by the text browser Lynx (Section 2). In the third step, short paragraphs are
first filtered out of all paragraphs, then long paragraphs are classified into narrative or
non-narrative. Criteria for these two operations were achieved by training data sets using
both machine learning approaches and natural language processing techniques (Section 3).
Fourth, decision tree rules are used to extract key-phrases from narrative text, anchor text
and special text (e.g., italic text), separately. These rules were achieved by applying machine
learning approaches to measure how significant each category of key-phrases is (Section 4).
After key-phrases are extracted, narrative paragraphs will be reviewed in order to find the

most significant sentences, as the ones containing a high density of key-phrases. Finally, the
summary is generated, which consists of the top 25 key-words, top 10 key-terms and top 5
key-sentences (Section 5). The automatically generated summaries are compared with the
DMOZ summaries of the same site, home page browsing and time-limited site browsing, for
a number of academic and commercial Web sites (Section 6).
2 Web Page and Text Extraction
In general, the structure of a Web site is hierarchical. In a breadth-first traversal of a Web
site, the home page is the root, i.e., first level. All Web pages pointed at from the home
page are in the second level, and so on. Intuitively, contents of pages near the top are more
representative of the general content of the site than pages deeper into the site. The home
page of a Web site often presents a brief description of what this site is about. When we go
deeper into the Web site, Web pages tend to discuss specific topics in detail.
Since our objective is to summarize the Web site, we want to focus on top-level pages in
order to extract the contents which describe the Web site in a general sense. A module called
5
Site Crawler was developed, that crawls within a given web site using breadth-first-search.
This means that only Web pages physically located in this site will be crawled and analyzed.
Besides tracking the URLs of these Web pages, the Site Crawler also records the depth (i.e.
level) and length of each page. Depth represents the number of “hops” from the home page
to the current page. For example, if we give the home page depth 1, then all pages which
can be reached by an out-link of the home page are assigned depth 2. Length of a Web page
is the number of characters in the Web page source file. The Site Crawler only keeps known
types of Web pages, such as .htm, .html, .shtml, .php, etc. Handling other types of text and
non-text files is a topic for future research.
Normally the Site Crawler crawls the top 1000 pages of a Web site, according to a
breadth-first traversal starting from the home page. The number of pages to crawl (1000) is
based on the observation after crawling 60 Web sites (identified in DMOZ subdirectories),
that there is an average of 1000 pages up to and including depth equal to 4. For each Web
site, the Site Crawler will stop crawling when either 1000 pages have been collected, or it
has finished crawling depth 4, whichever comes first. Table 1 gives an example of samples
of URLs, including depth and length, of the top 1000 pages from the Microsoft Corporation
Web site.
After the URLs of the top 1000 Web pages are collected, the plain text must be extracted
from these pages. Several packages are available for this purpose. Two of them, HTML2TXT
[24] by Thomas Sahlin and html2txt [22] by Gerald Oskoboiny are compared against the text
browser Lynx [10] and an HTML Parser developed by the authors. Our HTML Parser
identifies all HTML tags in a Web page, removes dynamic content such as JavaScript, and

Table 1: Example of URLs, depth & length of top 1000 pages

In order to test the individual performance of these four packages, 100 Web pages from
DMOZ subdirectories were manually collected. There were no constraints such as size or
type to these pages. Then the quality of the text parts generated by the four different
packages is evaluated by the authors on a scale: 5-Excellent, 4-Good, 3-Satisfactory, 2-Poor,
or 1-Bad. The quality is determined by considering both how much text is missing and how
much non-text is included.
As indicated in Figure 2, Lynx is the most powerful package with an average score of 4.4,
and hence in this work Lynx is used.
3 Narrative Text Extraction
The summary of the Web site will be created on the basis of the text extracted by Lynx.
However, Web pages often contain isolated phrases, bullets or very short sentences, instead
of a coherent narrative structure. Such text provides little foothold for a coherent and

meaningful summary [6], so our aim is to identify rules for determining which paragraphs
should be considered for summarization and which ones should be discarded. This is achieved
in two steps: First, criteria are defined for determining if a paragraph is long enough to be
considered for analysis. Then, additional criteria are defined to classify long paragraphs into
narrative or non-narrative. Only narrative paragraphs are used in summary generation. The
criteria are defined automatically using supervised machine learning.
3.1 Long Paragraph Classification
During our experiments with the crawler, it is observed that some paragraphs are too
short (in terms of number of words, number of characters, etc.) for summary generation,
e.g., This Web page is maintained by David Alex Lamb of Queen’s University. Contact:
dalamb@spamcop.net.
Intuitively, whether a paragraph is long or short is determined by its length (i.e., the
number of characters). However, two more features, number of words, and number of char-
acters in all words, might also play key roles. In order to determine which feature is the

most important, a total of 700 text paragraphs is extracted from 100 Web pages. Statistics
of three attributes Length, NumberOfWords and NumberOfChars are recorded from each
paragraph. Length is the number of all characters in the paragraph. NumberOfWords is the
number of words in this paragraph, and NumberOfChars is the total number of characters
in all words. Then each text paragraph is labelled as long or short manually. The decision
tree learning program C5.0 [2] is used to construct a classifier, LONGSHORT, for this task.
The training set consists of 700 instances. Each instance consists of the values of three
attributes and the associated class, as shown in Table 2. The resulting decision tree and
its evaluation via ten-fold cross-validation are shown in Fig. 3. Among the 700 cases, there
are 36 cases misclassified, leading to an error of 5.1%. The cross-validation of the classifier
is listed in Table 3. The mean error rate 5.9% indicates the classification accuracy of this
classifier.

3.2 Narrative Paragraph Classification
Not all long paragraphs provide coherent information in terms of generating a meaningful
summary. Intuitively, among the long paragraphs, narrative ones provide more coherent and
meaningful content than non-narrative ones.
An example of a narrative paragraph is: The users login file usually defines the command
aliases and author identification (for the update history). Then one normally opens one or
more CMZ files depending on the size of the project.
An example of a non-narrative paragraph: * ESTIMATE Professional (software project
planning and estimation); * EssentialSET (documentation templates, process framework); *
ISOplus (quality systems documentation)
Informally, whether a paragraph is narrative or non-narrative is determined by the coher-
ence of its text. We hypothesize that the frequencies of the part-of-speech tags of the words
in the paragraph contain sufficient information to classify a paragraph as narrative. To test
this hypothesis, a training set is generated as follows: First, 1000 Web pages are collected
from DMOZ subdirectories, containing a total of 9763 text paragraphs, among which a total
10
of 3243 paragraphs were classified as long. Then, the part-of-speech tags for all words in
these paragraphs are computed using a rule-based part-of-speech tagger [7].
The tagger accomplishes its task in two stages. First, every word is assigned its most likely
tag in isolation. Unknown words are first assumed to be nouns (proper nouns if capitalized),
and then cues based upon prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and adjacent word co-occurrence are
used to change the guess of most likely tag. Second, contextual transformations are used
to improve accuracy. For example, the tag of a word is changed from verb to noun if the
previous word is tagged as a determiner. In this work, the list of 32 tags shown in Appendix
A is used.
After part-of-speech tagging, the following attributes are extracted from each paragraph.
Let ni (i = 1, 2, ... , 32) be the number of occurrences of tag i, and S be the total number
of tags (i.e. words) in the paragraph. Let Pi be the fraction of S, that ni represents.
S =
32∑
i=1
ni
Pi = ni/S (i = 1, 2, ..., 32) (1)
A total of 34 attributes are associated with each paragraph in the training set. The
length of the paragraph in characters, and the length of the paragraph in words are added to
the 32 attributes P1, P2, ..., P32, as defined in equation 1. Then each paragraph is manually
labelled as narrative or non-narrative. Finally, a C5.0 classifier NARRATIVE is trained on
the training set of 3243 paragraphs, shown in Table 4.
The decision tree and its evaluation generated by the C5.0 program is presented in Figure
4. Among the 3242 cases, about 63.5% of them are following this rule: if the percentage of
Symbols is less than 6.8%, and the percentage of Preposition is more than 5.2%, and the per-

4 Key-Phrase Extraction
Traditionally, key-phrases (key-words and key-terms) are extracted from the document in
order to generate a summary. Based on these phrases, the most significant sentences, which
best describe the document, are retrieved.
Key-phrase extraction from a body of text relies on an evaluation of the importance of
each phrase [9]. In terms of automatically summarizing a Web site, a phrase is considered
as key-phrase, if and only if it occurs very frequently in the Web pages of the site, i.e., the
total frequency is very high. This concept is different from the traditional TF/IDF measure
[25], where a phrase within a given text is considered most important if it occurs frequently
within the text, but infrequently in the larger collection of documents [9]. The validity of our
key-phrase concept can be illustrated by a counterexample: suppose there is a page talking
about Linux, and Linux occurs very frequently in this page, but rarely in the rest of the
pages. Then Linux must be a good key-phrase based on TF/IDF. However, Linux is not
good in describing the whole site.
In this work, a key-phrase can be either key-word or key-term. Key-word is a single word
with very high frequency over the set of Web pages, and key-term is a two-word term with
very high frequency.
As we discussed in the previous section, Web pages are quite different from traditional
documents. The existence of anchor text and special text contributes much to the difference.
Anchor text is the text of hyper links, and it “often provides more accurate descriptions of
Web pages than the pages themselves” [8]. Special text includes title, headings and bold or
italicized text. The assumption is that both anchor text and special text may play a key

role in describing important topics of Web pages. Therefore a supervised learning approach
is applied to test this assumption.
4.1 Key-word Extraction
First we discuss how to produce decision tree rules for determining the key-words of a Web
site. A data set of 5454 candidate key-words (at most 100 for each site) from 60 Web sites
are collected. The sites are taken from DMOZ subdirectories. For each site, the frequency
of each word in narrative text, anchor text and special text, is measured. Then the total
frequency of each word over these three categories is computed, where the weight for each
category is the same.
As it can be seen in Table 6, f is the total frequency of a candidate key-word, fn, fa,
and fs are the frequencies of a candidate key-word in narrative text, anchor text and special
text, respectively, hence f = fn + fa + fs. For example, the word system occurs 4648, 310
and 492 times in narrative text, anchor text and special text, respectively. This yields a total
frequency of 5450. Moreover, it should be noted that 425 stop words (a, about, above, across,
after, again, against, all, almost, alone, along, already, also, although, always, among, an,
and, ...) [11] are discarded in this stage.

Figure 5: Rank-Frequency data and Zipf’s Law
After all distinct words and their frequency statistics were recorded, a simple stemming
process was applied to identify each singular noun and its plural form. Then the frequencies
of the two are added. For example, product : 2100 and products : 460 yields product : 2560.
After this process, on the average there were about 5,100 different words (excluding stop
words) within the text body of the top 1000 Web pages. The top 5 words often have a
frequency of more than 2,000, which depends on the contents of Web pages, whereas the
bottom ones may occur only twice or even once. Figure 5 shows that the rank and frequency
statistics of these words fit Zipf’s Law [18]. The bottom words are obviously not key-words,
hence only those words whose frequency is more than 5% of the maximum frequency are kept
as candidate key-words. This step eliminates about 98% of the original words, leaving about
102 candidate key-words per site. As a result, the top 100 candidate key-words are kept and
nine features of each candidate key-word Ci are created, as shown in Table 7. The feature
Tag was obtained by tagging candidate key-words with rule-based part-of-speech tagger [7].

Next, each candidate key-word is labelled manually as key-word or non-key-word. The
criterion to determine if a candidate key-word is a true key-word is that a key-word provides
important information which is related with the Web site. Based on frequency statistics
and part-of-speech feature of these candidate key-words, a C5.0 classifier KEY-WORD is
constructed as shown in Table 8.
The decision tree and its evaluation generated by the C5.0 program are presented in
Figure 6. Among the total 5454 cases, 222 cases are misclassified, leading to an error of
4.1%. In the decision tree, about 35% of cases are following this rule: if R (defined as the
ratio of a candidate key-word’s frequency to the maximum frequency in Table 7) is less than
or equal to 0.1, then this candidate key-word is a non-key-word. Another main stream of

cases follows the second rule: if R is greater than 0.1, and part-of-speech tag is NN (common
singular nouns, see Table 14), and RA (ratio in anchor text) is less than or equal to 0.798,
then the candidate key-word is a key-word. These cases cover 45% of the data set.
An interesting rule here is: if R is greater than 0.1, and part-of-speech tag is NNS
(common plural nouns, see Table 14), then the candidate key-word should be classified as
key-word. However, among these 138 cases, 50 were misclassified. This means that this
training set was not effective in identifying common plural nouns, due to an insufficient
number of such cases. The most important rule is: if R is greater than 0.1 and part-of-
speech tag is NN (common singular nouns) or V BG (verb -ing, see Table 14), then WA
(weight in anchor text), RA (ratio in anchor text) and/or WS (weight in special text) will
determine if a candidate key-word should be classified as key-word or non-key-word. This
demonstrates that our assumption is true, i.e., anchor text and special text do play important
roles in determining key-words of a Web site. The cross-validation results of the classifier
KEY-WORD is listed in Table 9. The mean error rate 4.9% indicates the predictive accuracy
of this classifier.

site. For example, at the Software Engineering Institute Web site1, the words software and
engineering have frequency 7805 and 3430, respectively, and the term software engineering
occurs 2492 times. Thus, a similar approach with automatic key-word extraction is developed
to identify key-terms of the Web site.
The algorithm combines any two of the top 100 candidate key-words and searches for
these terms in collocation over narrative text, anchor text and special text. Then these terms
are sorted by frequency and the top 30 are kept as candidate key-terms. A C5.0 classifier
KEY-TERM is constructed based on frequency statistics and tag features of 1360 candidate
key-terms, which were extracted from 60 Web sites (collected from DMOZ subdirectories).
The C5.0 classifier KEY-TERM is similar to the KEY-WORD classifier except that it has
two part-of-speech tags Tag1 and Tag2, one for each component word.
Once the decision tree rules for determining key-terms have been built, they are applied
for automatic key-term extraction to the top 1000 Web pages of a Web site. The top 10
key-terms (ranked by total frequency) for each site are kept as part of the summary. Then
the frequency of candidate key-words is reduced by subtracting the frequency of top 10
key-terms, which includes them. For example, the actual frequency of the words software
and engineering above becomes 7805 − 2492 = 5313 and 3430 − 2492 = 938, respectively.
Then candidate key-words of the Web site are classified into key-word or non-key-word by
applying the KEY-TERM classifier shown in Figure 6. Finally, the top 25 key-words (ranked
by frequency) are kept as part of the summary. It is observed that 40% to 70% of key-words
and 20% to 50% of key-terms appear in the home page of a Web site.

5 Key-Sentence Extraction
Once the key-words and key-terms are identified, the most significant sentences can be
retrieved from all narrative paragraphs. Each sentence is assigned a significance factor or
sentence weight. The top five sentences, ranked according to sentence weight, are chosen
as part of the summary. In order to achieve this goal, we applied a modified version of the
procedure in [9].
First, the sentences containing any of the list L of key-phrases, consisting of the top 25
key-words and top 10 key-terms identified previously, are selected.
Second, all clusters in each selected sentence S are identified. A cluster C is a sequence
of consecutive words in the sentence for which the following is true: (1) the sequence starts
and ends with a key-phrase in L, and (2) less than D non-key-phrases must separate any two
neighboring key-phrases within the sentence. D is called the “distance cutoff”, and we used
a value of 2 as in [9]. Table 10 gives an example of clustering, where key-words, key-terms
and clusters are listed.
Third, the weight of each cluster within S is computed. The maximum of these weights
is taken as the sentence weight. A cluster weight is computed by adding the weights of all
key-phrases within the cluster, and dividing this sum by the total number of words within
the cluster [9]. The weight of key-phrase i is defined as Wi = fi/
∑
100
i=1 fi, where fi is the
frequency of the key-phrase in the web site (Table 7). For example, the second cluster’s
weight in Table 10 is (0.021 + 0.293 + 0.013)/ 5 = 0.065.
However, division by the total number of words in the cluster decreases the weight too
much when there are several key-phrases present together with a large number of non-

Table 10: Example of clustering
key-phrases. After some informal experimentation, the best cluster weighting (in terms of
assigning the highest weight to the most informative sentences) is obtained by adding the
weights of all key-phrases within the cluster, and dividing this sum by the total number of
key-phrases within the cluster. Hence the second cluster’s weight in Table 10 will now be
(0.021 + 0.293 + 0.013)/ 3 = 0.109 and the first cluster’s weight is (0.293 + 0.021)/ 2 = 0.157,
therefore the sentence weight is 0.157.
The weights of all sentences in narrative text paragraphs are computed and the top
five sentences ranked according to sentence weights are included in the summary as key-
sentences. These key-sentences are expected to give a general idea of the contents of the
Web site. Finally, a summary is formed consisting of the top 25 key-words, top 10 key-terms
and top 5 key-sentences. Table 11 shows the generated summary of the Software Engineering
Institute (SEI) Web site. This summary gives a brief description of SEI’s mission, operator

6 Experiments and Evaluation
In order to measure the overall performance of our approach, four sets of experiments were
performed. During these experiments, automatically generated summaries are compared
with human-authored summaries, home page browsing and time-limited site browsing, to
measure their performance in a specific task. Moreover, the performance of our approach
is measured separately on academic Web sites and commercial ones, to test if there is any
significant difference between them.
6.1 W3SS and DMOZ Summaries
From the DMOZ Open Directory Project, 20 manually constructed summaries were selected
from four subdirectories. As listed in Table 12, sites 1-5 are in the Software/Software En-
gineering2 subdirectory. Sites 6-10 are in the Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments3
subdirectory. Sites 11-15 are in Major Companies/Publicly Traded4 subdirectory. And finally
sites 16-20 are in E-Commerce/Technology Vendors5 subdirectory. These sites were selected
randomly and are of varying size and focus. Sites 1-10 are academic ones, with a focus on
academic or non-profit research and/or development, whereas sites 11-20 are commercial
ones, which deliver commercial products and/or services.
Our approach, W3SS (World Wide Web Site Summarization), is used to create summaries
of these 20 Web sites. Each W3SS summary consists of the top 25 key-words, the top 10
key-terms and the top 5 key-sentences.

6.2 Summarization Evaluation
There are two major types of summarization evaluations: intrinsic and extrinsic [16, 21].
Intrinsic evaluation compares automatically generated summaries against a gold standard
(ideal summaries). Extrinsic evaluation measures the performance of automatically gener-
ated summaries in a particular task (e.g., classification). Extrinsic evaluation is also called
task-based evaluation and it has become more and more popular recently [23]. In this work,
extrinsic evaluation is used.
In extrinsic evaluation, the objective was to measure how informative W3SS summaries,
DMOZ summaries, home page browsing and time-limited site browsing are in answering a
set of questions (Appendix D) about the content of the Web site. Each question is meant
24
to have a well-defined answer, ideally explicitly stated in the summary, rather than being
open-ended. Four groups of graduate students in Computer Science (5 in each group) with
strong World Wide Web experience were asked to take the test as follows:
The first and second group was asked to read each W3SS and DMOZ summary, respec-
tively and then answer the questions. The third group was asked to browse the home page of
each of the 20 Web sites and answer the questions. The last group was asked to browse each
Web site for at most 10 minutes (time-limited site browsing) and answer all questions. All
answers were then graded in terms of their quality in a scale 0-20. The grades are tabulated
in Appendix E.
Evaluation of W3SS Summaries The average score of all summaries over five subjects
is 15.0. The average score of each W3SS summary over five subjects varies from 8.8 to
19.6, which means the quality of W3SS summaries varies from site to site. Summaries of
Nortel Networks and Microsoft Corporation Web sites get the top two average scores 19.6
and 19.2, respectively. These two summaries give a brief but accurate description of the
corporations. The summary of the Adhesion Technologies Web site gets the lowest average
score 8.8, because it describes specific software products the company delivers but no general
information about the company is available. The summary with the second lowest average
score 10.0 corresponds to a site that contains archives of Software Engineering but the
summary gives a description of specific software tools and cannot convey any sense of that
this site is an information resource. However, the variance between the average scores of all
summaries over five subjects is only 0.213, which shows that all subjects in this experiment
evaluated W3SS summaries consistently.

Evaluation of DMOZ Summaries The average score of all summaries over all subjects
is 15.3, hence the overall performance of DMOZ summaries is slightly better than that of
W3SS ones (with an overall average 15.0). The average score of each DMOZ summary over
five subjects varies from 11.0 to 19.2. However, the variance between the average scores of
all DMOZ summaries over five subjects is 1.267, much larger than that of W3SS summaries.
As indicated in Figure 7, there are 11 Web sites whose W3SS summaries are better than
DMOZ summaries, and 8 sites whose W3SS summaries are worse than DMOZ summaries.
The remaining site has the same quality of W3SS and DMOZ summary.
Evaluation of home page browsing Since every subject was allowed to browse only the
home page, there are a few very poor marks as low as 4.4 and 5.0. The average score of all
home pages over five subjects is 12.7, which is less than 15.0 of W3SS summaries and 15.3
of DMOZ summaries.

W3SS Summary Home Page Browsing
Figure 8: W3SS summaries vs. Home page browsing
As indicated in Figure 8, the performance of W3SS summaries is better than or the same
as that of home page browsing. This experiment tells us that the home page alone is often
not sufficiently informative, and that digging deeper into the site conveys more complete
information about the site than the home page alone. In order to understand the site better,
more browsing beyond the home page alone is needed.
Evaluation of time-limited site browsing In this test, every subject was allowed 10
minutes to browse each Web site, and look for the answers of all questions. For each site,
the average score of all subjects varies from 7.0 to 20.0. This implies that either some Web
sites were poorly designed, or there is too much non-text (e.g., flash)in top-level pages, which
may confuse the user’s understanding of the site. The average score of each site browsing
over all subjects is 13.4, which is less than that of both W3SS and DMOZ summaries.
As indicated in Figure 9, the performance of W3SS summaries is generally better than

W3SS Summary Time-limited Site Browsing
Figure 9: W3SS summaries vs. Time-limited site browsing
that of time-limited site browsing. This means it is not so easy to get a good understanding
of the site’s main contents by browsing within a limited time period. If the W3SS summary
of a Web site is available, then the reader can know the site’s main contents by viewing the
summary without spending much time in browsing the site. This indicates that our approach
of automatically creating summaries is potentially useful because it saves the reader much
time.
To confirm the above intuitive conclusions, we perform a two-factor Analysis of Variance
with replications on the raw scores from the above experiments. As shown in Table 13, there
is no significant difference between our summaries and the human-authored summaries, and
between home-page and time-limited site browsing. However, our summaries and the human-
authored summaries are significantly better than home-page and time-limited site browsing.

7 Conclusion and Discussion
In this work, we developed a new approach for generating summaries of web sites. Our ap-
proach applies machine learning and natural language processing techniques to extract and
classify narrative paragraphs from the web site, from which key-phrases are then extracted.
Key-phrases are in turn used to extract key-sentences from the narrative paragraphs that
form the summary, together with the top key-phrases. We demonstrate that our summaries,
although not in proper prose, are as informative as human-authored summaries, and signif-
icantly better than browsing the home page or the site for a limited time. Our approach
should be easy to transform into proper prose by human editors without having to browse
the web site. The performance of our method depends on the availability of sufficient narra-
tive content in the web site, and the availability of explicit narrative statements describing
the site.
Several issues need to be addressed to further improve the performance of our approach.
29
• Currently the top 1000 (or all pages between depth 1 and depth 4, inclusively) Web
pages of a Web site are crawled for text extraction. Supervised learning may be used
instead to determine the most appropriate number of pages to crawl. Appropriate
attributes for this may include page depth, page length, or part-of-speech tags. Also
during the current crawling process, only Web pages in ASCII coding are kept, while
pages, which consist of binary contents such as movie clip, flash, are discarded. Such
binary content may be a good indicator of the site’s contents, hence it can be collected,
analyzed and included as part of a summary.
• Currently the system (mainly written in Java) is running on a UNIX machine with 8
processors (400MHz UltraSPARC II) and 3GB Memory. In general, the amount of time
required for the URL Extraction and Text Extraction steps depends on the throughput
of the Internet connection. There is an average of 17000 paragraphs (including sentence
segments) in the text parts of top 1000 Web pages. Long paragraph classification takes
about one minute. Usually it takes 3 seconds for the part-of-speech tagger [7] (written
in C) to tag a text file with around 100 words in this environment. So tagging an
average of 5000 long paragraphs can last as long as 4 hours. It takes about three
minutes to identify 1500 narrative paragraphs. Key-phrase extraction takes about 10
minutes, and key-sentence extraction needs about a minute. So more than 80% of
computing time is spent in tagging long paragraphs.
• In the key-term extraction step, we simply combine any two of top 100 candidate
key-words. More sophisticated methods, such as the C-value/NC-value method [12]
will be considered to automatically recognize multi-word terms and then measure their
30
frequencies for the purpose of extracting key multi-word terms.
• Research in [8] indicates that assigning higher weight to anchor text may provide better
results in search engines. Further research is required to determine appropriate weights
for the key-words from different categories (plain text, anchor text and special text).
• Different subjects gave different marks to the same summary (or home page, site),
indicating the potential presence of an “inter-rater reliability” [27] problem. Redesign
of the evaluation process to reduce the inter-rater reliability problem is a topic for
future research. Intrinsic evaluation should also be considered.
