Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
What is The Internet?
• The Internet is a global 
connection of computers.
• These computers are 
connected through Wide 
Area Network (WAN).
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
The Internet Usages
• Exchange of data, news and opinion.
• Upload and download files.
• Electronic Mail (E-Mail)
• Communicate and socialize
• Marketing
• Online banking
• Online shopping
• Entertainment
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
History of The Internet
• The Internet originated in the late 1960s when the 
United States Defense Department developed 
ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency 
network), an experimental network of computers 
designed to withstand partial outages such as a 
bomb attack. 
• The agency sought to create a web of computers that 
could continue to communicate with each other, even 
if some of the computers were disabled.
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
History of The Internet
• In the mid-1980s, when desktop computer 
workstations became increasingly popular, 
organizations wanted to connect their local area 
networks (LANs) to ARPAnet. If computers could link 
together and share resources, everyone would 
benefit.
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
History of The Internet
• 1991 was a big year for the Internet: The National 
Research and Education Network (NREN) was 
founded and the World Wide Web was released. 
• The Internet is still dominated by scientists and other 
academics, but begins to attract public interest.
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
History of The Internet
• With the release of the Mosaic Web browser in 1993 
and Netscape in 1994, interest in and use of the 
World Wide Web exploded. 
• More and more communities become wired, enabling 
direct connections to the Internet. 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
How Does the Internet Works?
• The unique thing about the Internet is that it allows 
many different computers to connect and talk to each 
other. 
• This is possible because of a set of standards, known 
as protocols, that govern the transmission of data 
over the network: TCP/IP (Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol). 
• All computers must use same protocol.
• To gain access to the Internet, the user need to 
register to any Internet Service Provider (ISP).
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
How Does the Internet Works?
• Each computer on the Internet is called the host 
computer. 
• Many of the host computer on the internet offer 
services to other computers on the Internet. 
• Computer which provides services for other 
computers is called server. 
• A host computer may run mail servers, web server, 
FTP server, IRC server, etc.
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
The Internet Requirements
• Computer with modem / network card
• Internet connection
• Account with Internet Service Provider (ISP)
• Web browser
– Example: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera
• 3rd-party software
– Example: Flash player, QuickTime Player, Adobe 
Reader 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• Dialup is naturally the slowest type of connection to 
the Internet. It runs over analog telephone lines, and 
its speed is limited by the quality of these lines, which 
were designed for low-quality voice calls, not data 
transmissions. Dialup relies on modems (modulator-
demodulators), which max out at 57600 bps (in 
practice, 53000 bps). 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) is a digital 
connection over a conventional telephone line. 
• It is not in common use, because it has been 
supplanted by DSL. 
• ISDN offers speeds up to twice as fast as dialup. 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• DSL (digital subscriber line) sends signals on a higher 
frequency than voice signals over telephone lines. It offers high 
speeds, but bandwidth degrades as the length of the telephone 
line increases from the modem to the telephone company's 
central office
• DSL comes in two flavours: 
– ADSL - Asynchronous DSL means that uploading is much 
slower than downloading. Internet service providers (ISPs) 
adopt this technology so that they can spend less on 
bandwidth and so that they discourage users from running 
bandwidth-intensive servers. 
– SDSL - Synchronous DSL provides equally fast 
upstream/downstream bandwidth. SDSL is expensive and 
generally used by businesses hosting web servers. 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• Cable uses television coaxial cable to connect to the 
Internet. 
• Cable has the potential to offer very high speeds, but 
is limited because cable is shared in a 
neighbourhood. 
• If the aggregate bandwidth being used by customers 
exceeds the bandwidth of the physical cable 
connection in a neighbourhood, then slowdowns are 
observed. 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• Satellite also comes in two types: 
– Modem-Satellite - A modem is used to send 
upstream data requests, while a dish receives 
data from a satellite. This method is plagued by 
latency, as it takes a long time for a request to 
travel via dial-up to the web server in question, 
and for the response to arrive through the satellite 
system. 
– Satellite two-way - The satellite dish sends and 
receives data. This technology is more recent, but 
still suffers from latency problems, simply because 
satellites are far away. 
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet
Internet Connections
• Corporations may use T1, T3, and above for hosting 
web servers, serving office users, and so forth. 
• These lines are dedicated digital trunks, reliable, and 
fast, but prohibitively expensive for home users.

Internet Applications
• An Internet application is an interactive, compiled 
application that can be accessed through a 
corporate or through the . 
• Internet applications can perform complex business 
processes on either the client or the server. 
• In a server-based Internet application, the 
application uses the Internet protocol to receive 
requests from a client, typically a Web browser, 
process associated code, and return data to the 
browser.

• The World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of 
accessing information over the medium of the Internet. 
• It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the 
Internet. 
• The Web uses the HTTP (HyperText 
Transfer Protocol), only one of the 
languages spoken over the Internet, 
to transmit data.
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Internet and World Wide 
Web
Internet Applications - World Wide Web
• The Web also utilizes browsers, such as Internet 
Explorer or Firefox, to access Web documents called Web 
pages that are linked to each other via hyperlinks.
• The web documents are formatted in a markup language 
called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that 
supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, 
audio, and video files.
