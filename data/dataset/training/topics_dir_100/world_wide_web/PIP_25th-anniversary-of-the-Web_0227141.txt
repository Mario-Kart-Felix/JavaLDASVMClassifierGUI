About This Report 
This report is the first part of a sustained effort through 2014 by the Pew Research Center to mark 
the 25th anniversary of the creation of the World Wide Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Lee wrote a 
paper on March 12, 1989 proposing an “information management” system that became the 
conceptual and architectural structure for the Web.  He eventually released the code for his system 
—for free—to the world on Christmas Day in 1990. It became a milestone in easing the way for 
ordinary people to access documents and interact over a network of computers called the internet 
—a system that linked computers and that had been around for years. The Web became especially 
appealing after Web browsers were perfected in the early 1990s to facilitate graphical displays of 
pages on those linked computers.  
It thus became a major layer of the internet. Indeed, for many, it became synonymous with the 
internet, even though that is not technically the case. The internet is rules (protocols) that enable 
computer networks to communicate with each other. The Web is a service that uses the network to 
allow computers access files and pages that are hosted on other computers. Other applications that 
are different from the Web also exploit the internet’s architecture to facilitate such things as email, 
some kinds of instant messaging, and peer-to-peer activities like internet phone calling through 
services like Skype or file sharing through torrent services.  
Using the Web—browsing it, searching it, sharing on it—has become the main activity for 
hundreds of millions of people around the globe. Its birthday offers an occasion to revisit the ways 
it has made the internet a part of Americans’ social lives. 
This first report looks back at the rapid change in internet penetration over the last quarter 
century, and covers new survey findings about Americans’ generally positive evaluations of the 
internet’s impact on their lives and personal relationships. In the coming months, the Pew 
Research Center’s Internet Project in association with Elon University's Imagining the Internet 
Project will further mark the 25th anniversary of the Web by releasing eight reports about 
emerging trends in digital technology that are based on surveys of experts about the future of such 
things as privacy, cybersecurity, the “internet of things,” and net neutrality. We will also explore 
some of the economic change driven by the spectacular progress that made digital tools faster and 
cheaper. And we will report on whether Americans feel that the explosion of digital information 
coursing through their lives has helped them be better informed and make better decisions.

Summary of Findings 
The World Wide Web turns 25 on March 12, 2014. It is one of the most important and heavily-
used parts of the network of computer networks that make up the internet. Indeed, the invention 
of the Web by Sir Tim Berners-Lee was instrumental in turning the internet from a geeky data-
transfer system embraced by specialists and a small number of enthusiasts into a mass-adopted 
technology easily used by hundreds of millions around the world.1 
The Web’s birthday provides an occasion to take stock of the impact of the rapid growth of the 
internet since its invention and the attendant rise of mobile connectivity. Since 1995, the Pew 
Research Center has 
documented this explosive 
adoption of the internet and 
its wide-ranging impacts on 
everything from: the way 
people get, share, and create 
news; the way they take care of 
their health; the way they 
perform their jobs; the way 
they learn; the nature of their 
political activity; their 
interactions with government; 
the style and scope of their 
communications with friends 
and family;  and the way they 
organize in communities. 
 
 
                                                        
1 The internet and the Web are not the same thing. The Web is a service that uses the internet’s architecture 
and is technologically distinct from some other internet functions such as email and peer-to-peer file 
sharing. In our survey questions, we broadly use the word “internet” when we are asking about what people 
do online. Many of the things people report to us involve Web activities, even if respondents do not 
necessarily know that is the layer of the internet they are using. As a result, it is a common practice for us in 
this report and earlier work to use the words “internet” and “Web” interchangeably, even though they are 
different things.

% 
 
In a new national survey to mark the 25th anniversary of the Web, Pew Research finds further 
confirmation of the incredible spread and impact of the internet: 
Adoption: 87% of American adults now 
use the internet, with near-saturation usage 
among those living in households earning 
$75,000 or more (99%), young adults ages 
18-29 (97%), and those with college degrees 
(97%). Fully 68% of adults connect to the 
internet with mobile devices like 
smartphones or tablet computers. 
The adoption of related technologies has 
also been extraordinary: Over the course of 
Pew Research Center polling, adult 
ownership of cell phones has risen from 
53% in our first survey in 2000 to 90% 
now. Ownership of smartphones has grown 
from 35% when we first asked in 2011 to 
58% now. 
Impact: Asked for their overall judgment about the impact of the internet, toting up all the pluses 
and minuses of connected life, the public’s verdict is overwhelmingly positive:  
 90% of internet users say the internet has been a good thing for them personally and only 
6% say it has been a bad thing, while 3% volunteer that it has been some of both. 
 76% of internet users say the internet has been a good thing for society, while 15% say it 
has been a bad thing and 8% say it has been equally good and bad.  
Digital technology is viewed as increasingly essential 
We asked the adults who use basic technologies whether it would be hard to give them up and 
users of the internet and mobile phones made clear those technologies feel increasingly essential, 
while more traditional technologies like landline phones and television are becoming easier to part 
with: 
Has the internet been a good thing or a bad

 53% of internet users 
say the internet would 
be, at minimum, “very

amounts to 46% of all 
adults who now say 
the internet would be 
very hard to give up. 
 49% of cell phone 
owners say the same 
thing about their cell, 
up from to 43% in 
2006. That amounts 
to 44% of all adults 
who now say cell 
phones would be very hard to give up. 
 Overall, 35% of all adults say their television would be very hard to give up, a share that has 
dipped from 44% who said that in 2006.  
 28% of landline telephone owners say their phone would be very hard to give up, a major 
drop from 2006 when 48% of landline owners said it would be very hard to give up their 
wired phone. That amounts to 17% of all adults who now say their landline phones would 
be very hard to give up. 
In addition to this enthusiasm, a notable share of Americans say the internet is essential to them. 
Among those internet users who said it would be very hard to give up net access, most (61% of this 
group) said being online was essential for job-related or other reasons. Translated to the whole 
population, about four in ten adults (39%) feel they absolutely need to have internet access. 
Among those most deeply tied to the internet, about half as many (some 30%) said it would be 
hard to give up access because they simply enjoy being online.

% 
Most internet users think online communication has strengthened their relationships and 
the majority report the environment is kind  
There is considerable debate about whether online communication—through email, messaging, or 
social media—has strengthened or weakened relationships. Internet users’ own verdict is 
overwhelmingly positive when it comes to their own ties to family and friends: 67% of internet 
users say their online communication with family and friends has generally strengthened those 
relationships, while 18% say it generally weakens those relationships. 
Interestingly enough, there are no significant demographic differences tied to users’ feelings about 
the impact of online communication on relationships. Equal proportions of online men and 
women, young and old, rich and poor, highly educated and less-well educated, veterans and 
relative newbies say by 3-to-1 or better that online communication is a relationship enhancer, 
rather than a relationship detractor. 
Asked for a broad perspective about the civility 
or incivility they have either witnessed or 
encountered during their online tenure, 76% of 
internet users said the people they witnessed or 
encountered online were mostly kind and 13% 
said people were mostly unkind.  
People were also considerably more likely to say 
they themselves had been treated kindly than 
they had been treated unkindly or attacked. And 
internet users were more likely to say online 
group behavior they had seen had been helpful, 
rather than harmful.  
 70% of internet users say they had been 
treated kindly or generously by others 
online. That compares with 25% who say 
they have been treated unkindly or been 
attacked.  
 56% of internet users say they have seen an online group come together to help a person or 
a community solve a problem. That compares with 25% who say they have left an online

About this survey 
The results in this report are based on data from telephone interviews conducted by Princeton 
Survey Research Associates International from January 9-12, 2014, among a sample of 1,006 
adults, age 18 and older. Telephone interviews were conducted in English and Spanish by landline 
and cell phone. For results based on the total sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the 
error attributable to sampling is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. For results based on internet 
users (N=857), the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

Part 1: How the internet has woven itself into American life 
In possibly the first survey of its kind, in 1983, polling firm Louis Harris & Associates asked U.S. 
adults if they had a personal computer at home and, if so, if they used it to transmit information 
over telephone lines.2 Just 10% of adults said they had a home computer and, of those, 14% said 
they used a modem to send and receive information. The resulting estimate was that 1.4% of U.S. 
adults used the internet. 
Personal computer owners were then asked, “Would your being able to send and receive messages 
from other people...on your own home computer be very useful to you personally?” Some 23% of 
the computer owners said it would be very useful, 31% said it would be somewhat useful, and 45% 
of those early computer users said it would not be very useful. And 74% of computer owners 
agreed with the statement, “The trouble with purchasing and bill-paying by computer is that it will 
be too easy to buy too many things that aren't in the family budget.” 
Looking back, this should come as no surprise. A blinking cursor on a blank screen was not exactly 
an invitation to dream, at least by most people’s estimates. The internet would remain a clunky, 
text-based resource for another six years. 
In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee changed all that by introducing the concept of a “distributed hypertext 
system,” which could link files in an ever-expanding network shaped more like a cobweb than like 
a chain or tree structure, as was standard at the time. The World Wide Web was born. 
Within a year, the Pew Research Center fielded its first question about computer use in a national 
survey. In February 1990, 42% of U.S. adults said they used a personal computer, even if only 
rarely. Men and women were about equally as likely to use computers, as were whites and blacks. 
College graduates were the most likely group to say they use computers on a regular basis: 46%, 
compared with 16% of those who had completed high school. 
But counting the number of computer users was not going to cut it among people who took the 
internet’s potential seriously.  
In 1994, Donna Hoffman and Thomas Novak, professors at the Owen Graduate School of 
Management at Vanderbilt University, wrote, “Current approaches to estimating the number of 
                                                        
2 Survey by Southern New England Telephone. Methodology: Conducted by Louis Harris & Associates, September 1-
September 11, 1983 and based on telephone interviews with a national adult sample of 1,256. Data provided by The 
Roper Center for Public Opinion Research, University of Connecticut.

users of the internet are akin to estimating the number of people in the U.S. by sampling the 
number of buildings, without regard to their function or contents. We propose a completely 
different way—rather than inferring the number of users by counting and sampling machines, 
sample the users themselves.”3 
The computer connection 
In 1995, the Pew Research Center did just that, finding 14% of U.S. adults with internet access.4 
Most were using slow, dial-up modem connections—just 2% of internet users were comparatively 
screaming along with an expensive 28.8 modem. 
To put things into further perspective, 42% of U.S. adults had never heard of the internet and an 
additional 21% were vague on the concept—they knew it had something to do with computers and 
that was about it. Yet even then, 63% of people who used a computer at home said they would miss 
it “a lot” if they no longer had one.  
Early researchers were not too far off the mark, however, focusing on computer penetration into 
American households, schools, and businesses. Twenty-five years ago, anyone who wanted to use 
the internet needed to have access to a computer. Again, in 1990, 42% of U.S. adults said they used 
a computer at their workplace, at school, at home, or anywhere else, even if only occasionally.  
Now, eight in ten U.S. adults (81%) say they use laptop and desktop computers somewhere in their 
lives—at home, work, school, or someplace else.

Education has always been a significant factor when it comes to predicting someone’s likelihood to 
use a computer. In both the 1990 and the current sample, there is about a 30 percentage point gap 
in computer use between adults with a college degree and adults with a high school diploma. Age 
is also a durable predictor for computer use: 56% of adults ages 65 and older now say they use a 
computer, compared with 89% of 18-29 year olds, for example.

Cell phones and mobile connectivity 
Nowadays, desktop or laptop computer access is no longer a prerequisite for internet access. 
Ninety percent of U.S. adults have a cell phone and two-thirds of those say they use their phones to 
go online. One third of cell phone owners say that their primary internet access point is their 
phone, not some other device such as a desktop or laptop computer.

The Pew Research Center’s earliest measure of cell phone ownership was in 2000, when 53% of 
U.S. adults said they had a cell phone. 
Education is less of a factor in predicting cell phone ownership than in predicting computer use: 
93% of adults with a college degree have a cell phone, compared with 87% of adults with a high 
school education or less. Age, however, is a factor: 98% of 18-29 year-olds say they have a cell 
phone, compared with 74% of adults ages 65 and older.

Internet adoption over time 
Adding all of these access points together, 87% of U.S. adults say they use the internet, at least 
occasionally—the highest percentage captured in a Pew Research Center poll since we began 
measuring it in 1995, when just 14% of U.S. adults had access.

The latest findings illustrate remarkable growth in internet adoption across all demographic 
groups. Yet, there still are notable differences in adoption: Those ages 65 and older are 
considerably less likely to use the internet than younger Americans; those with college degrees are 
more likely than those with high school diplomas or no high school diploma to be online; and 
those in higher-income households are more likely to be online than less well-off Americans. More

Another way to look at the increasing importance of the internet is to look at the frequency with 
which people go online. Seventy-one percent of all American adults say they use the internet on a 
typical day. This is a significant increase from the year 2000, our first measure, when just 29% all 
adults said they went online on a typical day.  
The vast majority of internet users go online from home on a typical day—90% say that, up from 
76% in 2000. The percentage of internet users who go online from work has not changed as much 
in the past 15 years: 44% of internet users say they go online from work on a typical day in 2014, 
compared with 41% of internet users who said that in 2000.  
The rise of mobile device use represents the biggest shift in access over the past ten years: 68% of 
U.S. adults now say they access the internet on a cell phone, tablet, or other mobile device, at least 
occasionally.  
All of this data covers the mechanics of the internet’s spread— the how of access—but it doesn’t 
address why people flocked online.  
Is it because they could access a seemingly limitless amount of information? Is it because they 
could communicate, in real time, with friends and family across the globe? Is it because they could 
share their deep expertise in a subject? Is it because they really liked that cute boy and wanted to 
know if he is single? Like the parable of the blind men describing an elephant—one feels the leg 
and says it is like a pillar, another feels the tail and says it is like a rope—people’s experiences of 
the internet are highly subjective. Instead of guessing at why people were drawn to it, or were 
required to start using it, we asked people to assess the role of the internet in their lives more 
generally.

Part 2: Americans’ views about the role of the internet in 
their lives 
In addition to asking people about their internet adoption, Pew Research explored user attitudes 
about the role of various technologies in their lives. We started with a dependency question: How 
hard would it be for users to give up various technologies in their lives? The survey shows that 
older technologies like television and landline phones are losing stature as essential technologies 
and the internet and cell phones have risen as key technologies 
for users: 
 53% of internet users say the internet would be, at 
minimum, very hard to give up, compared with 38% in 
2006.5 That amounts to 46% of all adults who say now 
that the internet would be very hard to give up. Online 
women are somewhat more likely than online men to say 
this (56% vs. 48%) and those with higher levels of 
education and household income are more likely than 
others to report it would be difficult to give up the 
internet. In addition, longtime internet veterans are more 
likely than relative newcomers to say the internet would 
be very hard to give up: 62% of those who started online 
in 1999 or sooner say so, compared with 46% of those 
who started online in the 21st Century.  
 49% of cell phone owners say their cell would be, at 
minimum, very hard to give up, compared with 43% in 
2006. That amounts to 44% of all adults who say now 
that their cell phone would be very hard to give up. The 
cell phone users who live in households earning $75,000 
or more are most likely to report this: 59% say it would 
be very hard, notably more than those in lower income 
households. In addition, the cell owners ages 30-49 are more likely than other age groups 
to say they would have a very hard time giving up their cells. 
                                                        
5 For each technology, a small share of respondents volunteered the answer that the technology would be 
“impossible” to give up. For these calculations, those answers were added to those who said the technology 
would be “very hard” to give up.

% 
 35% of all adults say their television would be very hard to give up, compared with 44% 
who said that in 2006. And the numbers are particularly 
striking for young adults: Only 12% of those ages 18-29 
say television would be very hard to give up.  
 36% of internet users say email would be very hard to 
give up, similar to the 34% who said that in 2006. That 
amounts to 31% of adults who say now that email would 
be very hard to give up. Those who live in higher-income 
households and college graduates are more likely to be 
wedded to email than those in lower-income households 
and those without college degrees. And longtime internet 
veterans (those who first went online in 1999 or sooner) 
are more likely than those who went online more recently 
to say email would be very hard to give up (44% vs. 30%).  
 28% of landline telephone owners say their phone would 
be very hard to give up, a major drop from 48% in 2006. 
The current reading means that 17% of all adults would 
find their landline very hard to give up. Women who own 
landlines are more likely than men to say their wired 
phone would be very hard to give up (34% vs. 20%). 
Those ages 65 and older are the most likely to say it 
would be very hard for them to lose their landline: 46%, 
compared with 7% of those ages 18-29.  
 11% of internet users say social media would be very hard to give up. That comes to 10% of 
all adults. This is the first time we have asked this question, so there are no trend data to 
report.  
The chart below shows the varying levels of enthusiasm for different technologies among their 
users.

In addition to this enthusiasm, a notable share of Americans say the internet is essential to them. 
Among those internet users who said it would be very hard to give up net access, most (61% of this 
group) said being online was essential for job-related or other reasons. Translated to the whole 
population, about four in ten adults (39%) feel they absolutely need to have internet access. 
Among those most deeply tied to the internet, about half as many (some 30%) said it would be 
hard to give up access because they simply enjoy being online. And 7% said both reasons applied to 
them—it is essential and enjoyable in equal measure.  
The internet’s social impact 
There is considerable debate about whether people’s use of the internet has enriched their 
relationships or not and whether the online environment is friendly or menacing. We asked 
questions about that and found that for the American public, the balance sheet is considerably 
more positive than negative.

Young adult internet users—those ages 18-29—are more likely than older internet users to say they

were unpleasant to each other (28% vs. 22%). There were not statistically significant differences 
between online women and men when it comes to being treated unkindly or attacked by someone 
online.  
Asked for a broad perspective about the civility or incivility they have either witnessed or 
encountered during all of their online tenure, 76% of internet users said that the people they 
witnessed or encountered online were mostly kind and 13% said people were mostly unkind. Some 
6% said both kindness and unkindness were there in equal measure. Interestingly, the oldest 
internet users (ages 65+) were the most likely to say people were mostly kind—85% of them said 
so.  
The impact of online communication on relationships 
There is considerable discussion about whether people’s use of the internet has made their 
relationships richer or more superficial. 
On this 25th anniversary of the web survey, we 
also asked internet users for their own 
summary judgment and by a more than 3-t0-1 
margin they say they think their online 
communication has generally made them 
socially richer: 67% of internet users say their 
online communication with family and friends 
has generally strengthened  those relationships, 
while 18% say it generally weakens those 
relationships.  
Interestingly enough, there are no significant 
demographic differences tied to users’ feelings 
about the impact of online communication on 
relationships.  
Equal proportions of online men and women, 
young and old, rich and poor, highly educated 
and less-well educated, and veterans and relative newbies say by 3-to-1 or better that online 
communication is a relationship enhancer, rather than a relationship detractor.

For society For me
Good thing Bad thing Some of both
% 
The overall verdict: The internet has been a plus for society and an especially good thing 
for individual users 
 As the web reaches this benchmark, we asked internet users: “Overall, when you add up all the 
advantages and disadvantages of the internet, would you say the internet has mostly been a good 
thing or a bad thing for society?”  By a 76%-15% 
margin, internet users said the internet has 
been good for society and another 8% 
volunteered the answer that they believe it had 
been both good and bad.  
This sweeping judgment came across the board 
among different demographic groups of 
internet users.  
Then we asked about the users themselves: 
“Overall, when you add up all the advantages 
and disadvantages of the internet, would you 
say the internet has mostly been a good thing or 
a bad thing for you?” And the margin of 
affirmation was even bigger: 90% of internet 
users say that overall the internet had been a 
good thing for them and 6% said it was a bad 
thing. Another 3% volunteered the answer that 
it had been both good and bad for them.  
Moving across the demographic spectrum, this overwhelmingly positive view applies to all major 
groups.

6 The definition of an internet user varies from survey to survey. Prior to January 2005, internet users were 
defined as those who said yes to “Do you ever go online to access the Internet or World Wide Web or to send 
and receive email?” From January 2005 thru February 2012, an internet user is someone said yes to either 
“Do you use the internet, at least occasionally?” (INTUSE) OR “Do you send or receive email, at least 
occasionally?” (EMLOCC). From April 2012 thru December 2012, an internet user is someone said yes to 
any of three questions: INTUSE, EMLOCC or “Do you access the internet on a cell phone, tablet or other 
mobile handheld device, at least occasionally?” (INTMOB). In May 2013, half the sample was asked 
INTUSE/EMLOCC/INTMOB and half was asked EMINUSE/INTMOB. Those May 2013 trend results are for 
both forms combined.

This survey is based on telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 
1,006 adults living in the continental United States. Telephone interviews were conducted by 
landline (502) and cell phone (504, including 288 without a landline phone). The survey was 
conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International (PSRAI). Interviews were done 
in English and Spanish by Princeton Data Source from January 9 to 12, 2014. Statistical results are 
weighted to correct known demographic discrepancies. The margin of sampling error for the 
complete set of weighted data is ± 3.5 percentage points.
