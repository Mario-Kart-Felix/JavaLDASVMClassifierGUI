The World-Wide Web:
summary 
The following gives an overview of the World-Wide Web:
1. Introduction: 
Description / definition of the WWW 
and its relation with the Internet
2. Client programs that allow you to use the WWW
3. How to save selected information from the WWW to 
your computer?
4. The success of the WWW

The World-Wide Web:
prerequisites 
Before using the WWW you should ideally already have 
learned to understand and to use
• computer hardware
• computer software
• the Internet
• older methods for online communication, such as telnet
4
The WWW: 
example of a welcome page

?? Question ??
Indicate some difference between 
telnet and the World-Wide Web?
Indicate so e difference between 
telnet and the orld- ide eb?

The WWW: 
views on information space 
• Unlike telnet and ftp, the WWW offers a view on one 
virtually unified but decentralized information space.
• Selecting a server, and switching from one server to 
another is easier than with telnet and ftp.
• A client program for the WWW can be used to search for 
information held on a distributed network of WWW 
hosts / servers.
• A WWW client has a seamless view of the information, 
even though this information is distributed over many 
different hosts. 
***-

URL = 
Universal Resource Locator
• = draft standard for specifying an object on the Internet
• the structure is in most cases
protocol://computer_address[/path_name/file_name]
• examples:
»telnet://biblio.vub.ac.be
»ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/
»gopher://gopher.vub.ac.be/
»http://www.vub.ac.be/BIBLIO/index.html
»news://news.server.edu/comp.infosystems.www

URL
format / structure
1. The first part of a URL, before the colon “:”, specifies the 
access method = protocol
2. The second part of the URL, after the colon “:”, is 
interpreted specific to the access method. 
In general, two slashes after the colon 
indicate a machine /computer name.

WWW = World Wide Web = W3: 
description
• The WWW provides a hypertext-hypermedia interface to 
information resources in the Internet.
So WWW is a distributed hypermedia system.
• The basis of the WWW was developed at CERN 
(the European Laboratory for Particle Physics) 
in Switzerland by Tim Berners-Lee and co-workers.

The WWW is an application of 
Internet 
****
• The World-Wide Web (WWW) is a service, an 
application of Internet. 
• It is based on the Internet infrastructure. 
• So the WWW is newer than the Internet. 
The concept of the WWW was created at the end of the 
1980s when the Internet was already well established. 
14
The WWW is an application of 
Internet: scheme

WWW
15
The WWW: 
the essential elements
• Information delivery and access using 
hypertext/hypermedia documents/objects
»html documents
»http protocol:      http clients                         http servers 
• Integration of protocols in the Internet:
»http servers offering html documents including links to 
other http servers, telnet servers, ftp servers, nntp servers, 
gopher servers...
****
16
The WWW: 
function
• The WWW works by establishing hypertext/hypermedia 
links between documents anywhere on the network. 
• A document might include many links to other documents 
held on many different servers. 
• Selecting any one of those links will take you to the 
related document wherever it is. 
e.g. the references at the end of a paper might have 
hypertext links to the actual documents held elsewhere.
***-
17
Computer 1
The WWW: 
hyperlinks
Hyperlinks can link a part of a hypermedia document to
• another part of the same document file
• another document file on the same server computer
• another document file on a server computer located 
elsewhere in the world
****
Computer 2
18
The WWW: 
hypertext mark-up language = HTML
• Hypertext mark-up language = HTML = 
the system of codes used by authors to build the 
hypertext-pages/files in WWW, for instance to create a 
title or an anchor.
• The codes are invisible / transparent for the user / reader.

The WWW: 
hypertext transfer protocol = HTTP
• Hypertext transfer protocol = HTTP = 
the software conventions used by client and server 
programs for WWW to request and transfer hypermedia 
documents.
• The protocol must not be known by he user / reader 
= the protocol is invisible / transparent for the user.
• Analogous with the telnet, ftp and gopher protocol.

****
WWW        = HTTP +....
Internet            =     TCP/IP +....
24
The WWW: 
pages and forms
• Pages
Many documents developed for WWW are kept small and 
are named “pages”.
These often refer to several other “pages”.
• Forms = gateways to services and databases on server 
computers in WWW 
Some pages contain electronic forms, to be filled in by the 
user. 
****
25
The WWW
applications
Analogous to gopher applications:
• Access to online public access catalogues
• Campus-wide information systems
• Access to subject-oriented information
• Access to computer file archives
• Traveling / navigating through the Internet 
via linked html-pages
• Access to intranets within institutes / companies
****
26
The WWW: Which information 
is offered via the WWW?
• Many types of information formats
• Many types of information contents ( = on many subjects)
Examples: 
»sources on communications & telecommunications:
http://www.analysys.co.uk/commslib.htm/
»the home page of a broadcasting company:
http://www.vpro.nl/
**--Examples
27
PURL = Persistent URL: 
introduction
• Some URLs have the word 
"PURL" 
located in the early part of the URL.
• To obtain a PURL the owner has had to register the site 
with an intermediary PURL service.
If for any reason the site moves addresses, the owner can 
register the change of address with the PURL service 
which then redirects any users to the new URL.
**--
28
PURL = Persistent URL: 
advantages
• A PURL address 
should not lead to a dead link and 
should mean that the same URL will always point to the 
same resource, even if (behind the scenes) the resource 
has been moved from server to server.
• So a PURL is a clue that the owner of the resource is 
committed to keeping the site stable and persistently 
available via a given URL.

WWW client programs
****
32
WWW: 
client / browse programs
• To access the WWW, you run a browser program. 
• The browser reads documents, and can fetch documents 
from other sources. Information providers set up 
hypermedia servers which browsers can get documents 
from. 
• The browser can display hypertext documents. 
Hypertext is text with pointers to other text. The browsers 
let you deal with the pointers in a transparent way: 
select the pointer, and you are presented with the text 
that is pointed to. 
****
33
WWW: 
types of client programs (browsers)
To access WWW, you can use 
»a browser on a network server computer that can be 
telnetted to, or
»a browser on your own machine
(for instance the microcomputer you use)
**--
34
WWW: 
browsers accessible by telnet
• Example of client programs  (browsers) to access WWW, 
running on Unix computers, in character mode: lynx
• Example of a public access browser accessible by telnet: 
at the following server computer: info.cern.ch
No password is required.

information from computers
****
• The WWW has quickly become the most popular medium 
to access information that resides on various computers 
that are connected to a computer network.
83
?? Question ??
Which positive properties have 
made WWW so popular so fast?
hich positive properties have 
ade  so popular so fast?
***-
84
WWW properties leading to its 
success, related to access (Part 1)
• The client-server architecture that is used in the web 
allows the user to choose a browser client program.
• Browser client programs are available free of charge.
• The WWW is accessible from computers with most 
operating systems.
• The WWW offers an easy to use interface to various 
complex services, based on hypertext/hypermedia.
• The multimedia contents are attractive.
***-
85
WWW properties leading to its 
success, related to access (Part 2)
• Access to multimedia contents is easy, because browser 
programs include viewer software for several formats.
• The WWW makes it easy to switch from one server to 
another transparently (“browsing / navigating /surfing”). 
• Subject trees and indexes exist, to guide the user to 
relevant information sources.
• Much of the information that can be retrieved through 
the WWW is available free of charge.
***-
86
WWW properties leading to its 
success, related to access (Part 3)
• WWW browser client programs also offer access to 
anonymous ftp, gopher, WAIS and other databases which 
were made accessible through WWW, e-mail, Usenet 
newsgroups,...
***-
87
WWW properties leading to its 
success, related to publication (Part 1)
• The WWW is rather well standardised, but still evolving 
and improving.
• The WWW is based on an open, published and freely 
applicable standard / protocol (named “http”).
• Some good http server software packages are available 
free of charge.
• Some good programs to create information pages suitable 
for use through the WWW, with  HTML, are available 
free of charge.
***-
88
WWW properties leading to its 
success, related to publication (Part 2)
• It is relatively easy to create HTML pages.
• Not only text, but multimedia contents can be published.
• The WWW allows the incorporation of Internet 
information sources and services that already existed 
before the WWW; for instance anonymous ftp, gopher,
