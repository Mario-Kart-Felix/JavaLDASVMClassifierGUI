Legal, Ethical, and Professional
Issues in Information Security
In civilized life, law floats in a sea of ethics.
EARL WARREN, CHIEF JUSTICE OF
THE UNITED STATES, 12 NOVEMBER 1962
Henry Magruder made a mistake—he left a CD at the coffee station. Later, when Iris
Majwubu was topping off her mug with fresh tea, hoping to wrap up her work on the
current SQL code module before it was time to go home, she saw the unlabeled CD on
the counter. Being the helpful sort, she picked it up, intending to return it to the person
who’d left it behind.
Expecting to find perhaps the latest device drivers, or someone’s work from the development
team’s office, Iris slipped the disk into the drive of her computer and ran a virus scan on its
contents before opening the file explorer program. She had been correct in assuming the CD
contained data files, and lots of them. She opened a file at random: names, addresses, and
Social Security numbers appeared on her screen. These were not the test records she
expected; they looked more like critical payroll data. Concerned, she found a readme.txt file
and opened it. It read:
Jill, see files on this disc. Hope they meet your expectations. Wire money
to account as arranged. Rest of data sent on payment.
Iris realized that someone was selling sensitive company data to an outside information
broker. She looked back at the directory listing and saw that the files spanned the range of

every department at Sequential Label and Supply—everything from customer lists to ship-
ping invoices. She saw one file that appeared to contain the credit card numbers of every
Web customer the company supplied. She opened another file and saw that it only con-
tained about half of the relevant data. Whoever did this had split the data into two parts.
That made sense: payment on delivery of the first half.
Now, who did this belong to? She opened up the file properties option on the readme.txt
file. The file owner was listed as “hmagruder.” That must be Henry Magruder, the devel-
oper two cubes over in the next aisle. Iris pondered her next action.

Upon completion of this material, you should be able to:
• Describe the functions of and relationships among laws, regulations, and professional
organizations in information security
• Differentiate between laws and ethics
• Identify major national laws that affect the practice of information security
• Explain the role of culture as it applies to ethics in information security
Introduction
As a future information security professional, you must understand the scope of an organiza-
tion’s legal and ethical responsibilities. The information security professional plays an impor-
tant role in an organization’s approach to managing liability for privacy and security risks. In
the modern litigious societies of the world, sometimes laws are enforced in civil courts, where
large damages can be awarded to plaintiffs who bring suits against organizations. Sometimes
these damages are punitive—assessed as a deterrent. To minimize liability and reduce risks
from electronic and physical threats, and to reduce all losses from legal action, information
security practitioners must thoroughly understand the current legal environment, stay current
with laws and regulations, and watch for new and emerging issues. By educating the manage-
ment and employees of an organization on their legal and ethical obligations and the proper
use of information technology and information security, security professionals can help keep
an organization focused on its primary objectives.
In the first part of this chapter, you learn about the legislation and regulations that affect the
management of information in an organization. In the second part, you learn about the ethical
issues related to information security, and about several professional organizations with estab-
lished codes of ethics. Use this chapter as both a reference to the legal aspects of information
security and as an aide in planning your professional career.
Law and Ethics in Information Security
In general, people elect to trade some aspects of personal freedom for social order. As Jean-
Jacques Rousseau explains in The Social Contract, or Principles of Political Right1, the rules
the members of a society create to balance the individual rights to self-determination against
the needs of the society as a whole are called laws. Laws are rules that mandate or prohibit

certain behavior; they are drawn from ethics, which define socially acceptable behaviors.
The key difference between laws and ethics is that laws carry the authority of a governing body,
and ethics do not. Ethics in turn are based on cultural mores: the fixed moral attitudes or cus-
toms of a particular group. Some ethical standards are universal. For example, murder, theft,
assault, and arson are actions that deviate from ethical and legal codes throughout the world.
Organizational Liability and the Need for Counsel
What if an organization does not demand or even encourage strong ethical behavior from its
employees? What if an organization does not behave ethically? Even if there is no breach of
criminal law, there can still be liability. Liability is the legal obligation of an entity that
extends beyond criminal or contract law; it includes the legal obligation to make restitution,
or to compensate for wrongs committed. The bottom line is that if an employee, acting with
or without the authorization of the employer, performs an illegal or unethical act that causes
some degree of harm, the employer can be held financially liable for that action. An organiza-
tion increases its liability if it refuses to take measures known as due care. Due care standards
are met when an organization makes sure that every employee knows what is acceptable or
unacceptable behavior, and knows the consequences of illegal or unethical actions. Due dili-
gence requires that an organization make a valid effort to protect others and continually
maintains this level of effort. Given the Internet’s global reach, those who could be injured
or wronged by an organization’s employees could be anywhere in the world. Under the U.S.
legal system, any court can assert its authority over an individual or organization if it can
establish jurisdiction—that is, the court’s right to hear a case if a wrong is committed in its
territory or involves its citizenry. This is sometimes referred to as long arm jurisdiction—the
long arm of the law extending across the country or around the world to draw an accused
individual into its court systems. Trying a case in the injured party’s home area is usually
favorable to the injured party.2
Policy Versus Law
Within an organization, information security professionals help maintain security via the
establishment and enforcement of policies. These policies—guidelines that describe acceptable
and unacceptable employee behaviors in the workplace—function as organizational laws,
complete with penalties, judicial practices, and sanctions to require compliance. Because these
policies function as laws, they must be crafted and implemented with the same care to ensure
that they are complete, appropriate, and fairly applied to everyone in the workplace. The dif-
ference between a policy and a law, however, is that ignorance of a policy is an acceptable
defense. Thus, for a policy to become enforceable, it must meet the following five criteria:
● Dissemination (distribution)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that the
relevant policy has been made readily available for review by the employee. Common
dissemination techniques include hard copy and electronic distribution.
● Review (reading)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that it disseminated
the document in an intelligible form, including versions for illiterate, non-English read-
ing, and reading-impaired employees. Common techniques include recordings of the
policy in English and alternate languages.
● Comprehension (understanding)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that
the employee understood the requirements and content of the policy. Common techni-
ques include quizzes and other assessments.

● Compliance (agreement)—The organization must be able to demonstrate that the
employee agreed to comply with the policy through act or affirmation. Common
techniques include logon banners, which require a specific action (mouse click or
keystroke) to acknowledge agreement, or a signed document clearly indicating the
employee has read, understood, and agreed to comply with the policy.
● Uniform enforcement—The organization must be able to demonstrate that the policy
has been uniformly enforced, regardless of employee status or assignment.
Only when all of these conditions are met can an organization penalize employees who violate
the policy without fear of legal retribution.
Types of Law
Civil law comprises a wide variety of laws that govern a nation or state and deal with the
relationships and conflicts between organizational entities and people. Criminal law
addresses activities and conduct harmful to society, and is actively enforced by the state.
Law can also be categorized as private or public. Private law encompasses family law, com-
mercial law, and labor law, and regulates the relationship between individuals and organiza-
tions. Public law regulates the structure and administration of government agencies and their
relationships with citizens, employees, and other governments. Public law includes criminal,
administrative, and constitutional law.
Relevant U.S. Laws
Historically, the United States has been a leader in the development and implementation of
information security legislation to prevent misuse and exploitation of information and infor-
mation technology. The implementation of information security legislation contributes to a
more reliable business environment, which in turn, enables a stable economy. In its global
leadership capacity, the United States has demonstrated a clear understanding of the impor-
tance of securing information and has specified penalties for people and organizations that
breach U.S. civil statutes. The sections that follow present the most important U.S. laws that
apply to information security.
General Computer Crime Laws
There are several key laws relevant to the field of information security and of particular inter-
est to those who live or work in the United States. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of
1986 (CFA Act) is the cornerstone of many computer-related federal laws and enforcement
efforts. It was amended in October 1996 by the National Information Infrastructure Protec-
tion Act of 1996, which modified several sections of the previous act and increased the penal-
ties for selected crimes. The punishment for offenses prosecuted under this statute varies from
fines to imprisonment up to 20 years, or both. The severity of the penalty depends on the
value of the information obtained and whether the offense is judged to have been committed:
1. For purposes of commercial advantage
2. For private financial gain
3. In furtherance of a criminal act

The previous law, along with many others, was further modified by the USA PATRIOT Act
of 2001, which provides law enforcement agencies with broader latitude in order to combat
terrorism-related activities. In 2006, this act was amended by the USA PATRIOT Improve-
ment and Reauthorization Act, which made permanent fourteen of the sixteen expanded
powers of the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in investigating terrorist activity.
The act also reset the date of expiration written into the law as a so-called sunset clause for
certain wiretaps under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), and revised
many of the criminal penalties and procedures associated with criminal and terrorist activities.3
Another key law is the Computer Security Act of 1987. It was one of the first attempts to
protect federal computer systems by establishing minimum acceptable security practices. The
National Bureau of Standards, in cooperation with the National Security Agency, is responsi-
ble for developing these security standards and guidelines.
Privacy
Privacy has become one of the hottest topics in information security at the beginning of the
21st century. Many organizations are collecting, swapping, and selling personal information
as a commodity, and many people are looking to governments for protection of their privacy.
The ability to collect information, combine facts from separate sources, and merge it all with
other information has resulted in databases of information that were previously impossible to
set up. One technology that was proposed in the past was intended to monitor or track pri-
vate communications. Known as the Clipper Chip, it used an algorithm with a two-part key
that was to be managed by two separate government agencies, and it was reportedly
designed to protect individual communications while allowing the government to decrypt sus-
pect transmissions.4 This technology was the focus of discussion between advocates for per-
sonal privacy and those seeking to enable more effective law enforcement. Consequently,
this technology was never implemented by the U.S. government.
In response to the pressure for privacy protection, the number of statutes addressing an indi-
vidual’s right to privacy has grown. It must be understood, however, that privacy in this con-
text is not absolute freedom from observation, but rather is a more precise “state of being
free from unsanctioned intrusion.”5 To help you better understand this rapidly evolving
issue, some of the more relevant privacy laws are presented here.
Privacy of Customer Information Some regulations in the U.S. legal code stipulate
the responsibilities of common carriers (organizations that process or move data for hire) to
protect the confidentiality of customer information, including that of other carriers. The
Privacy of Customer Information Section of the common carrier regulation states that any
proprietary information shall be used explicitly for providing services, and not for any mar-
keting purposes, and that carriers cannot disclose this information except when necessary to
provide their services. The only other exception is when a customer requests the disclosure
of information, and then the disclosure is restricted to that customer’s information only.
This law does allow for the use of aggregate information, as long as the same information
is provided to all common carriers and all carriers possessing the information engage in fair
competitive business practices. Aggregate information is created by combining pieces of non-
private data—often collected during software updates and via cookies—that when combined
may violate privacy.
While common carrier regulation regulates public carriers in order to protect individual pri-
vacy, the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 regulates government agencies and holds them

accountable if they release private information about individuals or businesses without per-
mission. The following agencies, regulated businesses, and individuals are exempt from
some of the regulations so that they can perform their duties:
● Bureau of the Census
● National Archives and Records Administration
● Congress
● Comptroller General
● Federal courts with regard to specific issues using appropriate court orders
● Credit reporting agencies
● Individuals or organizations that demonstrate that information is necessary to protect
the health or safety of that individual
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 is a collection of statutes that regulates
the interception of wire, electronic, and oral communications. These statutes work in con-
junction with the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects individuals
from unlawful search and seizure.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Of 1996 (HIPAA), also known as
the Kennedy-Kassebaum Act, protects the confidentiality and security of health care data
by establishing and enforcing standards and by standardizing electronic data interchange.
HIPAA affects all health care organizations, including doctors’ practices, health clinics,
life insurers, and universities, as well as some organizations that have self-insured
employee health programs. HIPAA specifies stiff penalties for organizations that fail to comply
with the law, with fines up to $250,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment for knowingly
misusing client information. Organizations were required to comply with the act by April 14,
2003.6
How does HIPAA affect the field of information security? Beyond the basic privacy guide-
lines, the act requires organizations to use information security mechanisms, as well as poli-
cies and procedures, to protect health care information. It also requires a comprehensive
assessment of information security systems, policies, and procedures where health care infor-
mation is handled or maintained. Electronic signatures have become more common, and
HIPAA provides guidelines for the use of these signatures based on security standards that
ensure message integrity, user authentication, and nonrepudiation. There is no specification
of particular security technologies for each of the security requirements, only that security
must be implemented to ensure the privacy of the health care information.
The privacy standards of HIPAA severely restrict the dissemination and distribution of pri-
vate health information without documented consent. The standards provide patients with
the right to know who has access to their information and who has accessed it. The stan-
dards also restrict the use of health information to the minimum necessary for the health
care services required.
HIPAA has five fundamental principles:
1. Consumer control of medical information
2. Boundaries on the use of medical information
3. Accountability for the privacy of private information

4. Balance of public responsibility for the use of medical information for the greater good
measured against impact to the individual
5. Security of health information
Best known for its allocation of $787 million to stimulate the U.S. economy, the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) includes new legisla-
tion that broadens the scope of HIPAA and gives HIPAA investigators direct,
monetary incentives to pursue violators. The HIPAA-specific parts of ARRA are
found in the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act (HITECH), which Congress included in the overall ARRA legislation.
HITECH broadens the scope of HIPAA to cover all business associates of Health
Care Organizations (HCOs). This means that any accounting firm, legal firm, IT
consultancy, or other business partner of an HCO must comply with HIPAA
security mandates to protect PHI.
Effective February 2010, organizations face the same civil and legal penalties
that doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies face for violating the HIPAA
Privacy Rule. HITECH not only changes how fines will be levied, it also raises
the upper limit on the fines that can be imposed. An HCO or business partner
who violates HIPAA may have to pay fines reaching as high as $1.5 million per
calendar year. In addition, private citizens and lawyers can now sue to collect
fines for security breaches. Overall, HITECH considerably increases the potential
financial liability of any organization that mishandles the PHI that passes
through its IT infrastructure.
The HITECH Act also includes new data breach notification rules that apply
to HCOs and business partners. If an employee discovers a PHI security breach,
the employee’s organization has only 60 days in which to notify each individual
whose privacy has been compromised. If the organization is unable to contact
ten or more of the affected individuals, it must either report the security breach
on its Web site or issue a press release about the breach to broadcast and print
media. If the breach affects 500 or more individuals, the organization must addi-
tionally notify the Security of the HHS, along with major media outlets. The
HHS will then report the breach on its own Web site.7
The Financial Services Modernization Act or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 contains a
number of provisions focusing on facilitating affiliation among banks, securities firms, and
insurance companies. Specifically, this act requires all financial institutions to disclose their
privacy policies on the sharing of nonpublic personal information. It also requires due notice
to customers, so that they can request that their information not be shared with third par-
ties. In addition, the act ensures that the privacy policies in effect in an organization are
both fully disclosed when a customer initiates a business relationship, and distributed at
least annually for the duration of the professional association.
See Table 3-1 for a summary of information security-related laws.
Identity Theft Related to the legislation on privacy is the growing body of law on iden-
tity theft. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) describes identity theft as “occurring when
someone uses your personally identifying information, like your name, Social Security num-
ber, or credit card number, without your permission, to commit fraud or other crimes.”8
The FTC estimates that perhaps as many as nine million Americans are faced with identity

theft each year. Many people, among them perhaps you or someone you know have been
affected by some form of identity theft.9 Organizations can also be victims of identity theft
by means of URL manipulation or DNS redirection, as described in Chapter 2. In May of
2006, President Bush signed an executive order creating the Identity Theft Task Force,
which on April 27, 2007 issued a strategic plan to improve efforts of the government and
private organizations and individuals in combating identity theft. The U.S. FTC now over-
sees efforts to foster coordination among groups, more effective prosecution of criminals
engaged in these activities, and methods to increase restitution made to victims.10
While numerous states have passed identity theft laws, at the federal level the primary legis-
lation is the Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Identification Documents,
Authentication Features, and Information (Title 18, U.S.C. § 1028), which criminalizes crea-
tion, reproduction, transfer, possession, or use of unauthorized or false identification docu-
ments or document-making equipment. The penalties for such offenses range from 1 to
25 years in prison, and fines as determined by the courts.

The FTC recommends that people take the following four steps when they suspect they are
victims of identity theft:
1. Report to the three dominant consumer reporting companies that your identity is threat-
ened so that they may place a fraud alert on your record. This informs current and
potential creditors to follow certain procedures before taking credit-related actions.
2. If you know which accounts have been compromised, close them. If new accounts are
opened using your identity without your permission, you can obtain a document tem-
plate online that may be used to dispute these new accounts. The FTC offers a compre-
hensive identity theft site to provide guidance, tools, and forms you might need at www.
ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft.
3. Register your concern with the FTC. There is a form to register a complaint at the
FTC’s identity theft site.
4. Report the incident to either your local police or police in the location where the identity theft
occurred. Use your copy of the FTC ID Theft complaint form to make the report. Once your
police report has been filed, be sure to get a copy or acquire the police report number.11
Export and Espionage Laws
To meet national security needs and to protect trade secrets and other state and private
assets, several laws restrict which information and information management and security
resources may be exported from the United States. These laws attempt to stem the theft of
information by establishing strong penalties for these crimes.
To protect American ingenuity, intellectual property, and competitive advantage, Congress
passed the Economic Espionage Act in 1996. This law attempts to prevent trade secrets
from being illegally shared.
The Security and Freedom through Encryption Act of 1999 provides guidance on the use of
encryption and provides protection from government intervention. The acts include provi-
sions that:
● Reinforce an individual’s right to use or sell encryption algorithms, without concern
for regulations requiring some form of key registration. Key registration is the storage
of a cryptographic key (or its text equivalent) with another party to be used to break
the encryption of data. This is often called “key escrow.”
● Prohibit the federal government from requiring the use of encryption for contracts,
grants, and other official documents and correspondence.
● State that the use of encryption is not probable cause to suspect criminal activity.
● Relax export restrictions by amending the Export Administration Act of 1979.
● Provide additional penalties for the use of encryption in the commission of a
criminal act.
As illustrated in Figure 3-1, the distribution of many software packages is restricted to
approved organizations, governments, and countries.
U.S. Copyright Law
Intellectual property is a protected asset in the United States. The U.S. copyright laws extend
this privilege to the published word, including electronic formats. Fair use allows copyrighted
materials to be used to support news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and a number of

Financial Reporting
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is a critical piece of legislation that affects the executive man-
agement of publicly traded corporations and public accounting firms. This law seeks to improve
the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting, as well as increase the accountability of corpo-
rate governance, in publicly traded companies. Penalties for non-compliance range from fines to
jail terms. Executives working in firms covered by this law seek assurance on the reliability and
quality of information systems from senior information technology managers. In turn, IT man-
agers are likely to ask information security managers to verify the confidentiality and integrity
of those information systems in a process known in the industry as sub-certification.
Freedom of Information Act of 1966 (FOIA)
The Freedom of Information Act allows any person to request access to federal agency
records or information not determined to be a matter of national security. Agencies of the
federal government are required to disclose any requested information on receipt of a written
request. This requirement is enforceable in court. Some information is, however, protected
from disclosure, and the act does not apply to state or local government agencies or to pri-
vate businesses or individuals, although many states have their own version of the FOIA.

State and Local Regulations
In addition to the national and international restrictions placed on organizational use of com-
puter technology, each state or locality may have a number of its own applicable laws and
regulations. Information security professionals must therefore understand state laws and reg-
ulations and ensure that the organization’s security policies and procedures comply with
those laws and regulations.
For example, in 1991 the state of Georgia passed the Georgia Computer Systems Protection
Act, which seeks to protect information, and which establishes penalties for the use of infor-
mation technology to attack or exploit information systems.
International Laws and Legal Bodies
It is important for IT professionals and information security practitioners to realize that when
their organizations do business on the Internet, they do business globally. As a result, these
professionals must be sensitive to the laws and ethical values of many different cultures, socie-
ties, and countries. While it may be impossible to please all of the people all of the time, deal-
ing with the laws of other states and nations is one area where it is certainly not easier to ask
for forgiveness than for permission.
A number of different security bodies and laws are described in this section. Because of the
political complexities of the relationships among nations and the differences in culture, there
are currently few international laws relating to privacy and information security. The laws dis-
cussed below are important, but are limited in their enforceability. The American Society of
International Law is one example of an American institution that deals in international law
(see www.asil.org).
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime
The Council of Europe adopted the Convention on Cybercrime in 2001. It created an inter-
national task force to oversee a range of security functions associated with Internet activities
for standardized technology laws across international borders. It also attempts to improve the
effectiveness of international investigations into breaches of technology law. This convention
has been well received by advocates of intellectual property rights because it emphasizes prose-
cution for copyright infringement. However, many supporters of individual rights oppose the
convention because they think it unduly infringes on freedom of speech and threatens the civil
liberties of U.S. residents.
While thirty-four countries attended the signing in November 2001, only twenty-nine nations,
including the United States, have ratified the Convention as of April 2010. The United
States is technically not a “member state of the council of Europe” but does participate in the
Convention.
As is true with much complex international legislation, the Convention on Cybercrime lacks
any realistic provisions for enforcement. The overall goal of the convention is to simplify the
acquisition of information for law enforcement agencies in certain types of international
crimes. It also simplifies the extradition process. The convention has more than its share of
skeptics, who see it as an overly simplistic attempt to control a complex problem.

Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), created by
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and negotiated over the years 1986–1994, introduced
intellectual property rules into the multilateral trade system. It is the first significant interna-
tional effort to protect intellectual property rights. It outlines requirements for governmental
oversight and legislation of WTO member countries to provide minimum levels of protection
for intellectual property. The WTO TRIPS agreement covers five issues:
● How basic principles of the trading system and other international intellectual prop-
erty agreements should be applied
● How to give adequate protection to intellectual property rights
● How countries should enforce those rights adequately in their own territories
● How to settle disputes on intellectual property between members of the WTO
● Special transitional arrangements during the period when the new system is being
introduced12
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is the American contribution to an interna-
tional effort by the World Intellectual Properties Organization (WIPO) to reduce the impact
of copyright, trademark, and privacy infringement, especially when accomplished via the
removal of technological copyright protection measures. This law was created in response to
the 1995 adoption of Directive 95/46/EC by the European Union, which added protection
for individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the use and movement of
such data. The United Kingdom has implemented a version of this law called the Database
Right, in order to comply with Directive 95/46/EC.
The DMCA includes the following provisions:
● Prohibits the circumvention protections and countermeasures implemented by copy-
right owners to control access to protected content
● Prohibits the manufacture of devices to circumvent protections and countermeasures
that control access to protected content
● Bans trafficking in devices manufactured to circumvent protections and countermea-
sures that control access to protected content
● Prohibits the altering of information attached or imbedded into copyrighted material
● Excludes Internet service providers from certain forms of contributory copyright
infringement
Ethics and Information Security
Many Professional groups have explicit rules governing ethical behavior in the workplace. For
example, doctors and lawyers who commit egregious violations of their professions’ canons of
conduct can be removed from practice. Unlike the medical and legal fields, however, the infor-
mation technology field in general, and the information security field in particular, do not

have a binding code of ethics. Instead, professional associations—such as the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Information Systems Security Association—and certifi-
cation agencies—such as the International Information Systems Security Certification Consor-
tium, Inc., or (ISC)2—work to establish the profession’s ethical codes of conduct. While these
professional organizations can prescribe ethical conduct, they do not always have the author-
ity to banish violators from practicing their trade. To begin exploring some of the ethical
issues particular to information security, take a look at the Ten Commandments of Computer
Ethics in the nearby Offline.
Ethical Differences Across Cultures
Cultural differences can make it difficult to determine what is and is not ethical—especially
when it comes to the use of computers. Studies on ethics and computer use reveal that people
of different nationalities have different perspectives; difficulties arise when one nationality’s
ethical behavior violates the ethics of another national group. For example, to Western cul-
tures, many of the ways in which Asian cultures use computer technology is software
piracy.14 This ethical conflict arises out of Asian traditions of collective ownership, which
clash with the protection of intellectual property. Approximately 90 percent of all software
is created in the United States. Some countries are more relaxed with intellectual property
copy restrictions than others.
A study published in 1999 examined computer use ethics of eight nations: Singapore, Hong
Kong, the United States, England, Australia, Sweden, Wales, and the Netherlands.15 This

study selected a number of computer-use vignettes (see the Offline titled The Use of Scenarios
in Computer Ethics Studies) and presented them to students in universities in these eight
nations. This study did not categorize or classify the responses as ethical or unethical.
Instead, the responses only indicated a degree of ethical sensitivity or knowledge about the
performance of the individuals in the short case studies. The scenarios were grouped into
three categories of ethical computer use: software license infringement, illicit use, and misuse
of corporate resources.
Software License Infringement The topic of software license infringement, or
piracy, is routinely covered by the popular press. Among study participants, attitudes
toward piracy were generally similar; however, participants from the United States and the
Netherlands showed statistically significant differences in attitudes from the overall group.
Participants from the United States were significantly less tolerant of piracy, while those
from the Netherlands were significantly more permissive. Although other studies have
reported that the Pacific Rim countries of Singapore and Hong Kong are hotbeds of soft-
ware piracy, this study found tolerance for copyright infringement in those countries to be
moderate, as were attitudes in England, Wales, Australia, and Sweden. This could mean
that the individuals surveyed understood what software license infringement was, but felt
either that their use was not piracy, or that their society permitted this piracy in some way.
Peer pressure, the lack of legal disincentives, the lack of punitive measures, and number of
other reasons could a explain why users in these alleged piracy centers disregarded intellec-
tual property laws despite their professed attitudes toward them. Even though participants
from the Netherlands displayed a more permissive attitude toward piracy, that country only
ranked third in piracy rates of the nations surveyed in this study.
Illicit Use The study respondents unilaterally condemned viruses, hacking, and other
forms of system abuse. There were, however, different degrees of tolerance for such activities
among the groups. Students from Singapore and Hong Kong proved to be significantly more
tolerant than those from the United States, Wales, England, and Australia. Students from
Sweden and the Netherlands were also significantly more tolerant than those from Wales
and Australia, but significantly less tolerant than those from Hong Kong. The low overall
degree of tolerance for illicit system use may be a function of the easy correspondence
between the common crimes of breaking and entering, trespassing, theft, and destruction of
property and their computer-related counterparts.
Misuse of Corporate Resources The scenarios used to examine the levels of toler-
ance for misuse of corporate resources each presented a different degree of noncompany
use of corporate assets without specifying the company’s policy on personal use of com-
pany resources. In general, individuals displayed a rather lenient view of personal use of
company equipment. Only students from Singapore and Hong Kong view personal use
of company equipment as unethical. There were several substantial differences in this cate-
gory, with students from the Netherlands revealing the most lenient views. With the excep-
tions of those from Singapore and Hong Kong, it is apparent that many people, regardless
of cultural background, believe that unless an organization explicitly forbids personal use
of its computing resources, such use is acceptable. It is interesting to note that only partici-
pants among the two Asian samples, Singapore and Hong Kong, reported generally intol-
erant attitudes toward personal use of organizational computing resources. The reasons
behind this are unknown.16

The following vignettes can be used in an open and frank discussion of computer
ethics. Review each scenario carefully and respond to each question using the follow-
ing statement, choosing the description you feel most appropriate: I feel the actions
of this individual were (very ethical / ethical / neither ethical nor unethical / unethical /
very unethical). Then, justify your response.
Ethical Decision Evaluation
Note: These scenarios are based on published works by Professor Whitman and
Professor Paradice.
1. A scientist developed a theory that required proof through the construction of a
computer model. He hired a computer programmer to build the model, and the
theory was shown to be correct. The scientist won several awards for the develop-
ment of the theory, but he never acknowledged the contribution of the computer
programmer.
The scientist’s failure to acknowledge the computer programmer was:
2. The owner of a small business needed a computer-based accounting system. One
day, he identified the various inputs and outputs he felt were required to satisfy
his needs. Then he showed his design to a computer programmer and asked the
programmer if she could implement such a system. The programmer knew she
could implement the system because she had developed much more sophisticated
systems in the past. In fact, she thought this design was rather crude and would
soon need several major revisions. But she didn’t say anything about her thoughts,
because the business owner didn’t ask, and she hoped she might be hired to
implement the needed revisions.
The programmer’s decision not to point out the design flaws was:
3. A student found a loophole in the university computer’s security system that
allowed him access to other students’ records. He told the system administrator
about the loophole, but continued to access others’ records until the problem was
corrected two weeks later.
The student’s action in searching for the loophole was:
The student’s action in continuing to access others’ records for two weeks was:
The system administrator’s failure to correct the problem sooner was:

Ethics and Education
Attitudes toward the ethics of computer use are affected by many factors other than national-
ity. Differences are found among individuals within the same country, within the same social
class, and within the same company. Key studies reveal that the overriding factor in leveling
the ethical perceptions within a small population is education. Employees must be trained
and kept aware of a number of topics related to information security, not the least of which
are the expected behaviors of an ethical employee. This is especially important in information
security, as many employees may not have the formal technical training to understand that
their behavior is unethical or even illegal. Proper ethical and legal training is vital to creating
an informed, well prepared, and low-risk system user.
Deterring Unethical and Illegal Behavior
There are three general causes of unethical and illegal behavior:
● Ignorance—Ignorance of the law is no excuse; however, ignorance of policy and pro-
cedures is. The first method of deterrence is education. This is accomplished by means
of designing, publishing, and disseminating organization policies and relevant laws,
and also obtaining agreement to comply with these policies and laws from all members
of the organization. Reminders, training, and awareness programs keep the policy
information in front of the individual and thus better support retention and
compliance.
● Accident—Individuals with authorization and privileges to manage information
within the organization are most likely to cause harm or damage by accident. Careful
planning and control helps prevent accidental modification to systems and data.
● Intent—Criminal or unethical intent goes to the state of mind of the person performing
the act; it is often necessary to establish criminal intent to successfully prosecute offen-
ders. Protecting a system against those with intent to cause harm or damage is best
accomplished by means of technical controls, and vigorous litigation or prosecution if
these controls fail.
Whatever the cause of illegal, immoral, or unethical behavior, one thing is certain: it is the
responsibility of information security personnel to do everything in their power to deter
these acts and to use policy, education and training, and technology to protect information
and systems. Many security professionals understand the technology aspect of protection but
underestimate the value of policy. However, laws and policies and their associated penalties
only deter if three conditions are present:
● Fear of penalty—Potential offenders must fear the penalty. Threats of informal repri-
mand or verbal warnings may not have the same impact as the threat of imprisonment
or forfeiture of pay.
● Probability of being caught—Potential offenders must believe there is a strong possi-
bility of being caught. Penalties will not deter illegal or unethical behavior unless there
is reasonable fear of being caught.
● Probability of penalty being administered—Potential offenders must believe that the
penalty will in fact be administered.

Codes of Ethics and Professional Organizations
A number of professional organizations have established codes of conduct or codes of ethics
that members are expected to follow. Codes of ethics can have a positive effect on people’s
judgment regarding computer use.17 Unfortunately, many employers do not encourage their
employees to join these professional organizations. But employees who have earned some
level of certification or professional accreditation can be deterred from ethical lapses by the
threat of loss of accreditation or certification due to a violation of a code of conduct. Loss of
certification or accreditation can dramatically reduce marketability and earning power.
It is the responsibility of security professionals to act ethically and according to the policies
and procedures of their employers, their professional organizations, and the laws of society.
It is likewise the organization’s responsibility to develop, disseminate, and enforce its policies.
Following is a discussion of professional organizations and where they fit into the ethical land-
scape. Table 3-2 provides an overview of these organizations. Many of these organizations
offer certification programs that require the applicants to subscribe formally to the ethical
codes. Professional certification is discussed in Chapter 11.
Major IT Professional Organizations
Many of the major IT professional organizations maintain their own codes of ethics.
The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) (www.acm.org) is a respected professional
society that was established in 1947 as “the world’s first educational and scientific computing
society.” It is one of the few organizations that strongly promotes education and provides

discounts for student members. The ACM’s code of ethics requires members to perform their
duties in a manner befitting an ethical computing professional. The code contains specific
references to protecting the confidentiality of information, causing no harm (with specific
references to viruses), protecting the privacy of others, and respecting the intellectual property
and copyrights of others. The ACM also publishes a wide variety of professional computing
publications, including the highly regarded Communications of the ACM.
The International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, Inc. (ISC)2 (www.
isc2.org) is a nonprofit organization that focuses on the development and implementation of
information security certifications and credentials. The (ISC)2 manages a body of knowledge on
information security and administers and evaluates examinations for information security certifi-
cations. The code of ethics put forth by (ISC)2 is primarily designed for information security pro-
fessionals who have earned an (ISC)2 certification, and has four mandatory canons: “Protect
society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure; act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly,
and legally; provide diligent and competent service to principals; and advance and protect the
profession.”18 This code enables (ISC)2 to promote reliance on the ethicality and trustworthiness
of the information security professional as the guardian of information and systems.
The System Administration, Networking, and Security Institute (SANS) (www.sans.org),
which was founded in 1989, is a professional research and education cooperative organiza-
tion with a current membership of more than 156,000 security professionals, auditors, sys-
tem administrators, and network administrators. SANS offers a set of certifications called
the Global Information Assurance Certification, or GIAC. All GIAC-certified professionals
are required to acknowledge that certification and the privileges that come from it carry a
corresponding obligation to uphold the GIAC Code of Ethics. Those certificate holders that
do not conform to this code face punishment, and may lose GIAC certification.
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) (www.isaca.org) is a pro-
fessional association that focuses on auditing, control, and security. The membership com-
prises both technical and managerial professionals. ISACA provides IT control practices and
standards, and although it does not focus exclusively on information security, it does include
many information security components within its areas of concentration. ISACA also has a
code of ethics for its professionals, and it requires many of the same high standards for ethi-
cal performance as the other organizations and certifications.
The Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) (www.issa.org) is a nonprofit society of
information security professionals. As a professional association, its primary mission is to
bring together qualified information security practitioners for information exchange and edu-
cational development. ISSA provides a number of scheduled conferences, meetings, publica-
tions, and information resources to promote information security awareness and education.
ISSA also promotes a code of ethics, similar in content to those of (ISC)2, ISACA, and the
ACM, whose focus is “promoting management practices that will ensure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of organizational information resources.”19
Key U.S. Federal Agencies
A number of key U.S. federal agencies are charged with the protection of American informa-
tion resources and the investigation of threats to, or attacks on, these resources. These
include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(see Figure 3-2), the National Security Administration, the FBI’s Infragard program
(see Figure 3–3), and the U.S. Secret Service (see Figure 3-4).
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in 2003 by the Homeland Security
Act of 2002, which was passed in response to the events of September 11, 2001. DHS is made
up of five directorates, or divisions, through which it carries out its mission of protecting the
people as well as the physical and informational assets of the United States. The Directorate
of Information and Infrastructure creates and enhances resources used to discover and
respond to attacks on national information systems and critical infrastructure. The Science
and Technology Directorate is responsible for research and development activities in support
of homeland defense. This effort is guided by an ongoing examination of vulnerabilities
throughout the national infrastructure, and this directorate sponsors the emerging best prac-
tices developed to counter the threats and weaknesses in the system.
Established in January 2001, the National InfraGard Program began as a cooperative effort
between the FBI’s Cleveland Field Office and local technology professionals. The FBI sought
assistance in determining a more effective method of protecting critical national information

resources. The resulting cooperative, the first InfraGard chapter, was a formal effort to
combat both cyber and physical threats. Since then, every FBI field office has established an
InfraGard chapter and collaborates with public and private organizations and the academic
community to share information about attacks, vulnerabilities, and threats. The National
InfraGard Program serves its members in four basic ways:
● Maintains an intrusion alert network using encrypted e-mail
● Maintains a secure Web site for communication about suspicious activity or intrusions
● Sponsors local chapter activities
● Operates a help desk for questions
InfraGard’s dominant contribution is the free exchange of information to and from the private
sector in the areas of threats and attacks on information resources.

Another key federal agency is the National Security Agency (NSA). The NSA is:
the Nation’s cryptologic organization. It coordinates, directs, and performs
highly specialized activities to protect U.S. information systems and produce
foreign intelligence information … It is also one of the most important centers
of foreign language analysis and research within the Government.20
The NSA is responsible for signal intelligence and information system security. The NSA’s
Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) provides information security “solutions including
the technologies, specifications and criteria, products, product configurations, tools, standards,
operational doctrine, and support activities needed to implement the protect, detect and
report, and respond elements of cyber defense.”21 The IAD also develops and promotes an
Information Assurance Framework Forum in cooperation with commercial organizations and
academic researchers. This framework provides strategic guidance as well as technical specifi-
cations for security solutions. IAD’s Common Criteria is a set of standards designed to pro-
mote understanding of information security.

Prominent among the NSA’s efforts and activities in the information security arena are the
Information Security Outreach programs. The NSA recognizes universities that not only offer
information security education, but that have also integrated information security philosophies
and efforts into the internal operations of the schools. These recognized “Centers of Excel-
lence in Information Assurance Education” receive the honor of displaying the recognition as
well as being acknowledged on the NSA’s Web site. Additionally, the NSA has a program to
certify curricula in information security. The Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation
process examines institutional information security courses and provides a three-year accredi-
tation. Graduates of these programs receive certificates that indicate this accreditation.
The U.S. Secret Service is an agency within the Department of the Treasury. In addition to its
well-known mission of providing protective services for key members of the U.S. government,
the Secret Service is also charged with the detection and arrest of any person committing a
United States federal offense relating to computer fraud and false identification crimes. This is
an extension of the agency’s original mission to protect U.S. currency—a logical extension,
given that the communications networks of the United States carry more funds than all of the
armored cars in the world combined. Protect the networks and protect the data, and you pro-
tect money, stocks, and other financial transactions. For more information on the Secret Ser-
vice, see its Web site (the home page is shown in Figure 3-4).

Chapter Summary
■ Laws are formally adopted rules for acceptable behavior in modern society. Ethics are
socially acceptable behaviors. The key difference between laws and ethics is that laws
carry the authority of a governing body and ethics do not.
■ Organizations formalize desired behaviors in documents called policies. Policies must
be read and agreed to before they are binding.
■ Civil law comprises a wide variety of laws that are used to govern a nation or state.
Criminal law addresses violations that harm society and are enforced by agents of the
state or nation.
■ Private law focuses on individual relationships, and public law governs regulatory agencies.
■ Key U.S. laws protecting privacy include the Federal Privacy Act of 1974, the Elec-
tronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996.
■ The desire to protect national security, trade secrets, and a variety of other state and
private assets has led to several laws restricting what information and information
management and security resources may be exported from the United States.

■ Intellectual property is recognized as a protected asset in this country. U.S. copyright
law extends this privilege to the published word, including electronic media.
■ Studies have determined that individuals of differing nationalities have differing per-
spectives on ethical practices regarding the use of computer technology.
■ Deterrence can prevent an illegal or unethical activity from occurring. Deterrence
requires significant penalties, a high probability of apprehension, and an expectation
of enforcement of penalties.
■ As part of an effort to encourage ethical behavior, a number of professional organiza-
tions have established codes of conduct or codes of ethics that their members are
expected to follow.
■ There are a number of U.S. federal agencies responsible for protecting American infor-
mation resources and investigating threats to, or attacks on, these resources.

Case Exercises
Iris called the company security hotline. The hotline was an anonymous way to report any
suspicious activity or abuse of company policy, although Iris chose to identify herself. The
next morning, she was called to a meeting with an investigator from corporate security,
which led to more meetings with others in corporate security, and then finally a meeting with
the director of human resources and Gladys Williams, the CIO of SLS.
Questions:
1. Why was Iris justified in determining who the owner of the CD was?
2. Should Iris have approached Henry directly, or was the hotline the most effective way
to take action? Why do you think so?
3. Should Iris have placed the CD back at the coffee station and forgotten the whole
thing? Explain why that action would have been ethical or unethical.
