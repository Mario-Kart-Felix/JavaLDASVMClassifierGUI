Introduction
It has been more than 6 years since the publication of the original edition of this book. A great deal
has happened in the world of computer security since that time. This edition is updated to include
newer information, updated issues, and revised content. 
The real question is who is this book for. This book is a guide for any computer-savvy person. That
means system administrators who are not security experts or anyone who has a working knowledge of
computers and wishes to know more about cyber crime and terrorism could find this book useful.
However, the core audience will be students who wish to take a first course in security but may not
have a thorough background in computer networks. The book is in textbook format, making it ideal
for introductory computer security courses that have no specific prerequisites. That lack of prerequi-
sites means that people outside the normal computer science and computer information systems
departments could also avail themselves of a course based on this book. This might be of particular
interest to law enforcement officers, criminal justice majors, and even business majors with an
interest in computer security.
As was previously mentioned, this book is intended as an introductory computer security book. In
addition to the numerous end notes, the appendices will guide you to a plethora of additional
resources. There are also review questions and practice exercises with every chapter.
This book is not a cookbook for hackers. You will see exactly how hackers target a system and get
information about it. You will also see step-by-step instructions on how to use some password
cracking utilities and some network scanning utilities. You will also be given a reasonably in depth
explanation of various hacking attacks. However, you won’t see a specific step-by-step recipe for
executing an attack.
This book assumes that you are a competent computer user. That means you have used a computer at
work and at home, are comfortable with email and web browsers, and know what words like RAM
and USB mean. For instructors considering this as a textbook, that means that students will have had
some basic understanding of PCs, but need not have had formal computer courses. For this reason,
there is a chapter on basic networking concepts to get you up to speed. For readers with more
knowledge, such as system administrators, you will find some chapters of more use to you than
others. Feel free to simply skim any chapter that you feel is too elementary for you.

Introduction to Computer Security 
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Identify the top threats to a network: security breaches, denial of service attacks, and
malware
■ Assess the likelihood of an attack on your network
■ Define key terms such as cracker, sneaker, firewall, and authentication
■ Compare and contrast perimeter and layered approaches to network security
■ Use online resources to secure your network
Introduction
It’s hard to find a facet of modern life that does not involve a computer system, at least on some level.
Online purchases, debit cards, and automatic bill pay are standard parts of modern life. Some retailers
are using computerized automatic checkout. It is even likely that you have taken a class online, and you
may even be using this textbook for a class you are currently taking online. You can, in fact, buy this
book online. I personally purchase most of the books I read online.
Because so much of our business is transacted online, a great deal of personal information is stored in
computers. Medical records, tax records, school records, and more are all stored in computer data-
bases. This leads to some very important questions:
1. How is information safeguarded? 
2. What are the vulnerabilities to these systems?
3. What steps are taken to ensure that these systems and data are safe?

How Seriously Should You Take Threats to Network Security? 3
FYI: Where Is the Internet Going?
Recently there have been more expansions to Internet technology and Internet use. Such expan-
sions include increased transmission speeds, a wider use of wireless Internet, and the growing
phenomenon of online education. Do you think that we will reach a point where all aspects of our
lives have some Internet component? Have we already reached that point?
Recent news stories don’t offer encouraging answers to these questions. The media gives a lot of
attention to dramatic virus attacks, hackers, and other interesting Internet phenomena. Even the most
technically naïve person cannot go more than a few weeks without hearing of some new virus or some
hacking incident. 
In spite of daily horror stories, however, many people (including some law enforcement professionals
and trained computer professionals) lack an adequate understanding about the reality of these threats.
Clearly the media will focus attention on the most dramatic computer security breaches, not neces-
sarily giving an accurate picture of the most plausible threat scenarios. It is not uncommon to even
encounter the occasional system administrator whose knowledge of computer security is inadequate. 
This chapter outlines current dangers, describes the most common types of attacks on your personal
computer and network, teaches you how to speak the lingo of both hackers and security professionals,
and outlines the broad strokes of what it takes to secure your computer and your network.
In this book, you will learn how to secure both individual computers and entire networks. You will also
find out how to secure data transmission, and you will complete an exercise to find out about your
region’s laws regarding computer security. Perhaps the most crucial discussion in this chapter is what
attacks are commonly attempted and how they are perpetrated. In this first chapter we set the stage for
the rest of the book by outlining what exactly the dangers are and introducing you to the terminology
used by both network security professionals and hackers. All of these topics are explored more fully in
subsequent chapters.
How Seriously Should You Take Threats to Network
Security?
The first step in understanding computer and network security is to formulate a realistic assessment of
the threats to those systems. You will need a clear picture of the dangers in order to adequately prepare
a defense. There seem to be two extreme attitudes regarding computer security. The first group
assumes there is no real threat. Subscribers to this belief feel that there is little real danger to computer
systems, and that much of the negative news is simply unwarranted panic. They often believe taking
only minimal security precautions should ensure the safety of their systems. The prevailing sentiment
is, if our organization has not been attacked so far, we must be secure. If decision makers subscribe to
this point of view, they tend to push a reactive approach to security. They will wait to address security
issues until an incident occurs—the proverbial “closing the barn door after the horse has already
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security4
gotten out.” If you are fortunate, the incident will have only minor impact on your organization and will
serve as a much needed wakeup call. If you are unfortunate, then your organization may face serious
and possible catastrophic consequences. One major goal of this book is to encourage a proactive
approach to security.
People who subscribe to the opposite viewpoint overestimate the dangers. They tend to assume that
talented, numerous hackers are an imminent threat to your system. They may believe that any teenager
with a laptop can traverse highly secure systems at will. Such a worldview makes excellent movie
plots, but it is simply unrealistic. The reality is that many people who call themselves hackers are less
knowledgeable than they think they are. These people have a low probability of being able to
compromise any system that has implemented even moderate security precautions. 
This does not mean that skillful hackers do not exist, of course. However, they must balance the costs
(financial, time) against the rewards (ideological, monetary). “Good” hackers tend to target systems
that yield the highest rewards. If a hacker doesn’t perceive your system as beneficial to these goals, he
is less likely to expend the resources to compromise your system. It is also important to understand that
real intrusions into a network take time and effort. Hacking is not the dramatic process you see in
movies. I often teach courses in hacking and penetration testing, and students are usually surprised to
find that the process is actually a bit tedious and requires patience.
Both extremes of attitudes regarding the dangers to computer systems are inaccurate. It is certainly true
that there are people who have the understanding of computer systems and the skills to compromise the
security of many, if not most, systems. A number of people who call themselves hackers, though, are
not as skilled as they claim to be. They have ascertained a few buzzwords from the Internet and may be
convinced of their own digital supremacy, but they are not able to affect any real compromises to even
a moderately secure system. 
The truly talented hacker is no more common than the truly talented concert pianist. Consider how
many people take piano lessons at some point in their lives. Now consider how many of those ever truly
become virtuosos. The same is true of computer hackers. Keep in mind that even those who do possess
the requisite skill need to be motivated to expend the time and effort to compromise your system.
A better way to assess the threat level to your system is to weigh the attractiveness of your system to
potential intruders against the security measures in place. 
Keep in mind, too, that the greatest external threat to any system is not hackers, but malware and denial
of service attacks. Malware includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and logic bombs. And beyond the
external attacks, there is the issue of internal problems due to malfeasance or simple ignorance.
Identifying Types of Threats
Most attacks can be categorized as one of six broad classes:
■ Malware: This is a generic term for software that has a malicious purpose. It includes virus attacks,
worms, adware, Trojan horses, and spyware. This is the most prevalent danger to your system.
ptg999
Identifying Types of Threats 5
■ Security breaches: This group of attacks includes any attempt to gain unauthorized access to
your system. This includes cracking passwords, elevating privileges, breaking into a server…
all the things you probably associate with the term hacking. 
■ Denial of service (DoS) attacks: These are designed to prevent legitimate access to your
system. 
■ Web attacks: This is any attack that attempts to breach your website. Two of the most common
such attacks are SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
■ Session hijacking: These attacks are rather advanced, and involve an attacker attempting to
take over a session.
■ DNS poisoning: This type of attack seeks to compromise a DNS server so that users can be
redirected to malicious websites, including phishing websites.
This section offers a broad description of each type of attack. Later chapters go into greater detail with
each specific attack, how it is accomplished, and how to avoid it. 
Malware
Malware is a generic term for software that has a malicious purpose. This section discusses three types
of malware: viruses, Trojan horses, and spyware. Trojan horses and viruses are the most widely
encountered.
According to Symantec (makers of Norton antivirus and other software products), a virus is “a small
program that replicates and hides itself inside other programs, usually without your knowledge”
(Symantec, 2003). A computer virus is similar to a biological virus; both are designed to replicate and
spread. The most common method for spreading a virus is using the victim’s email account to spread
the virus to everyone in their address book. Some viruses don’t actually harm the system itself, but all
of them cause network slowdowns due to the heavy network traffic caused by the virus replication. 
The Trojan horse gets its name from an ancient tale. The city of Troy was besieged for an extended
period of time. The attackers could not gain entrance, so they constructed a huge wooden horse and one
night left it in front of the gates of Troy. The next morning the residents of Troy saw the horse and
assumed it to be a gift, so they rolled the wooden horse into the city. Unbeknownst to them, several
soldiers where hidden inside the horse. That evening the soldiers left the horse, opened the city gates,
and let their fellow attackers into the city. An electronic Trojan horse works the same way, appearing to
be benign software but secretly downloading a virus or some other type of malware onto your
computer from within. 
Another category of malware currently on the rise is spyware. Spyware is simply software that literally
spies on what you do on your computer. Spyware can be as simple as a cookie—a text file that your
browser creates and stores on your hard drive—that a website you have visited downloads to your
machine and uses to recognize you when you return to the site. However, that flat file can then be read
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security6
by the website or by other websites. Any data that the file saves can be retrieved by any website, so
your entire Internet browsing history can be tracked.
A logic bomb is software that lays dormant until some specific condition is met. That condition is
usually a date and time. When the condition is met, then the software does some malicious act such as
deleting files, altering system configuration, or perhaps releasing a virus. 
Another form of spyware, called a key logger, records all of your keystrokes. Some key loggers also
take periodic screenshots of your computer. Data is then either stored for later retrieval by the person
who installed the key logger or is sent immediately back via email. We will discuss specific types of
key loggers later in this book.
Compromising System Security
Next we will look at attacks that breach your system’s security. This activity is what is commonly
referred to as hacking, though that is not the term hackers themselves use. We will delve into appro-
priate terminology in just a few pages; however, it should be noted at this point that cracking is the
appropriate word for intruding into a system without permission, usually with malevolent intent. Any
attack that is designed to breach your security, either via some operating system flaw or any other
means, can be classified as cracking. 
Social engineering is a technique for breaching a system’s security by exploiting human nature rather
than technology. This was the path that the famous hacker Kevin Mitnick most often used. Social engi-
neering uses standard con techniques to get users to give up the information needed to gain access to a
target system (Lemos, 2000). The way this method works is rather simple: The perpetrator gets prelim-
inary information about a target organization and leverages it to obtain additional information from the
system’s users. 
Following is an example of social engineering in action. Armed with the name of a system adminis-
trator, you might call someone in the business’s accounting department and claim to be one of the
company’s technical support personnel. Mentioning the system administrator’s name would help
validate that claim, allowing you to ask questions in an attempt to ascertain more details about the
system’s specifications. A savvy intruder might even get the accounting person to say a username and
password. As you can see, this method is based on how well the prospective intruder can manipulate
people and actually has little to do with computer skills.
The growing popularity of wireless networks gave rise to new kinds of attacks. One such activity is war-
driving. This type of attack is an offshoot of war-dialing. With war-dialing, a hacker set up a computer
to call phone numbers in sequence until another computer answered to try to gain entry to its system.
War-driving is much the same concept, applied to locating vulnerable wireless networks. In this
scenario, the hacker simply drives around trying to locate wireless networks (Poulsen, 2001). Many
people forget that their wireless network signal often extends as much as 100 feet (thus, past walls). At
the 2004 DefCon convention for hackers, there was a war-driving contest where contestants drove
around the city trying to locate as many vulnerable wireless networks as they could (BlackBeetle, 2004).
ptg999
Assessing the Likelihood of an Attack on Your Network 7
Denial of Service Attacks
In a denial of service (DoS), the attacker does not actually access the system. Rather, he or she simply
blocks access from legitimate users (CERT, 2003). One common way to do prevent legitimate service
is to flood the targeted system with so many false connection requests, that the system cannot respond
to legitimate requests. DoS is probably the most common attack on the Web.
Web Attacks
By their nature, web servers have to allow communications. Oftentimes, websites allow users to
interact with the website. Any part of a website that allows for user interaction is also a potential point
for attempting a web-based attack. SQL injections involve entering SQL (Structured Query Language)
commands into login forms (username and password text fields) in an attempt to trick the server into
executing those commands. The most common purpose is to force the server to log the attacker on,
even though the attacker does not have a legitimate username and password. While SQL injection is
just one type of web attack, it is the most common.
Session Hijacking
Session hijacking can be rather complex to perform. For that reason, it is not a very common form of
attack. Simply put, the attacker monitors an authenticated session between the client machine and the
server, and takes that session over. We will explore specific methods of how this is done later in this
book.
DNS Poisoning
Most of your communication on the Internet will involve DNS, or Domain Name Service. DNS is what
translates the domain names you and I understand (like www.ChuckEasttom.com) into IP addresses
that computers and routers understand. DNS poisoning uses one of several techniques to compromise
that process and redirect traffic to an illicit site, often for the purpose of stealing personal information.
Assessing the Likelihood of an Attack on Your
Network
How likely are these attacks? What are the real dangers facing you as an individual or your organi-
zation? What are the most likely attacks, and what are your vulnerabilities? Let’s take a look at what
threats are out there and which ones are the most likely to cause you or your organization problems.
At one time, the most likely threat to individuals and large organizations was the computer virus. And
it is still true that in any given month, several new virus outbreaks will be documented. This situation
means that new viruses are being created all the time—and old ones are still out there. However, there
are other very common attacks, such as spyware. Spyware is fast becoming as big a problem, even
bigger than viruses.
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security8
After viruses, the most common attack is unauthorized usage of computer systems. Unauthorized
usage includes everything from DoS attacks to outright intrusion of your system. It also includes
internal employees misusing system resources. A recent survey by the Computer Security Institute of
223 computer professionals showed over $445 million in losses due to computer security breaches. In
75% of the cases, an Internet connection was the point of attack, while 33% of the professionals cited
the location as their internal systems. A rather astonishing 78% of those surveyed detected employee
abuse of systems/Internet (Computer Security Institute, 2002). This statistic means that in any organi-
zation, one of the chief dangers might be its own employees. A 2007 study by Jeffery Johnson and Zolt
Ugray, of Utah State University, showed similar problems.
Basic Security Terminology 
Before you embark on the rest of this chapter and this book, it is important to know some basic termi-
nology. The security and hacking terms in this section are merely an introduction to computer security
terminology, but they are an excellent starting point to help you prepare for learning more about
computer security. Additional terms will be introduced throughout the text and listed in the Glossary at
the end of this book.
The world of computer security takes its vocabulary from both the professional security community
and the hacker community. 
Hacker Slang
You probably have heard the term hacker used in movies and in news broadcasts. Most people use it to
describe any person who breaks into a computer system. In the hacking community, however, a hacker
is an expert on a particular system or systems, a person who simply wants to learn more about the
system. Hackers feel that looking at a system’s flaws is the best way to learn about that system. For
example, someone well versed in the Linux operating system who works to understand that system by
learning its weaknesses and flaws would be a hacker. 
This process does often mean seeing if a flaw can be exploited to gain access to a system. This
“exploiting” part of the process is where hackers differentiate themselves into three groups:
■ A white hat hacker, upon finding some flaw in a system, will report the flaw to the vendor of
that system. For example, if they were to discover some flaw in Red Hat Linux, they would
then email the Red Hat company (probably anonymously) and explain exactly what the flaw is
and how it was exploited. White hat hackers are often hired specifically by companies to do
penetration tests. The EC Council even has a certification test for white hat hackers, the Certi-
fied Ethical Hacker test.
■ A black hat hacker is the person normally depicted in the media. Once she gains access to a
system, her goal is to cause some type of harm. She might steal data, erase files, or deface
websites. Black hat hackers are sometimes referred to as crackers.
ptg999
Basic Security Terminology 9
■ A gray hat hacker is normally a law-abiding citizen, but in some cases will venture into illegal
activities.
Regardless of how hackers view themselves, intruding on any system is illegal. This means that techni-
cally speaking all hackers, regardless of the color of the metaphorical hat they may wear, are in violation
of the law. However, many people feel that white hat hackers actually perform a service by finding flaws
and informing vendors before those flaws are exploited by less ethically inclined individuals.
Script Kiddies
A hacker is an expert in a given system, as with any profession it includes its share of frauds. So what
is the term for someone who calls himself or herself a hacker but lacks the expertise? The most
common term for this sort of person is script kiddy (Raymond, 1993). The name comes from the fact
that the Internet is full of utilities and scripts that one can download to perform some hacking tasks.
Many of these tools have an easy-to-use graphical user interface that allows someone with very little if
any skill to operate the tool. A classic example is the Low Earth Orbit Ion Cannon tool for executing a
DoS attack. Someone who downloads such a tool without really understanding the target system is
considered a script kiddy. A significant number of the people you are likely to encounter who call
themselves hackers are, in reality, mere script kiddies. 
Ethical Hacking: Sneakers
When and why would someone give permission to another party to hack his system? The most
common answer is in order to assess system vulnerabilities. This employee, commonly called a
sneaker, legally breaks into a system in order to assess security deficiencies, such as portrayed in the
1992 film Sneakers, starring Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, and Sidney Poitier. More and more
companies are soliciting the services of such individuals or firms to assess their vulnerabilities. 
Anyone hired to assess the vulnerabilities of a system should be both technically proficient and ethical.
Run a criminal background check, and avoid those people with problem pasts. There are plenty of
legitimate security professionals available who know and understand hacker skills but have never
committed security crimes. If you take the argument that hiring convicted hackers means hiring
talented people to its logical conclusion, you could surmise that obviously the person in question is not
as good a hacker as they would like to think, because they were caught.
Most importantly, giving a person with a criminal background access to your systems is on par with
hiring a person with multiple DWI convictions to be your driver. In both cases, you are inviting
problems and perhaps assuming significant civil liabilities.
Also some review of their qualifications is clearly in order. Just as there are people who claim to be
highly skilled hackers yet are not, there are those who will claim to be skilled sneakers yet lack the
skills truly needed. You would not want to inadvertently hire a script kiddy who thinks she is a sneaker.
Such a person might then pronounce your system quite sound when, in fact, it was simply a lack of
skills that prevented the script kiddy from successfully breaching your security. Later in this book, in
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security10
Chapter 11, “Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning,” we discuss the basics of assessing a
target system. In Chapter 11 we also discuss the qualifications you should seek in any consultant you
might hire for this purpose.
Phreaking
One specialty type of hacking involves breaking into telephone systems. This subspecialty of hacking
is referred to as phreaking. The New Hacker’s Dictionary actually defines phreaking as “the action of
using mischievous and mostly illegal ways in order to not pay for some sort of telecommunications
bill, order, transfer, or other service” (Raymond, 2003). Phreaking requires a rather significant
knowledge of telecommunications, and many phreakers have some professional experience working
for a phone company or other telecommunications business. Often this type of activity is dependent
upon specific technology required to compromise phone systems, more than simply knowing certain
techniques.
Professional Terms
Most hacker terminology, as you may have noticed, is concerned with the activity (phreaking) or the
person performing the activity (sneaker). In contrast, security professional terminology describes
defensive barrier devices, procedures, and policies. This is quite logical because hacking is an
offensive activity centered on attackers and attack methodologies, whereas security is a defensive
activity concerning itself with defensive barriers and procedures.
Security Devices
The most basic security device is the firewall. A firewall is a barrier between a network and the outside
world. Sometimes a firewall takes the form of a standalone server, sometimes a router, and sometimes
software running on a machine. Whatever its physical form, a firewall filters traffic entering and exiting
the network. A proxy server is often used with a firewall to hide the internal network’s IP address and
present a single IP address (its own) to the outside world. 
Firewalls and proxy servers guard the perimeter by analyzing traffic (at least inbound and in many
cases outbound as well) and blocking traffic that has been disallowed by the administrator. These two
safeguards are often augmented by an intrusion-detection system (IDS). An IDS simply monitors
traffic, looking for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempted intrusion.
Security Activities
In addition to devices, we have activities. Authentication is the most basic security activity. It is merely
the process of determining if the credentials given by a user or another system (such as a username and
password) are authorized to access the network resource in question. When you log in with your
username and password, the system will attempt to authenticate that username and password. If it is
authenticated, you will be granted access.
ptg999
Concepts and Approaches 11
Another crucial safeguard is auditing, which is the process of reviewing logs, records, and procedures
to determine if these items meet standards. This activity will be mentioned in many places throughout
this book and will be a definite focus in a few chapters.
The security and hacking terms that we have just covered are only an introduction to computer security
terminology, but they provide an excellent starting point that will help you prepare for learning more
about computer security. Additional terms will be introduced throughout the text as needed and
compiled in the Glossary at the end of the book.
Concepts and Approaches
The approach you take toward security influences all subsequent security decisions and sets the tone
for the entire organization’s network security infrastructure. Before we delve into various network
security paradigms, let us take a moment to examine a few concepts that should permeate your entire
thinking about security.
The first concept is the CIA triangle. This does not refer to clandestine operating involving the Central
Intelligence Agency; rather it is a reference to the three pillars of security: confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. When you are thinking about security, your thought processes should always be guided by
these three principles. First and foremost, are you keeping the data confidential? Does your approach
help guarantee the integrity of data? And does your approach still make the data readily available to
authorized users?
Another important concept to keep in mind is least privileges. This literally means that each user or
service running on your network should have the least number of privileges/access required to do their
job. No one should be granted access to anything unless it is absolutely required for their job. In
military and intelligence circles this is referred to as “need to know.”
Network security paradigms can be classified by either the scope of security measures taken
(perimeter, layered) or how proactive the system is. 
In a perimeter security approach, the bulk of security efforts are focused on the perimeter of the
network. This focus might include firewalls, proxy servers, password policies, or any technology or
procedure to make unauthorized access of the network less likely. Little or no effort is put into securing
the systems within the network. In this approach the perimeter is secured, but the various systems
within that perimeter are often vulnerable.
There are additional issues regarding perimeter security that include physical security. That can include
fences, closed-circuit TV, guards, locks, and so on, depending on the security needs of your organi-
zation.
The perimeter approach is clearly flawed, so why do some companies use it? A small organization
might use the perimeter approach if they have budget constraints or inexperienced network adminis-
trators. A perimeter method might be adequate for small organizations that do not store sensitive data,
but it rarely works in a larger corporate setting.
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security12
A layered security approach is one in which not only is the perimeter secured, but individual systems
within the network are also secured. All servers, workstations, routers, and hubs within the network are
secure. One way to accomplish this is to divide the network into segments and secure each segment as
if it were a separate network, so if the perimeter security is compromised, not all the internal systems
are affected. This is the preferred method whenever possible.
You should also measure your security approach by how proactive/reactive it is. This is done by
gauging how much of the system’s security infrastructure and policies is dedicated to preventive
measures and how much of the security system is designed to respond to attack. A passive security
approach takes few or no steps to prevent an attack. A dynamic or proactive defense is one in which
steps are taken to prevent attacks before they occur. 
One example of this defense is the use of intrusion-detection systems (IDS), which work to detect
attempts to circumvent security measures. These systems can tell a system administrator that an
attempt to breach security has been made, even if that attempt is not successful. IDS can also be used
to detect various techniques intruders use to assess a target system, thus alerting a network adminis-
trator to the potential for an attempted breach before the attempt is even initiated.
In the real world, network security is usually not completely in one paradigm or another; it is usually a
hybrid approach. Networks generally include elements of both security paradigms. The two categories
also combine. One can have a network that is predominantly passive but layered, or one that is
primarily perimeter but proactive. It can be helpful to consider approaches to computer security along
a Cartesian coordinate system, as illustrated in Figure 1.1, with the x axis representing the level of
passive-active approaches and the y axis depicting the range from perimeter to layered defense. 
FIGURE 1.1 The security approach guide.
The most desirable hybrid approach is a layered paradigm that is dynamic, which is the upper-right
quadrant of the figure.

How Do Legal Issues Impact Network Security? 13
How Do Legal Issues Impact Network Security?
An increasing number of legal issues affect how one approaches computer security. If your organi-
zation is a publicly traded company, a government agency, or does business with either one, there may
be legal constraints regarding your network security. Even if your network is not legally bound to these
security guidelines, it’s useful to understand the various laws impacting computer security. You may
choose to apply them to your own security standards.
One of the oldest pieces of legislation in the United States that affects computer security is the
Computer Security Act of 1987 (100th Congress, 1987). It requires government agencies to identify
sensitive systems, conduct computer security training, and develop computer security plans. This law
was a vague mandate ordering federal agencies in the United States to establish security measures, but
did not specify any standards.
This legislation established a legal mandate to enact specific standards, paving the way for future
guidelines and regulations. It also helped define terms, such as what information is considered
“sensitive.” This quote is found in the legislation itself:
The term ‘sensitive information’ means any information, the loss, misuse, or unauthorized
access to or modification of which could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct
of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of
title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized
under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the
interest of national defense or foreign policy. (100th Congress, 1987)
This definition of the word sensitive should be kept in mind because it is not just social security infor-
mation or medical history that must be secured. 
When considering what information needs to be secure, simply ask this question: Would the unautho-
rized access or modification of this information adversely affect your organization? If the answer is
yes, then you must consider that information sensitive and in need of security precautions.
Another more specific federal law that applied to mandated security for government systems is OMB
Circular A-130 (specifically, Appendix III). This document required that federal agencies establish
security programs containing specified elements. It also described requirements for developing stan-
dards for computer systems and for records held by government agencies.
Most states have specific laws regarding computer security, such as legislation like the Computer Crimes
Act of Florida, the Computer Crime Act of Alabama, and the Computer Crimes Act of Oklahoma. If you’re
responsible for network security, you might find yourself part of a criminal investigation. This could be an
investigation into a hacking incident or employee misuse of computer resources. A list of computer crime
laws (organized by state) can be found at http://law.findlaw.com/state-laws/computer-crimes/.
ptg999
CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Computer Security14
CAUTION
Privacy Laws
It is also critical to keep in mind that any law that governs privacy (such as the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, HIPAA) also has a direct impact on computer securi-
ty. If your system is compromised, and thus data that is covered under any privacy statute is
compromised, you may need to prove that you exercised due diligence in protecting that data.
If it can be shown that you did not take proper precautions, you might be found civilly liable.
Online Security Resources
As you read this book, and when you move out into the professional world, you will have frequent need
for additional security resources. Appendix B includes a more complete list of resources, but this
section highlights a few of the most important ones you may find useful now.
CERT
The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT, www.cert.org) is sponsored by Carnegie-Mellon
University. CERT was the first computer incident-response team, and it is still one of the most
respected in the industry. Anyone interested in network security should visit the site routinely. On the
website you will find a wealth of documentation, including guidelines for security policies, cutting-
edge security research, and more.
Microsoft Security Advisor
Because so many computers today run Microsoft operating systems, another good resource is the
Microsoft Security Advisor website: www.microsoft.com/security/default.mspx. This site is a portal to
all Microsoft security information, tools, and updates. If you use any Microsoft software, then it is
advised that you visit this website regularly.
F-Secure
The F-Secure corporation maintains a website at www.f-secure.com. This site is, among other things, a
repository for detailed information on virus outbreaks. Here you will not only find notifications about
a particular virus but you will also find detailed information about the virus. This information includes
how the virus spreads, ways to recognize the virus, and frequently, specific tools for cleaning an
infected system of a particular virus.
SANS Institute
The SANS Institute website (www.sans.org) is a vast repository of security-related documentation. On
this site you will find detailed documentation on virtually every aspect of computer security you can
imagine. The SANS Institute also sponsors a number of security research projects and publishes infor-
mation about those projects on their website.

Summary
Network security is a complex and constantly evolving field. Practitioners must stay on top of new
threats and solutions and be proactive in assessing risk and protecting their networks. The first step to
understanding network security is to become acquainted with the actual threats posed to a network.
Without a realistic idea of what threats might affect your systems, you will be unable to effectively
protect them. It is also critical that you acquire a basic understanding of the terminology used by both
security professionals and those who would seek to compromise your security.

Introduction
To be able to manage network security, you will need knowledge about how computer networks
operate. Those readers who already have a strong working knowledge of network operations may
choose to skim this chapter, or perhaps give it a quick read as a review. For other readers new to
computer networking, studying this chapter will give you a basic introduction to how networks and the
Internet work, including a history of the Internet. This understanding of networks and the Internet will
be crucial to your comprehension of later topics presented in this book.
We will begin by examining the basic technologies, protocols, and methods used for networks and the
Internet to communicate. Then we will take a look at the history of the Internet. This information forms

the background knowledge you will need to understand various cyber attacks, and how they are
defended against. In the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will be able to practice using some
protective methods, such as IPConfig, tracert, and ping.
Network Basics
Getting two or more computers to communicate and transmit data is a process that is simple in concept
but complex in application. Consider all the factors involved. First you will need to physically connect
the computers. This connection (although sometimes accomplished by infrared light) usually requires
either a cable that plugs into your computer or wireless connection. The cable then is plugged either
directly to another computer, or is plugged into a device that will, in turn, connect to several other
computers.
Of course, wireless communication is being used with more frequency, and wireless connecting, obvi-
ously, doesn’t require a cable. However, even wireless communication relies on a physical device to
transmit the data. There is a card in most modern computers called a network interface card, or NIC. If
the connection is through a cable, the part of the NIC that is external to the computer has a connection
slot that looks like a telephone jack, only slightly bigger. Wireless networks also use a NIC; but rather
than having a slot for a cable to connect to, the wireless network simply uses radio signals to transmit
to a nearby wireless router or hub. Wireless routers, hubs, and NICs must have an antenna to transmit
and receive signals. These devices are connective devices that will be explained in detail later in this
chapter
The Physical Connection: Local Networks
As mentioned, cables are one of the ways that computers are connected to each other. The cable
connection used with traditional NICs (meaning not wireless) is an RJ-45 connection. (RJ is short for
Registered Jack—which is an international industry standard.) In contrast to the computer’s RJ-45
jacks, standard telephone lines use RJ-11 jacks. The biggest difference between jacks involves the
number of wires in the connector, also called the terminator. Phone lines have four wires, whereas 
RJ-45 connectors have eight.
If you look on the back of most computers or the connection area of a laptop, you will probably find
two ports that, at first glance, look like phone jacks. One of the two ports is probably for a traditional
modem and accepts a standard RJ-11 jack. The other port is larger and accepts an RJ-45 jack. Not all
computers come with a NIC, but most modern computers do.
This standard connector jack must be on the end of the cable. The cable used in most networks today is
a Category 5 cable—abbreviated as Cat 5 cable. (Note that Cat 6 cable is becoming more prevalent
with high-speed networks.) Table 2.1 summarizes the various categories of cable and their uses.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet24
TABLE 2.1 Cable Types and Uses
Category Specifications Uses
1 Low-speed analog (less than 1MHz) Telephone, doorbell
2 Analog line (less than 10MHz) Telephone
3 Up to 16MHz or 100 Mbps (megabits per second) Voice transmissions
4 Up to 20MHz/100Mbps Data lines, Ethernet networks
5 100 MHz/100Mbps Most common type of network cable
6 1000 Mbps Very high-speed networks
7 100 GBPS The latest and fastest
The type of cable used in connecting computers is also often referred to as unshielded twisted-pair
cable (UTP). In UTP, the wires in the cable are in pairs, twisted together without any additional
shielding. As you can see in Table 2.1, each subsequent category of cable is somewhat faster and more
robust than the last. It should be noted that although Cat 4 can be used for networks, it almost never is
used for that purpose, as it is simply slower, less reliable, and an older technology. You will usually see
Cat 5 cable and, increasingly, Cat 6. You should note that we are focusing on UTP because that is what
is found most often. There are other types of cable such as shielded twisted pair (STP), but they are not
nearly as common as UTP.
FYI: Cable Speed
Category 6 cable is for the new Gigabit Ethernet. Cat 5 cable works at speeds of up to 100Mbps,
whereas Cat 6 works at 1000Mbps. Cat 6 is widely available and has been for several years.
However, for Cat 6 to truly function properly, you need hubs/switches, and NICs that also transmit
at gigabit speeds; thus, the spread of gigabit Ethernet has been much slower than many analysts
expected. We will discuss hubs, switches, NICs, and other hardware in more detail later in this
chapter.
As shown in Table 2.1, a key specification is speed, measured in mbps, or megabits per second. You are
probably already aware that ultimately everything in the computer is stored in a binary format—namely,
in the form of a 1 or a 0. These units are called bits. It takes 8 bits, which equals 1 byte, to represent a
single character such as a letter, number, or carriage return. Remember that the data specification for each
cable is the maximum that the cable can handle. A Cat 5 cable can transmit up to 100 mega (million) bits
per second. This is known as the bandwidth of the cable. If multiple users are on a network, all sending
data, that traffic uses up bandwidth rather quickly. Any pictures transmitted also use a lot of bandwidth.
Simple scanned-in photos can easily reach 2 megabytes (2 million bytes, or 16 million bits) or much
more. And streaming media, such as video, is perhaps the most demanding on bandwidth.
If you simply want to connect two computers to each other, you can have the cable go directly from one
computer to the other. You would have to use a crossover cable, but you could connect two computers
directly. But what do you do if you wish to connect more than one computer? What if you have 100
ptg999
Network Basics 25
computers that you need to connect on a network? There are three devices that can help you to accom-
plish this task: the hub, the switch, and the router. These each use Cat 5 or Cat 6 cable with RJ-45
connectors and are explained in the following sections.
The Hub
The simplest connection device is the hub. A hub is a small box-shaped electronic device into which
you can plug network cables. It will have four or more (commonly up to 24) RJ-45 jacks, each called a
port. A hub can connect as many computers as it has ports. (For example, an 8-port hub can connect
eight computers.) You can also connect one hub to another; this strategy is referred to as “stacking”
hubs. Hubs are quite inexpensive and simple to set up; just plug in the cable. However, hubs have a
downside. If you send a packet (a unit of data transmission) from one computer to another, a copy of
that packet is actually sent out from every port on the hub. All these copies leads to a lot of unnecessary
network traffic. This occurs because the hub, being a very simple device, has no way of knowing where
a packet is supposed to go. Therefore, it simply sends copies of the packet out all of its ports. While
you may go to your favorite electronic store and buy something called a “hub,” true hubs no longer
exist. What you are really getting is a switch, which we will discuss next.
Repeater
A repeater is a device used to boost signal. Basically if your cable needs to go further than the
maximum length (which is 100 meters for UTP), then you need a repeater. There are two types of
repeater: amplifier and signal. Amplifier repeaters simply boost the entire signal they receive,
including any noise. Signal repeaters regenerate the signal, and thus don’t rebroadcast any noise.
The Switch
The next connection device option is the switch. A switch is basically an intelligent hub; it works and
looks exactly like a hub, with one significant difference. When a switch receives a packet, it will send
that packet only out the port for the computer to which it needs to go. A switch is essentially a hub that
is able to determine where a packet is being sent. How this determination is made is explained in the
“Data Transmission” section.
The Router
Finally, if you wish to connect two or more networks together, you use a router. A router is similar in
concept to a hub or switch, as it does relay packets; but it is far more sophisticated. You can program
most routers and control how they relay packets. Most routers have interfaces allowing you to
configure them. The more robust routers also offer more programming possibilities. The specifics of
how you program the router are different from vendor to vendor, and there are entire books written
specifically on just programming routers. It is not possible to cover specific router programming tech-
niques in this book; however, you should be aware that most routers are programmable allowing you to
change how they route traffic. Also, unlike using a hub or switch, the two networks connected by a
router are still separate networks. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet26
Faster Connection Speeds
The explanation above covers the connections between computers on a local network, but surely there
are faster connection methods? Well, there are; in fact, your Internet service provider or the company
for which you work probably has a much faster connection to the Internet. Table 2.2 summarizes the
most common high-speed connection types and their speeds.
TABLE 2.2 Internet Connection Types
Connection Type Speed Details
DS0 64Kbps Standard phone line.
ISDN 128Kbps Two DS0 lines working together to provide a high-speed data 
connection.
T1 1.54Mbps Twenty-four DS0 lines working as one. Twenty-three carry data, and
one carries information about the other lines. This type of connection
has become common for schools and businesses. 
T3 43.2Mbps 672 DS0 lines working together. This method is the equivalent of 28
T1 lines.
OC3 155Mbps All OC lines are optical and do not use traditional phone lines. OC3
lines are quite fast and very expensive. They are often found at
telecommunications companies.
OC12 622Mbps The equivalent of 336 T1 lines, or 8,064 phone lines.
OC48 2.5Gbps The equivalent of four OC12 lines.
It is common to find T1 connection lines in many locations. A cable modem can sometimes achieve
speeds comparable to a T1 line. Note that cable modems were not listed on the chart, simply because
their actual speeds vary greatly depending on a variety of circumstances including how many people in
your immediate vicinity are using the same cable modem provider. You are not likely to encounter the
OC lines unless you work in telecommunications.
Data Transmission
We’ve seen, briefly, the physical connection methods; but how is data actually transmitted? To transmit
data, a packet is sent. The basic purpose of a cable is to transmit packets from one machine to another.
It does not matter whether that packet is a part of a document, video, an image, or just some internal
signal from the computer. So what, exactly, is a packet? As we discussed earlier, everything in a
computer is ultimately stored as 1s and 0s, called bits, which are grouped into sets of eight, called a
byte. A packet is a certain number of bytes divided into a header and a body. The header is 20 bytes at
the beginning of the packet that tells you where the packet is coming from, where it is going, and more.
The body contains the actual data, in binary format, that you wish to send. The aforementioned routers
and switches work by reading the header portion of any packets that come to them. This process is how
they determine where the packet should be sent.

Network Basics 27
Protocols
There are different types of network communications for different purposes. The different types of network
communications are called protocols. A protocol is, essentially, an agreed-upon method of communication.
In fact, this definition is exactly how the word protocol is used in standard, noncomputer usage too. Each
protocol has a specific purpose and normally operates on a certain port. (Ports are discussed in more detail
below.) Some of the most important, and most commonly used, protocols are listed in Table 2.3.
TABLE 2.3 TCP/IP Protocols
Protocol Purpose Port
FTP (File Transfer For transferring files between computers. 20 and 21
Protocol)
TFTP (Trivial File A quicker but less-reliable form of FTP. 69
Transfer Protocol)
Telnet Used to remotely log on to a system. 23
You can then use a command prompt 
or shell to execute commands on that 
system. Popular with network administrators.
SMTP (Simple Mail Sends email. 25
Transfer Protocol)
WhoIS A command that queries a target IP 43
address for information.
DNS (Domain Translates URLs into Web addresses. 53
Name Service)
HTTP (Hypertext Displays web pages. 80
Transfer Protocol) 
POP3 (Post Office Retrieves email. 110
Protocol version 3)
NNTP (Network News Used for network news groups (Usenet 119
Transfer Protocol) newsgroups). You can access these groups 
over the Web via www.google.com by selecting 
the Groups tab.
NetBIOS An older Microsoft protocol that is for naming 137, 138, 139
systems on a local network. 
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) Used for chat rooms. 194
ICMP (Internet Control These are simply packets that contain error No specific port
Message Protocol) messages, informational messages, and 
control messages.
Each of these protocols will be explained in more detail, as needed, in later chapters of this book. You
should also note that this list is not complete, as there are dozens of other protocols; but these are the
basic protocols we will be discussing in this book. All of these protocols are part of a suite of protocols
referred to as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). But no matter the particular
protocol being used, all communication on networks takes place via packets, and those packets are
transmitted according to certain protocols, depending on the type of communication that is occurring.

CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet28
Ports
You may be wondering what a port is, especially since we’ve already talked about the ports that are the
connection locations on the back of your computer, such as a serial port, a parallel port, or RJ-45 and
RJ-11 ports. A port, in networking terms, is a handle—a connection point. It is a numeric designation
for a particular pathway of communications. All network communication, regardless of the port used,
comes into your computer via the connection on your NIC. 
So, the picture we’ve drawn of networks, to this point, is one of machines connected to each other via
cables, and perhaps to hubs, switches, or routers. These networks transmit binary information in
packets using certain protocols and ports.
How the Internet Works
Now that you have a basic idea of how computers communicate with each other over a network, it is
time to discuss how the Internet works. The Internet is essentially a large number of networks that are
connected to each other. Therefore, the Internet works exactly the same way as your local network. It
sends the same sort of data packets, using the same protocols. These various networks are simply
connected into main transmission lines called backbones. The points where the backbones connect to
each other are called network access points (NAPs). When you log on to the Internet, you probably use
an Internet service provider (ISP). That ISP has a connection either to the Internet backbone or to yet
another provider that has a backbone. So, logging on to the Internet is a process of connecting your
computer to your ISP’s network, which is, in turn, connected to one of the backbones on the Internet. 
IP Addresses
With tens of thousands of networks and millions of individual computers communicating and sending
data, a predictable problem arises. That problem is ensuring that the data packets go to the correct
computer. This task is accomplished in much the same way as traditional “snail” letter mail is delivered
to the right person: via an address. With network communications, this address is a special one,
referred to as an “IP” address. An IP address can be IP version 4 or version 6.
IPv4
An IP address is a series of four values, separated by periods. (An example would be 107.22.98.198.)
Each of the three-digit numbers must be between 0 and 255; thus an address of 107.22.98.466 would
not be a valid one. These addresses are actually four binary numbers; you just see them in decimal
format. Since each of these numbers is really just a decimal representation of 8 bits, they are often
referred to as octets. So there are four octets in an IP v4 address. Recall that a byte is 8 bits (1s and 0s),
and an 8-bit binary number converted to decimal format will be between 0 and 255. So you don’t have
to do the math yourself, I will tell you that this rule means there are a total of over 4.2 billion possible
IP addresses. You should not be concerned, however, that we will run out of new IP addresses soon.
There are methods already in place (which are discussed below) to extend the use of addresses.
ptg999
How the Internet Works 29
FYI: Converting Binary Numbers
For those readers not familiar with converting decimal to binary, there are several methods, one of
which is shown below. You should be aware that the computer will do this for you in the case of IP
addresses, but here’s one way—and perhaps the simplest—this is done: 
Divide repeatedly by 2, using “remainders” rather than decimal places, until you get down to 1. For
example, convert decimal 31 to binary:
31/2 = 15 Remainder 1
15/2 = 7 Remainder 1
7/2 = 3 Remainder 1
3/2 = 1 Remainder 1
1/2 = 0 Remainder 1
Now read the remainders from bottom to top: The binary equivalent is 11111.
The IP addresses come in two groups: public and private. The public IP addresses are for computers
connected to the Internet. No two public IP address can be the same. However, a private IP address,
such as one on a private company network, only has to be unique in that network. It does not matter if
other computers in the world have the same IP address, because this computer is never connected to
those other worldwide computers. Often network administrators use private IP addresses that begin
with a 10, such as 10.102.230.17. 
It should also be pointed out that often an ISP will buy a pool of public IP addresses and assign them
to you when you log on. An ISP might own 1,000 public IP address and have 10,000 customers.
Because all 10,000 customers will not be online at the same time, the ISP simply assigns an IP address
to a customer when he logs on, and the ISP un-assigns the IP address when the customer logs off.
The address of a computer tells you a lot about that computer. The first byte (or the first decimal
number) in an address tells you to what class of network that machine belongs. Table.2.4 summarizes
the five network classes.
TABLE 2.4 Network Classes
Class IP Range for the First Byte Use
A 0–126 Extremely large networks. No Class A network IP
addresses are left. All have been used.
B 128–191 Large corporate and government networks. All
Class B IP addresses have been used.
C 192–223 The most common group of IP addresses. Your
ISP probably has a Class C address.
D 224–247 These are reserved for multicasting (transmitting
different data on the same channel).
E 248–255 Reserved for experimental use.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet30
These five classes of networks will become more important later in this book (or should you decide to
study networking on a deeper level). Observe Table 2.4 carefully, and you probably will discover that the
IP range of 127 was not listed. This omission is because that range is reserved for testing. The IP address
of 127.0.0.1 designates the machine you are on, regardless of that machine’s assigned IP address. This
address is often referred to as the loopback address. That address will be used often in testing your machine
and your NIC. We will examine its use a bit later in this chapter, in the section on network utilities.
These particular classes are important as they tell you what part of the address represents the network
and what part represents the node. For example, in a Class A address, the first octet represents the
network, the remaining three represent the node. In a Class B address, the first two octets represent the
network and the second two represent the node. And finally, in a Class C address, the first three octets
represent the network, the last represents the node.
There are also some very specific IP addresses and IP address ranges you should be aware of. The first,
as previously mentioned, is 127.0.0.1, or the loopback address. It is another way of referring to the
network interface card of the machine you are on. 
Private IP addresses are another issue to be aware of. Certain ranges of IP addresses have been desig-
nated for use within networks. These cannot be used as public IP addresses, but can be used for internal
workstations and servers. Those IP addresses are:
■ 10.0.0.10 to 10.255.255.255
■ 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
■ 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
Subnetting and CIDR
We have already discussed IP version 4 network addresses; now let’s turn our attention to subnetting.
If you are already familiar with this topic, feel free to skip this section. For some reason this topic tends
to give networking students a great deal of trouble. So we will begin with a conceptual understanding.
Subnetting is simply chopping up a network in to smaller portions. For example, if you have a network
using the IP address 192.168.1.X (x being whatever the address is for the specific computer), then you
have allocated 255 possible IP addresses. What if you want to divide that into two separate sub
networks? Subnetting is how you do that.
More technically, the subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is assigned to each host to divide the 32-bit
binary IP address into network and node portions. You also cannot just put in any number you want.
The first value of a subnet mask must be 255; the remaining three values can be 255, 254, 252, 248,
240, or 224. Your computer will take your network IP address and the subnet mask and use a binary
AND operation to combine them. 
It may surprise you to know that you already have a subnet mask even if you have not been subnetting! If
you have a Class C IP address, then your network subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. If you have a Class B IP
address, then your subnet mask is 255.255.0.0. And finally, if it is Class A, your subnet mask is 255.0.0.0. 
ptg999
How the Internet Works 31
Now think about these numbers in relationship to binary numbers. The decimal value 255 converts to
11111111 in binary. So you are literally “masking” the portion of the network address that is used to
define the network, and the remaining portion is used to define individual nodes. Now if you want fewer
than 255 nodes in your subnet, then you need something like 255.255.255.240 for your subnet. If you
convert 240 to binary, it is 11110000. That means the first three octets and the first 4 bits of the last octet
define the network. The last 4 bits of the last octet define the node. That means you could have as many
as 1111 (in binary) or 15 (in decimal) nodes on this subnetwork. This is the basic essence of subnetting. 
CIDR
Subnetting only allows you to use certain, limited subnets. Another approach is CIDR, or classless
interdomain routing. Rather than define a subnet mask, you have the IP address followed by a slash and
a number. That number can be any number between 0 and 32, which results in IP addresses like these:
192.168.1.10/24 (basically a Class C IP address)
192.168.1.10/31 (much like a Class C IP address with a subnet mask)
When you use this, rather than having classes with subnets, you have variable-length subnet masking
(VLSM) that provides classless IP address. This is the most common way to define network IP
addresses today.
IPv6
You have probably heard talk of IP version 6, or IPv6, as an extension of IPv4. Essentially, IP version
4 is limited to 4.2 billion IP addresses. Even with the use of private IP addresses, we will run out of
available IP addresses. Think of all the computers, printers, routers, servers, smart phones, tablets, etc.,
all connected to the Internet. IP version 6 was designed to alleviate this problem. And if you looked
around in the network settings described in the last section, you probably saw the option to enable
IPv6. IPv6 utilizes a 128-bit address (instead of 32), so there is no chance of running out of IP
addresses in the foreseeable future. IPv6 also utilizes a hex numbering method in order to avoid long
addresses such as 132.64.34.26.64.156.143.57.1.3.7.44.122.111.201.5. The hex address format will
appear in the form of 3FFE:B00:800:2::C, for example. 
There is no subnetting in IPv6. Instead, it only uses CIDR. Network portion is indicated by a slash
followed by the number of bits in the address that are assigned to the network portion, such as 
/48
/64
There is a loopback address for IPv6, and it can be written as ::/128. Other differences between IPv4
and IPv6 are described here:
■ Link/machine-local.
IPv6 version of IPv4’s APIPA or Automatic Private IP Addressing. So if the machine is
configured for dynamically assigned addresses, and cannot communicate with a DHCP server,
it assigns itself a generic IP address. DHCP or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is used to
dynamically assign IP addresses within a network.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet32
IPV6 link/machine-local IP addresses all start with fe80::. So if your computer has this address,
that means it could not get to a DHCP server and therefore made up its own generic IP address. 
■ Site/network-local. 
IPv6 version of IPv4 private address. In other words these are real IP addresses, but only work
on this local network. They are not routable on the Internet.
All site/network-local IP addresses begin with FE and have C to F for the third hexadecimal
digit: FEC, FED, FEE, or FEF.
■ DHCPv6 uses the Managed Address Configuration Flag (M flag).
When set to 1, device should use DHCPV6 to obtain a stateful IPv6 address.
■ Other stateful configuration flag (O flag).
When set to 1, device should use DHCPv6 to obtain other TCP/IP configuration settings. In
other words, it should use the DHCP server to set things like the IP address of the gateway and
DNS servers.
■ M flag 
This indicates that the machine should use DHCPv6 to retrieve an IP address.
This is the essence of IPv6. You still have all the same utilities you used with IPv4. However, there is a
number 6 after the ping or traceroute, so if your computer has IPv6 enabled, you can use the
following:
ping6 www.yahoo.com
We will be discussing ping, traceroute, and other commands later in this chapter.
Uniform Resource Locators
After you connect to your ISP, you will, of course, want to visit some websites. You probably type
names, rather than IP addresses, into your browser’s address bar. For example, you might type in
www.chuckeasttom.com to go to my website. Your computer, or your ISP, must translate the name you
typed in (called a uniform resource locator [URL]) into an IP address. The DNS protocol, mentioned
in Table 2.3, handles this translation process. So you are typing in a name that makes sense to humans,
but your computer is using a corresponding IP address to connect. If that address is found, your
browser sends a packet (using the HTTP protocol) to port 80. If that target computer has software that
listens and responds to such requests (like web server software such as Apache or Microsoft Internet
Information Server), then the target computer will respond to your browser’s request and communi-
cation will be established. This method is how web pages are viewed. 
If you have ever received an Error 404: File Not Found, what you are seeing is that your browser
received back a packet (from the web server) with error code 404, denoting that the page you requested
could not be found. There are a series of error messages that the web server can send back to your web
ptg999
History of the Internet 33
browser, indicating different situations. Many of these problems the browser handles itself, and you
never see the error message. All error messages in the 400 series are client errors. This term means
something is wrong on your side, not the web server. Messages in the 500 series are server errors,
which means there is a problem on the web server. The 100 series messages are simply informational;
200 series messages indicate success (you usually do not see these, the browser simply processes
them); and 300 series messages are redirectional, meaning the page you are seeking has moved and
your browser is then directed to the new location.
Email works the same way as visiting websites. Your email client will seek out the address of your
email server. Then your email client will use either the POP3 protocol to retrieve your incoming email
or the SMTP protocol to send your outgoing email. Your email server (probably at your ISP or your
company) will then try to resolve the address you are sending to. If you send something to
chuck@chuckeasttom.com, your email server will translate that email address into an IP address for
the email server at yahoo.com, and your server will send your email there. Note that there are newer
email protocols available, but POP3 is still the most commonly used.
Many readers are probably familiar with chat rooms. A chat room, like the other methods of communi-
cation we have discussed, works with packets. You first find the address of the chat room; then you
connect. The difference here is that your computer’s chat software is constantly sending packets back
and forth, unlike email, which only sends and receives when you tell it to (or on a predetermined time
interval).
Remember that a packet has a header section and that header section contains your IP address and the
destination IP address that you are going to (as well as other information). This packet structure will
become important as we proceed through this book.
History of the Internet
At this point, you should have a basic understanding of how networks and the Internet work, as well as
some familiarity with IP addresses, protocols, and packets. It is also helpful to know the history of the
Internet, as many find that this overview helps put all of the material learned thus far into historical
perspective.
The Internet traces its roots to the Cold War. One positive thing that can be said about the Cold War is
that it was a time of significant investment in science and technology. In 1957, after the Soviet Union
launched the Sputnik satellite, the U.S. government formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) within the Defense Department. ARPA’s sole purpose was to fund and facilitate research into
technology. Obviously, this aim would include weapons technology, but the total focus would also
include communications technology.
In 1962, a study by the Rand Corporation proposed devising a communication method wherein data
was sent in packets between locations. If a packet was lost, the originator of the message would auto-
matically resend the message. This idea was a precursor to the Internet communication methodologies
that would eventually arise.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet34
In 1968, ARPA commissioned the construction of ARPANET, a simple Internet web of four points
(called nodes): UCLA, Stanford, UC Berkley, and the University of Utah. Although no one knew it at
the time, this small web was the birth of what would become the Internet. At this point, ARPANET had
only these four nodes connected.
The year 1972 was a milestone for the development of the Internet, in more than one sense. That year
ARPA was renamed DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Also that year, Ray
Tomlinson invented the first email program. At this point, four years after the birth of ARPANET, there
were 23 hosts on the network. (A host is a machine with data on it, to which you can connect; for
example, a web server is a host.) 
The following year, 1973, would mark the birth of the TCP/IP protocol, which allowed the various
computers to communicate in a uniform fashion, regardless of their hardware or operating system.
In 1974, Vince Cerf published a paper on the TCP protocol, and for the first time in computer history,
used the term Internet. In 1976, Ethernet cable was developed (the same cabling we use today), and
DARPA began to require the use of TCP/IP protocol on its network. This year also marked the
beginning of widespread distribution of the UNIX operating system. The development of UNIX and
the Internet would go hand in hand for many years to come. By this time, 8 years after the birth of
ARPANET, there were 111 hosts on the network.
In 1979, a major development occurred: the birth of Usenet newsgroups. These groups are essentially
bulletin boards open to the entire world. (Today you can access these groups via newsgroup reader
software, or via the Web by navigating to www.google.com and selecting Groups. There are thousands
of newsgroups devoted to every topic imaginable.) Just 2 years later, the National Science Foundation
(NSF) created CSNET for universities and research centers that were not part of ARPANET. That same
year, Cerf proposed connecting CSNET and ARPANET. By1981, the University of Wisconsin had
created DNS (Domain Name System) so that people could find nodes on the network via a name rather
than the actual IP address. At this point (1981), there were 562 hosts on the network.
The early 1980s saw enormous growth in the early Internet. DARPA divided its ARPANET into
military and nonmilitary segments, thus allowing more people to use the nonmilitary segment. And the
NSF introduced the T1 line (a very fast connection). In 1986, the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) was formed to oversee the creation of standards for the Internet and Internet protocols. By this
time, the Internet consisted of 2,308 hosts.
A pivotal year for Internet development turned out to be1990. That year, Tim Berners-Lee, working at
CERN laboratories in Europe, developed the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and gave the world its
very first web pages. Via the http protocol and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), people could
publish ideas on the Internet for anyone (with a connection) to view. By 1990, there were over 300,000
hosts on the Internet. (Fast-forward to 2004; Tim Berners-Lee receives the first Millennium Prize for
contributions to technology. He is widely regarded as the father of the World Wide Web [WWW].)
Internet growth and activity exploded in the 1990s. In 1992, CERN released the invention of web pages to
the world at large. In 1993, the first graphical web browser, named Mosaic, was invented. By 1994, Pizza
Hut began taking orders via web pages. The Internet has continued to grow; today, there are millions of
ptg999
Basic Network Utilities 35
websites around the world. Every organization has a site, from university departments, government
agencies, corporations, schools, religions, to nearly any group you can imagine. And many individuals
have personal websites, as well. Lots of you will use the Web for banking, shopping, information, and
entertainment. Additionally, you likely use email on a daily basis. (By the way, I primarily use email for
communication, so that is the best way to contact me if you wish: chuck@chuckeasttom.com.) The
Internet has become a virtual “living level” of interaction in our society. What company does not have a
website? What movie release does not have a website? What political candidate does not have a website?
In just over three decades, the Internet has become an integral part of our society.
Basic Network Utilities
Later in this book, you will use information and techniques that are based, in part, on certain tech-
niques anyone can perform on her own machine. There are network utilities that you can execute from
a command prompt (Windows) or from a shell (UNIX/Linux). Many readers are already familiar with
Windows, so the text’s discussion will execute the commands and discuss them from the Windows
command prompt perspective. However, it must be stressed that these utilities are available in all oper-
ating systems. In this section, you will read about IPConfig, ping, and tracert utilities.
IPConfig
The first step in studying networks is get information about your own system. To accomplish this fact-
finding mission, you will need to get to a command prompt. In Windows XP, go to the Start menu,
select All Programs (in Windows Vista or 7), then choose Accessories. You will then see an option
called Command Prompt. (For Windows 2000 users, the process is identical, except the first option is
simply called Programs rather than All Programs.) Next, type in ipconfig. (You could input the same
command in UNIX or Linux by typing in ifconfig once inside the shell.) After typing ipconfig and
pressing the Enter key, you should see something much like what is shown in Figure 2.1.
FIGURE 2.1 IPConfig.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet36
This command gives you some information about your connection to a network (or to the Internet).
Most importantly, you find out your own IP address. The command also has the IP address for your
default gateway, which is your connection to the outside world. Running the IPConfig command is a
first step in determining your system’s network configuration. Most commands that this book will
mention, including IPConfig, have a number of parameters, or flags, that can be passed to the
commands to make the computer behave in a certain way. You can find out what these commands are
by typing in the command, followed by a space, and then typing in hyphen question mark, -?. Figure
2.2 shows the results of this method for the IPConfig command.
FIGURE 2.2 IPConfig help.
As you can see in Figure 2.2, there a number of options you might use to find out different details about
your computer’s configuration. The most commonly used method would probably be the
IPConfig/all, shown in Figure 2.3. You can see that this option gives you much more information.
For example, IPConfig/all gives the name of your computer, when your computer obtained its IP
address, and more.
Ping
Another commonly used command is ping. ping is used to send a test packet, or echo packet, to a
machine to find out if the machine is reachable and how long the packet takes to reach the machine.
This useful diagnostic tool can be employed in elementary hacking techniques. In Figure 2.4 you see a
ping command executed on www.yahoo.com.
ptg999
Basic Network Utilities 37
FIGURE 2.3 IPConfig/all.
FIGURE 2.4 Ping.
ptg999
CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet38
This figure tells you that a 32-byte echo packet was sent to the destination and returned. The TTL item
(Time To Live) shows how many intermediary steps, or hops, the packet should take to the destination
before giving up. Remember that the Internet is a vast conglomerate of interconnected networks. Your
packet probably won’t go straight to its destination; it will take several hops to get there. As with
IPConfig, you can type in ping -? to find out various ways you can refine your ping.
Tracert
The final command we will examine in this chapter is the tracert command. This command is a more
or less “ping deluxe.” tracert not only tells you if the packet got to its destination and how long it
took, but also it tells you all the intermediate hops it took to get there. This utility will prove very useful
to you later in this book. Figure 2.5 illustrates a tracert to www.yahoo.com. (This same command can
be executed in Linux or UNIX, but there it is called traceroute rather than tracert.)
FIGURE 2.5 Tracert.
With tracert, you can see (in milliseconds) the IP addresses of each intermediate step listed and how
long it took to get to that step. Knowing the steps required to reach a destination can be very important,
as you will find later in this book.
Certainly there are other utilities that can be of use to you when working with network communications.
However, the three we just examined are the core utilities. These three (IPConfig, ping, and tracert)
are absolutely essential to any network administrator, and you should commit them to memory.
ptg999
Advanced Network Communications Topics 39
Other Network Devices
There are other devices involved in networking that work to protect your computer from the outside
world, some of which were briefly mentioned in Chapter 1. Now we will review a couple of them in a
bit more detail. The two most common are the firewall and the proxy server. A firewall is essentially a
barrier between your network and the rest of the Internet. A personal computer (PC) can be used as a
firewall; in many cases, a special router can function as a firewall. Firewalls use different techniques to
protect your network, but the most common strategy is packet filtering. In a packet-filtering firewall,
each incoming packet is examined. Only those packets that match the criteria you set are allowed
through. (Commonly, only packets using certain types of protocols are allowed through.) Many oper-
ating systems, such as Windows (all versions since XP), and many Linux distributions, include basic
packet-filtering software with the operating system.
The second very common type of defensive device is a proxy server. A proxy server will almost always
be another computer. You might see the same machine used as both a proxy server and a firewall. A
proxy server’s purpose is quite simple: it hides your entire network from the outside world. People
trying to investigate your network from the outside will see only the proxy server. They will not see the
actual machines on your network. When packets go out of your network, their headers are changed so
that the packets have the return address of the proxy server. Conversely, the only way you can access
the outside world is via the proxy server. A proxy server combined with a firewall is basic network
security. It would frankly be negligent to ever run a network that did not have a firewall and proxy
server. In a later chapter, we will examine firewalls in more detail.
Advanced Network Communications Topics
These subjects are not absolutely required for you to understand this book, but they will give you a
broader understanding of networks in general. If you have any intention of delving into network
security on a professional level, then you will need this information—and much more.
The OSI Model
Let’s begin with the OSI model, or Open Systems Interconnection model. This model is a description
of how networks communicate. It describes the various protocols and activities, and it tells how the
protocols and activities relate to each other. This model is divided into seven layers, as shown in Table
2.5, and was originally developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in the 1980s. 
TABLE 2.5 The OSI Model

application and performs common 
application services for the application 
processes.

CHAPTER 2 Networks and the Internet40
6 Presentation The presentation layer relieves the 
application layer of concern regarding 
syntactical differences in data  
representation within the end-user systems.
5 Session The session layer provides the mechanism NetBIOS
for managing the dialogue between end-user 
application processes.
4 Transport This layer provides end-to-end TCP, UDP
communication control.
3 Network This layer routes the information IP, Address Resolution 
in the network. Protocol, Internet Control 
Message Protocol
2 Data Link This layer describes the logical organization Serial Line Internet 
of data bits transmitted on a particular medium. Protocol, Point-to-Point 
Data link is divided into two sublayers: the Protocol
Media Access Control layer (MAC) and the 
Logical Link Control layer (LLC).
1 Physical This layer describes the physical properties of the None
various communications media, as well as the 
electrical properties and interpretation of the 
exchanged signals. In other words, the physical 
layer is the actual NIC, Ethernet cable, and so forth. 
This layer is where bits are translated into voltages, 
and vice versa.
Many networking students memorize this model. It’s good to at least memorize the names of the seven
layers and to understand basically what they each do. From a security perspective, the more you under-
stand about network communications, the more sophisticated your defense can be. The most important
thing for you to understand is that this model describes a hierarchy of communication. One layer will
only communicate with the layer directly above it, or below it.
Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses
MAC addresses are unique addresses for an NIC. (MAC is also a sublayer of the data link layer of the
OSI model.) Every NIC in the world has a unique address that is represented by a 6-byte hexadecimal
number, and an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to convert IP addresses to MAC addresses.
When you type in a web address, the DNS protocol is used to translate that into an IP address; then the
ARP protocol will translate that IP address into a specific MAC address of an individual NIC.
This brings us to how DNS is accomplished; or rather, how does a URL get translated into an IP address?
How does the computer know what IP goes with what URL? There are servers set up just to do this task,
called DNS servers. If you are on a corporate network, you probably have a DNS server on your network.
If not, then your ISP has one. These servers maintain a table of IP-to-URL entries. From time to time there
are transfers of DNS data, called zone transfers, that allow one DNS server to send its changes to another.
Across the Internet, there are root DNS servers that are maintained with centralized data for all registered
URL/IP addresses.

Summary
This chapter cannot make you a networking expert. However, you should now have a basic under-
standing of how networks and the Internet work. Before you move on to subsequent chapters, you
should make certain you completely understand basic hardware like switches, NICs, routers, and hubs.
You should also be familiar with the basic protocols presented in this chapter. It is important that you
be comfortable with the utilities presented. It is strongly suggested that you experiment with these util-
ities extensively. It is also important that you be comfortable with the basics of the OSI model. Many
students struggle with it at first, but at least make sure you have a general understanding of it before
you move on to Chapter 3, “Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse.”
This material will be critical in later chapters. If you are new to this material, you should thoroughly
study this chapter before continuing. In the exercises at the end of this chapter, you will be able to
practice using IPConfig, tracert, and ping.

Introduction
In every new frontier, a criminal element is bound to emerge. In times past, the high seas gave rise to
pirates, and America’s wild west produced gangs of outlaws. The Internet is no different than any other
frontier; it has its share of outlaws. Besides hacking and virus creation, both mentioned in Chapter 1,
“Introduction to Computer Security,” there are other dangers. Fraud is one of the most common
dangers of the Internet. As more people utilize the Internet as a conduit for commerce, there arises a
greater opportunity for fraud. Fraud has been a part of life for as long as civilization has existed; in past
centuries “snake oil” salesmen roamed the country selling face cures and elixirs. The Internet makes
such fraud even easier. In fact, many experts would consider fraud to be the most prevalent danger on
the Internet. There are multiple reasons for the popularity of Internet fraud among con artists. First,
committing an Internet fraud does not require the technical expertise that hacking and virus creation
require. Second, there are a great number of people engaging in various forms of online commerce, and
this large amount of business creates a great many opportunities for fraud.

How Internet Fraud Works 49
There are many avenues for fraud on the Internet. In this chapter, we will explore what the various
major types of fraud are, what the law says, and what you can do to protect yourself. Fortunately for
some readers, this particular chapter is not particularly technical, because most Internet fraud does not
rely on in-depth technological expertise. Internet fraud merely uses the computer as a venue for many
of the same fraud schemes that have been perpetrated throughout history.
How Internet Fraud Works
There are a variety of ways that a fraud can be perpetrated via the Internet. The Securities and
Exchange Commission lists several types of Internet fraud on their website;1 we will briefly discuss
each of those and others, but it is not possible for us to cover every variation of each fraud scheme that
has been used on the Internet. Such an undertaking would not only fill an entire book, but also possibly
several volumes. What we can do is to cover the more common scams, and try to extrapolate some
general principles that you can apply to any potential fraud. If you use these specific cases to extrap-
olate some general principles, then you should be prepared to avoid most fraud schemes.
Investment Offers
Investment offers are nothing new. Even some legitimate stockbrokers make their living by cold
calling, the process of simply calling people (perhaps from the phone book), and trying to get them to
invest in a specific stock. This practice is employed by some legitimate firms, but it is also a favorite
con game for perpetrators of fraud. The Internet has allowed investment offers—both genuine and
fraudulent—to be more easily disseminated to the general public. Most readers are probably familiar
with investment offers flooding their inbox on a daily basis. Some of these email notifications entice
you to become directly involved with a particular investment plan; other emails offer seemingly
unbiased information from investors, free of charge. (Unfortunately, much of this advice is not as
unbiased as it might appear to be.) While legitimate online newsletters can help investors gather
valuable information, keep in mind that some online newsletters are fraudulent.
Common Schemes
One of the more common schemes involves sending out an email that suggests that you can make an
outrageous sum of money with a very minimal investment. Perhaps the most famous of these schemes
has been the Nigerian fraud. In this scenario, an email is sent to a number of random email addresses.
Each one contains a message purporting to be from a relative of some deceased Nigerian doctor or
government official. The deceased person will be someone you would associate with significant social
standing, thus increasing the likelihood that you would view the offer more favorably. The offer goes
like this: A person has a sum of money he wishes to transfer out of his country, and for security
reasons, he cannot use normal channels. He wishes to use your bank account to “park” the funds
temporarily. If you will allow him access to your account, you will receive a hefty fee. If you do agree
to this arrangement, you will receive, via normal mail, a variety of very official-looking documents,
enough to convince most casual observers that the arrangement is legitimate. You will then be asked to
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse50
advance some money to cover items such as taxes and wire fees. Should you actually send any money,
you will have lost the money you advanced and you will never hear from these individuals again. The
U.S. Secret Service has a bulletin issued detailing this particular fraud scheme.2
Now consider this investment scam, and variations of it, from a logical point of view. If you had large
sums of money you needed to transfer, would you send it to a person in a foreign country, someone you
had never met? Wouldn’t you be worried that the recipient would cash out her account and take the
next plane to Rio? If a person needs to transfer money internationally, why doesn’t he just transfer the
money to an account in the Bahamas? Or cash out the account and send it via Federal Express or
United Parcel Service to a storage facility in the United States? The point is that there are many ways a
person could get money out of a country without trusting some stranger he has never seen before. That
fact alone should indicate to you that this offer is simply not legitimate. This concept is the first general
principle you should derive concerning fraud. In any offer, consider the point of view of the person
offering it. Does it sound as if he is taking an inordinately large risk? Does the deal seem oddly biased
in your favor? Put yourself in his position. Would you engage in the deal if you where in his position?
If not, then this factor is a sign that the deal might not be what it seems.
Investment Advice
Such blatant fraud schemes are not the only investment pitfall on the Internet. Some companies pay the
people who write online newsletters to recommend their stocks. While this activity isn’t actually
illegal, U.S. federal securities laws do require the newsletters to disclose that they where paid to proffer
this advice. Such laws are in place because when the writers are recommending any product, their
opinion might be swayed by the fact that compensation is being provided to them for that opinion.
Many online investment newsletters do not disclose that they are actually being paid to recommend
certain stocks. This situation means that the “unbiased” stock advice you are getting could actually be
quite biased. Rather than getting the advice of an unbiased expert, you may be getting a paid adver-
tisement. This pitfall is one of the most common traps of online investment advice, more common than
the blatant frauds.
Sometimes these online stock bulletins can be part of a wider scheme, often called a pump and dump.
A classic pump and dump is rather simple. The con artist takes a stock that is virtually worthless and
purchases large amounts of the stock. The con artist then artificially inflates the value,3 in several ways.
One common method is to begin circulating rumors on various Internet bulletin boards and chat rooms
that the stock is about to go up significantly. Often it is suggested by the trickster that the company has
some new innovative product due to come out in the next few weeks. Another method is to simply push
the stock on as many people as possible. The more people vying to buy a stock, the higher its price will
rise. If both methods are combined, it is possible to take a worthless stock and temporarily double or
triple its value. The perpetrator of the fraud has already purchased volumes of the stock, at a very low
price, before executing this scheme. When the stock goes as high as she thinks it can, she then dumps
her stock and takes the money. In a short time, and certainly by the time the company’s next quarterly
earnings report is released, the stock returns to its real value. This sort of scheme has been very popular
in the past several decades; thus, you should always be wary of such “insider” information. If a person
ptg999
How Internet Fraud Works 51
is aware that Company X is about to release an innovative new product that will drive her stock value
up, why would she share that information with total strangers? 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lists several tips for avoiding such scams:4
1. Consider the source. Especially if you are not well versed in the market, make sure you accept
advice only from well-known and reputable stock analysts.
2. Independently verify claims. Do not simply accept someone else’s word about anything.
3. Research. Read up on the company, the claims about the company, its stock history, and so
forth.
4. Beware of high-pressure tactics. Legitimate stock traders do not pressure customers into
buying. They help customers pick stocks that customers want. If you are being pressured, that is
an indication of potential problems.
5. Be skeptical. A healthy dose of skepticism can save you a lot of money. Or, as the saying goes,
“If it’s too good to be true, it probably isn’t.”
6. Make sure you thoroughly research any investment opportunity.
The truth is that these types of fraud depend on the greed of the victim. It is not my intent to blame
victims of fraud, but it is important to realize that if you allow avarice to do your thinking for you, you
are a prime candidate to be a victim of fraud. Your 401K or IRA may not earn you exorbitant wealth
overnight, but they are steady and relatively safe. (No investment is completely safe.) If you are
seeking ways to make large sums of money with minimal time and effort, then you are an ideal target
for perpetrators of fraud.
In Practice
Practically speaking, the recommended way to handle online investments is to only participate in
them if you initiated the discussion with a reputable broker. This would mean you would never
respond to or participate in any investment offer that was sent to you via email, online ads etc. You
would only participate in investments that you initiated with well-known brokers. Usually such
brokers are traditional investment firms with long-standing reputations that now simply offer their
services online. It is also important to check out any broker with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC).
Auction Frauds
Online auctions, such as eBay, can be a wonderful way to find merchandise at very good prices. I
routinely use such auctions to purchase goods. However, any auction site can be fraught with peril.
Will you actually get the merchandise you ordered? Will it be “as advertised”? Most online auctions
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse52
are legitimate, and most auction websites take precautions to limit fraud on their website. But problems
still occur. In fact, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission5 (FTC) lists the following four categories of
online auction fraud:
■ Failure to send the merchandise
■ Sending something of lesser value than advertised
■ Failure to deliver in a timely manner
■ Failure to disclose all relevant information about a product or terms of the sale
The first category, failure to deliver the merchandise, is the most clear-cut case of fraud and is fairly
simple. Once you have paid for an item, no item arrives. The seller simply keeps your money. In
organized fraud, the seller will simultaneously advertise several items for sale, collect money on all the
auctions, and then disappear. If he or she has planned this well, the entire process was done with a fake
identification, using a rented mailbox and anonymous email service. The person then walks away with
the proceeds of the scam. 
The second category of fraud, delivering an item of lesser value than the one advertised, can become a
gray area. In some cases, it is outright fraud. The seller advertises something about the product that
simply is not true. For example, the seller might advertise a signed copy of the first printing of a
famous author’s book, but then instead ship you a fourth printing with either no autograph, or one that
is unverified. However, in other cases of this type of problem, it can simply be that the seller is
overzealous, or frankly mistaken. The seller might claim his baseball was signed by a famous athlete,
but not be aware himself that the autograph is a fraud. 
This problem is closely related to the fourth item on the FTC list, failure to disclose all relevant facts
about the item. For example, a book might be an authentic first printing and autographed, but be in
such poor physical condition as to render it worthless. This fact may or may not be mentioned in
advance by the seller. Failure to be forthcoming with all the relevant facts about a particular item might
be the result of outright fraud or simply of the seller’s ignorance. The FTC also lists failure to deliver
the product on time as a form of fraud. It is unclear whether or not that is fraud in many cases, or
merely woefully inadequate customer service.
The Federal Trade Commission and Auction Fraud
The FTC also lists three other areas of bidding fraud that are growing in popularity on the Internet.
From the FTC website:5
■ Shill bidding, when fraudulent sellers (or their “shills”) bid on the seller’s items to drive up the
price.
■ Bid shielding, when fraudulent buyers submit very high bids to discourage other bidders from
competing for the same item. The fake buyers then retract their bids so that people they know
can get the item at a lower price. 
ptg999
Identity Theft 53
■ Bid siphoning, when con artists lure bidders off legitimate auction sites by offering to sell the
“same” item at a lower price. Their intent is to trick consumers into sending money without
proffering the item. By going off-site, buyers lose any protections the original site may provide,
such as insurance, feedback forms, or guarantees.
Shill Bidding
Shill bidding has been probably the most common of these three auction frauds. It is not very complex.
If the perpetrator is selling an item at an auction site, she will also create several fake identities. She
will use these fake identities to bid on the item and thus drive the price up. It is very difficult to detect
if such a scheme is in operation. However, a simple rule of thumb on auctions is to decide, before you
start bidding, what your maximum price is. And then, under no circumstances, do you exceed that
price, by even one penny.
Bid Shielding
While shill bidding may be difficult to combat, bid shielding can be addressed fairly easily by the
proprietors of the auction site. Many of the major auction sites, such as eBay, have taken steps to
prevent bid shielding. The most obvious is to revoke bidding privileges for bidders who back out after
they have won an auction. So if a person puts in a very high bid to keep others away, then at the last
moment retracts his bid, he might lose his ability to be on that auction site.
Bid Siphoning
Bid siphoning is a less-common practice. In this scheme, the perpetrator places a legitimate item up for
bid on an auction site. But then, in the ad for that item, she provides links to sites that are not part of the
auction site. The unwary buyer who follows those links might find himself on an alternative site that is
a “setup” to perpetrate some sort of fraud.
All of these tactics have a common aim: to subvert the normal auction process. The normal auction
process is an ideal blend of capitalism and democracy. Everyone has an equal chance to obtain the
product in question, if he or she is willing to outbid the other shoppers. The buyers themselves set the
price of the product, based on the value they perceive the product to have. In my opinion, auctions are
an excellent vehicle for commerce. However, unscrupulous individuals will always attempt to subvert
any process for their own goals.
Identity Theft
Identity theft is a growing problem and a very troubling one. The concept is rather simple, though the
process can be complex, and the consequences for the victim can be quite severe. The idea is simply for
one person to take on the identity of another. This is usually attempted to make purchases; but identity
theft can be done for other reasons, such as obtaining credit cards in the victim’s name, or even driver’s
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse54
licenses. If the perpetrator obtains a credit card in someone else’s name, then he can purchase products
and the victim of this fraud is left with debts she was not aware of and did not authorize. 
In the case of getting a driver’s license in the victim’s name, this fraud might be attempted to shield the
perpetrator from the consequences of his or her own poor driving record. For example, a person might
get your driving information to create a license with his or her own picture. Perhaps the criminal in this
case has a very bad driving record and even warrants out for immediate arrest. Should the person be
stopped by law enforcement officers, he or she can then show the fake license. When the police officer
checks the license, it is legitimate and has no outstanding warrants. However, the ticket the criminal
receives will be going on your driving record, because it is your information on the driver’s license. It
is also unlikely that the perpetrator of that fraud will actually pay the ticket, so at some point you—
whose identity was stolen—will receive notification that your license has been revoked for failure to
pay a ticket. Unless you can then prove, with witnesses, that you were not at the location the ticket was
given at the time it was given, you may have no recourse but to pay the ticket, in order to reestablish
your driving privileges.
The U.S. Department of Justice defines identity theft in this manner:6
“Identity theft and identity fraud are terms used to refer to all types of crime in which someone
wrongfully obtains and uses another person’s personal data in some way that involves fraud or
deception, typically for economic gain.”
The advent of the Internet has made the process of stealing a person’s identity even easier than it used
to be. Many states now have court records and motor vehicle records online. In some states, a person’s
social security number is used for the driver’s license number. So if a criminal gets a person’s social
security number, he or she can look up that person’s driving record, perhaps get a duplicate of the
person’s license, find out about any court records concerning that person, and on some websites, even
run the person’s credit history. Later in this book, we will examine using the Internet as an investigative
tool. Like any tool, it can be used for benign or malevolent purposes. The same tools you can use to do
a background check on a prospective employee can be used to find out enough information to forge
someone else’s identity.
FYI: Alternate Means of Identity Theft
There are other means for a perpetrator to conduct identity theft that do not involve the Internet. A
ring of criminals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex were working with waiters in restaurants.
When the waiter took your credit card or debit card to pay for the meal, they would also use a
small hand held device (kept hidden in a pocket) to scan in your credit card information. They
would then give this information to the identity theft ring, who could either make online purchases
or use that information to produce fake credit cards with your name and account data. This is a
new twist on identity theft. The only way to avoid this sort of danger is to never use your credit or
debit card unless it is going to be processed right there in front of you. Do not let someone take
your card out of your site to process it.
ptg999
Cyber Stalking 55
Phishing
One of the more common ways to accomplish identity theft is via a technique called phishing, which is
the process of trying to induce the target to provide you with personal information. For example the
attacker might send out an email purporting to be from a bank, and telling recipients that there is a
problem with their bank account. The email then directs them to click on a link to the bank website
where they can login and verify their account. However, the link really goes to a fake website set up by
the attacker. When the target goes to that website and enters his information, he will have just given his
username and password to the attacker.
Many end users today are aware of these sorts of tactics and avoid clicking on email links. But unfor-
tunately, not everyone is so prudent, and this attack still is effective. It is also the case that the attackers
have come up with new ways of phishing. One of these methods is called cross-site scripting. If a
website allows users to post content that other users can see (such as a product review) the attacker then
posts, but instead of posting a review or other legitimate content, they post a script (i.e., JavaScript or
something similar). Now when other users visit that web page, instead of loading a review or comment,
it will load the attacker’s script. That script may do any number of things, but it is common for the
script to redirect the end user to a phishing website. If the attacker is clever, the phishing website looks
identical to the real one, and end users are not aware they have been redirected. Cross-site scripting can
be prevented by web developers filtering all user input.
Cyber Stalking
Stalking in general has received a great deal of attention in the past few years. The primary reason is
that stalking has often been a prelude to violent acts, including sexual assault and homicide. For this
reason, many states have passed a variety of antistalking laws. However, stalking has expanded into
cyberspace. What is cyber stalking? It is using the Internet to harass another person; or, as the U.S.
Department of Justice7 puts it:
“Although there is no universally accepted definition of cyber stalking, the term is used in this
report to refer to the use of the Internet, e-mail, or other electronic communications devices to
stalk another person. Stalking generally involves harassing or threatening behavior that an
individual engages in repeatedly, such as following a person, appearing at a person’s home or
place of business, making harassing phone calls, leaving written messages or objects, or
vandalizing a person’s property. Most stalking laws require that the perpetrator make a
credible threat of violence against the victim; others include threats against the victim’s
immediate family; and still others require only that the alleged stalker’s course of conduct
constitute an implied threat. While some conduct involving annoying or menacing behavior
might fall short of illegal stalking, such behavior may be a prelude to stalking and violence
and should be treated seriously.”
If someone uses the Internet to harass, threaten, or intimidate another person, then the perpetrator is
guilty of cyber stalking. The most obvious example is sending threatening email. The guidelines on
what is considered “threatening” can vary a great deal from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. But a good rule
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse56
of thumb is that if the email’s content would be considered threatening in normal speech, then it will
probably be considered a threat if sent electronically. Other examples of cyber stalking are less clear. If
you request that someone quit emailing you, yet they continue to do so, is that a crime? Unfortunately,
there is no clear answer on that issue. The truth is that it may or may not be considered a crime,
depending on such factors as the content of the emails, the frequency, the prior relationship between
you and the sender, as well as your jurisdiction. 
Real Cyber Stalking Cases
The following three cases, also from the Department of Justice website,7 illustrate cases of cyber
stalking. Examining the facts in these cases might help you to get an idea of what legally constitutes
cyber stalking.
1. In the first successful prosecution under California’s new cyber stalking law, prosecutors in the
Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office obtained a guilty plea from a 50-year-old former secu-
rity guard who used the Internet to solicit the rape of a woman who rejected his romantic ad-
vances. The defendant terrorized his 28-year-old victim by impersonating her in various
Internet chat rooms and online bulletin boards, where he posted, along with her telephone num-
ber and address, messages that she fantasized being raped. On at least six occasions, sometimes
in the middle of the night, men knocked on the woman’s door saying they wanted to rape her.
The former security guard pleaded guilty in April 1999 to one count of stalking and three
counts of solicitation of sexual assault. He faces up to six years in prison. 
2. A local prosecutor’s office in Massachusetts charged a man who, using anonymous re-mailers,
allegedly engaged in a systematic pattern of harassment of a co-worker, which culminated in an
attempt to extort sexual favors from the victim under threat of disclosing past sexual activities
to the victim’s new husband. 
3. An honors graduate from the University of San Diego terrorized five female university students
over the Internet for more than a year. The victims received hundreds of violent and threatening
emails, sometimes receiving four or five messages a day. The graduate student, who has entered
a guilty plea and faces up to six years in prison, told police he committed the crimes because he
thought the women were laughing at him and causing others to ridicule him. In fact, the victims
had never met him.
Clearly, using the Internet to harass people is just as serious a crime as harassing them in person. This
problem has even extended to workplace issues. For example, court cases have upheld that unwanted
email pornography can be construed as sexual harassment. If an employee complains about unwanted
email, the employer has a duty to at least attempt to ameliorate the situation. This attempt can be as
simple as installing a very inexpensive spam blocker (software that tries to limit or eradicate unwanted
email). However, if the employer takes no steps whatsoever to correct the problem, that reticence may
be seen by a court as contributing to a hostile work environment. As previously stated, if the stalking
act would constitute as harassment in person, then it would be considered harassment in cyberspace.
Black’s Law Dictionary8 defines harassment as follows:
ptg999
Cyber Stalking 57
“A course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress in
such person and serves no legitimate purpose.”
“Words, gestures, and actions that tend to annoy, alarm, and abuse (verbally) another person.”
Usually law enforcement officials will need some credible threat of harm in order to pursue harassment
complaints. In simple terms, this situation means that if you are in an anonymous chat room and
someone utters some obscenity, that act probably will not be considered harassment. However, if you
receive specific threats via email, those threats would probably be considered harassment. 
Laws about Internet Fraud
Over the past several years, various legislatures (in the United States and in other countries) have
passed laws defining Internet fraud and stating the proscribed punishments. In many cases, existing
laws against fraud and harassment are applicable to the Internet as well; however, some legislators have
felt that cyber crime warranted its own distinct legislation.
Identity theft has been the subject of various state and federal laws. Most states now have laws against
identity theft.9 This crime is also covered by federal law. In 1998, the federal government passed 18
U.S.C. 1028, also known as The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998. This law made
identity theft a federal crime.10 Throughout the United States, federal law now covers identity theft, and
in many states identity theft is also covered by state law. 
Many states specifically prohibit cyber stalking; and in general, existing anti-stalking laws can be
applied to the Internet. In 2001, in California a man was convicted of cyber stalking under existing
antistalking statutes.11 Other countries also have existing antistalking laws that can be applied to cyber
stalking as well. Canada has had a comprehensive antistalking law since 1993. Unfortunately, there are
many similar cases. Just a few include the following:
■ From 2010, there is the case of Joseph Medico (70 years old), who met a 16-year-old girl at his
church. Mr. Medico followed the girl to her car and tried to talk her into going to dinner with
him and then back to his home. When she rejected his advances, he began calling and texting
her several times a day. His activities escalated until the girl reported the activities and Mr.
Medico was arrested for stalking.
■ In 2008 Shawn Michael Hutchinson, 20, posted threats and nude pictures of a former girlfriend.
His threats included statements such as ‘“I told you that if I saw you with David that would be
the end of you. That’s not a threat, it’s a promise.”
One nation that has decided to crack down hard on cyber criminals is Romania. Some experts have de-
scribed Romanian cyber crime law as the strictest in the world.12 However, what is most interesting about
Romanian law is how specific it is. The crafters of this legislation went to some effort to very specifically
define all the terms used in the legislation. This specificity is very important in order to avoid defendants
finding loopholes in laws. Unfortunately, the Romanian government only took such measures after media
sources around the world identified their country as a “Citadel for Cyber Crime.” The country’s reactive
approach to cyber crime is probably not the best solution.
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse58
The University of Dayton School of Law has an entire website devoted to cyber crime.13 The school has
some rather extensive links on cyber crime, cyber stalking, and other Internet-based crimes. As we
move forward in the twenty-first century, one can expect to see more law schools with courses dedi-
cated to cyber crime.
An interesting phenomenon has begun in the past few years: the emergence of attorneys who specialize
in cyber crime cases. The fact that there are lawyers who specialize in this area of law is a strong indi-
cator that Internet crime is becoming a growing problem in modern society.
Protecting Yourself against Cyber Crime
Now that you know about the various frauds that are prevalent on the Internet and have looked at the
relevant laws, you might be wondering what you can do to protect yourself. There are several specific
steps you can take to minimize the chances of being the victim of Internet crime. There are also some
clear guidelines on how you should handle the situation, should you become a victim. 
Protecting against Investment Fraud
To protect yourself against investment fraud, follow these guidelines:
1. Only invest with well-known, reputable brokers.
2. If it sounds too good to be true, then avoid it.
3. Ask yourself why this person is informing you of this great investment deal. Why would a
complete stranger decide to share some incredible investment opportunity with you?
4. Remember that even legitimate investment involves risk, so never invest money that you cannot
afford to lose.
Protecting against Identity Theft
When the issue is identity theft, your steps are clear:
1. Do not provide your personal information to anyone if it is not absolutely necessary. This rule
means that when communicating on the Internet with anyone you do not personally know, do
not reveal anything about yourself; not your age, occupation, real name, nothing.
2. Destroy documents that have personal information on them. If you simply throw away bank
statements and credit card bills, then someone rummaging through your trash can get a great
deal of personal data. You can obtain a paper shredder from an office supply store or many
retail department stores for less than $20. Shred these documents before disposing of them.
This rule may not seem like it is related to computer security, but information gathered through
nontechnical means can be used in conjunction with the Internet to perpetrate identity theft.
ptg999
Protecting Yourself against Cyber Crime 59
3. Check your credit frequently. Many websites, including www.consumerinfo.com, allow you to
check your credit and even get your beacon score for a nominal fee. I check my credit twice per
year. If you see any items you did not authorize, that is a clear indication that you might be a
victim of identity theft.
4. If your state has online driving records, then check yours once per year. If you see driving in-
fractions that you did not commit, this evidence is a clear sign that your identity is being used
by someone else. In an upcoming chapter on cyber detective work, we will explore in detail
how to obtain such records online, often for less than $5.
To summarize, the first step in preventing identity theft is restricting the amount of personal infor-
mation you make available. The next step is simply monitoring your credit and driving records so that
you will be aware if someone attempts to use your identity. 
Another part of protecting your identity is protecting your privacy in general. That task means
preventing others from gaining information about you that you don’t explicitly provide them. That
preventative method includes keeping websites from gathering information about you without your
knowledge. Many websites store information about you and your visit to their site in small files called
cookies. These cookie files are stored on your machine. The problem with cookies is that any website
can read any cookie on your machine, even ones that the website you are currently visiting did not
create. So if you visit one website and it stores items like your name, the site you visited, and the time
you where there, then another website could potentially read that cookie and know where you have
been on the Internet. One of the best ways to stop cookies you don’t want is anti-spyware software. We
will discuss such software in more detail in a later chapter. Right now, let’s see how to change your
Internet settings to help reduce exposures to your privacy.
Secure Browser Settings
If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can go to Tools and use the drop-down menu; then
select Options. You will then see a screen much like the one shown in Figure 3.1. You can then select
the third tab, labeled Privacy.
When you select that Privacy tab, you will see the screen shown in Figure 3.2. Notice the sliding bar on
the left that lets you select various levels of general protection against cookies. It is recommended that
you select Medium High as your level.
Note the Advanced button at the bottom of the screen. This button allows you to block or allow indi-
vidual websites from creating cookies on your computer’s hard drive. Altering cookie settings on your
machine is just one part of protecting your privacy, but it is an important part.
You probably also want to ensure that you have selected the In Private browsing option, also shown in
Figure 3.2.
If you are working with Firefox, the process is similar. You select Tools from the drop-down menu,
then select Options. You will then see the screen shown in Figure 3.3.

ptg999
Protecting Yourself against Cyber Crime 61
FIGURE 3.3 Firefox options.
Notice the Privacy option and you will see a screen much like the one shown in Figure 3.4.
FIGURE 3.4 Firefox privacy.
As you can see from Figure 3.4, there are a number of privacy settings for you to select, and they are
self-explanatory. You can also select the Security tab and see the screen in Figure 3.5.
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse62
FIGURE 3.5 Firefox security.
I recommend selecting High Security. Also, I would only allow first-party cookies. Third-party cookies
are notorious for behaving in ways that violate user privacy. We will discuss cookies and spyware in
much more detail in a later chapter, but the simple steps just examined can go a long way toward
helping to secure your privacy.
Dealing with auction fraud involves a different set of precautions; here are four good ideas.
1. Only use reputable auction sites. The most well-known site is eBay, but any widely known, rep-
utable site will be a safer gamble. Such auction sites tend to take precautions to prevent fraud
and abuse.
2. If it sounds too good to be true, don’t bid.
3. Some sites actually allow you to read feedback other buyers have provided on a given seller.
Read the feedback, and only work with reputable sellers.
4. When possible use a separate credit card, one with a low limit, for online auctions. That way,
should your credit card be compromised, your liability is limited. Using your debit card is sim-
ply inviting trouble.
Online auctions can be a very good way to get valuable merchandise at low prices. However one must
exercise some degree of caution when using these services. 
ptg999
Protecting Yourself against Cyber Crime 63
Protecting yourself from online harassment also has its own guidelines:
1. If you use chat rooms, discussion boards, and so forth, do not use your real name. Set up a sep-
arate email account with an anonymous service, such as Yahoo!, Gmail, or Hotmail. Then use
that account and a fake name online. This makes it very hard for an online stalker to trace back
to you personally.
2. If you are the victim of online harassment, keep all the emails in both digital and printed
format. Use some the investigative techniques we will explore later in this book to try and
identify the perpetrator. If you are successful, then you can take the emails and the information
on the perpetrator to law enforcement officials.
3. Do not, in any case, ignore cyber stalking. According to the Working to Halt Online Abuse
website,14 19% of cyber stalking cases escalate to stalking in the real world.
It is not the intent of this chapter or of this book to make you frightened about using the Internet. My
family routinely uses the Internet for entertainment, commerce, and informational purposes. One
simply needs to exercise some caution when using the Internet.
ptg999
CHAPTER 3 Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse64
Summary
Clearly, fraud and identity theft are very real and growing problems. In our modern age of instant
access to information and online purchasing, it is critical that every person take steps to protect them-
selves against this issue. Individuals must work to protect their privacy, using steps outlined in this
chapter. It is also imperative for law enforcement officers to obtain the skills needed to investigate and
solve these sorts of cyber crimes. 
Cyber stalking is one area that is often new to both civilians and law enforcement. It is very important
that both groups have a clear understanding of what is, and is not, cyber stalking. Unfortunately, cyber
stalking cases can escalate into real-world violence.

Case Study 
Consider the case of an intrepid identity thief. The perpetrator, Jane, encounters the victim, John,
online in a chat room. John is using his real first name, but only his last initial. However, over a
series of online conversations between Jane and John, he does reveal personal details about his
life (marital status, children, occupation, region he lives in, and so forth). Eventually, Jane offers
John some piece of information, such as perhaps an investment tip, as a trick to get John’s email
address from him. Once she gets his email address, an email exchange begins outside of the chat
room, wherein Jane purports to give John her real name, thus encouraging John to do the same.
Of course, the perpetrator’s name is fictitious, such as “Mary.” But Jane now has John’s real
name, city, marital status, occupation, and so on.
Jane has a number of options she can try, but we will choose a simple one. She begins by using
the phone book or the Web to get John’s home address and phone number. She can then use this
information to get John’s social security number, in a variety of ways. The most straightforward
would be to go through John’s trash while he is at work. However, if John works in a large com-
pany, Jane can just call (or enlist someone to call), claiming to be John’s wife or another close rel-
ative, wanting to verify personnel data. If Jane is clever enough, she may come away with John’s
social security number. Then it is a trivial matter (as we will see in Chapter 13, “Cyber Detective”)
to get John’s credit report and to get credit cards in his name.
From this scenario, consider the following questions:
1. What reasonable steps could John have taken to protect his identity in the chat room?
2. What steps should any employer take to prevent being unwittingly complicit in identity
theft?

Denial of Service Attacks
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Understand how denial of service (DoS) attacks are accomplished
■ Know how certain DoS attacks work, such as SYN flood, Smurf, and DDoS
■ Take specific measures to protect against denial of service attacks
■ Know how to defend against specific DoS attacks
Introduction
By now you are aware, in a general way, of the dangers of the Internet and have also explored a few
basic rules for protection on the Internet. In Chapter 3, “Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse,” you were
introduced to some fraud, stalking, and related crimes. It is now time to become more specific about
how attacks on systems are conducted. In this chapter, we will examine one category of attack that
might be used to cause harm to a target computer system. This chapter will describe for you, in depth,
the workings of the denial of service (DoS) attack. This threat is one of the most common attacks on
the Internet, so it is prudent for you to understand how it works and how to defend yourself against it.
Further, in the exercises at the end of the book, you will practice stopping a DoS attack. In information
security, the old adage that “knowledge is power” is not only good advice, but also an axiom upon
which to build your entire security outlook.
Denial of Service
As was said in the introduction, one of the most common and simplest forms of attack on a system is a
denial of service (DoS). This attack does not even attempt to intrude on your system or to obtain
Chapter 4
72
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 73
sensitive information; it simply aims to prevent legitimate users from accessing the system. This type
of attack is fairly easy to execute. The basic concept requires a minimum of technical skill. It is based
on the fact that any device has operational limits. For example, a truck can only carry a finite load or
travel a finite distance. Computers are no different than any other machine; they, too, have limits. Any
computer system, web server, or network can only handle a finite load. A workload for a computer
system may be defined by the number of simultaneous users, the size of files, the speed of data trans-
mission, or the amount of data stored. If you exceed any of those limits, the excess load will stop the
system from responding. For example, if you can flood a web server with more requests than it can
process, it will be overloaded and will no longer be able to respond to further requests (Webopedia,
2004). This reality underlies the DoS attack. Simply overload the system with requests, and it will no
longer be able to respond to legitimate users attempting to access the web server.
FYI: Buffer Overflows
A denial of service attack is one of the most common attacks on a system. Another common type
of attack is the buffer overflow. Which one is the leading form of attack is subject to debate among
the experts. Regardless, understanding DoS attacks and how to thwart them is clearly an
important component of system security. However, buffer-overflow attacks are becoming less
common since modern operating systems and web servers are no longer susceptible to them.
The only way to execute one is via a vulnerability in some application (perhaps an e-commerce
application).
Illustrating an Attack
One simple way to illustrate this attack, especially in a classroom setting, involves the use of the ping
command discussed in Chapter 2, “Networks and the Internet”:
1. Start a web server service running on one machine (you can use Apache, IIS, or any web
server). 
2. Ask several people to open their browsers and key the IP address of that machine in the address
bar. They should then be viewing the default website for that web server. 
Now you can do a rather primitive denial of service attack on the system. Recall from Chapter 2 that
typing in ping /h will show you all the options for the ping command. The –l option changes the size
of the packet you can send. Remember that a TCP packet can be only of a finite size. Thus, you are
going to set these packets to be almost as large as you can send. The –w option determines how many
milliseconds the ping utility will wait for a response from the target. You are going to use –0 so that the
ping utility does not wait at all. Then the –t instructs the ping utility to keep sending packets until
explicitly told to stop. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks74
1. Open the command prompt in Windows XP/Vista/7 (that is the shell in UNIX/Linux). 
2. Type in ping <address of target machine goes here>–l 65000 –w 0 –t. You will then see
something very much like what is shown in Figure 4.1. Note that, in the figure, I am pinging the
loop-back address for my own machine. You will want to substitute the address of the machine
on which you are running the web server.
FIGURE 4.1 Ping from the command prompt.
What is happening at this point is that this single machine is continually pinging away at the target
machine. Of course, just one machine in your classroom or lab that is simply pinging on your web
server is not going to adversely affect the web server. However, you can now, one by one, get other
machines in the classroom pinging the server in the same way. After each batch of three or four
machines you add, try to go to the web server’s default web page. After a certain threshold (certain
number of machines pinging the server), it will stop responding to requests, and you will no longer be
able to see the web page. 
How many machines it will take to deny service depends on the web server you are using. In order to
see this denial happen with as few machines involved as possible, you could use a very low-capacity
PC as your web server. For example, running an Apache web server on a simple laptop running
Windows 7 Home Edition, it can take about 15 machines each running about 10 different command
windows simultaneously pinging to cause a web server to stop responding to legitimate requests. This
strategy is, of course, counter to what you would normally select for a web server—no real web server
would be running on a simple laptop with Windows 7 Home Edition. Likewise, actual DoS attacks use
much more sophisticated methods. This simple exercise, however, should demonstrate for you the
basic principle behind the DoS attack: Simply flood the target machine with so many packets that it can
no longer respond to legitimate requests. 
Generally, the methods used for DoS attacks are significantly more sophisticated than the illustration.
For example, a hacker might develop a small virus whose sole purpose is to initiate a ping flood against
a predetermined target. Once the virus has spread, the various machines that are infected with that
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 75
virus, then begin their ping flood of the target system. This sort of denial of service is easy to do, and it
can be hard to stop. A denial of service that is launched from several different machines is called a
distributed denial of service (DDoS). 
Common Tools Used for DoS
As with any of the security issues discussed in this book, you will find that hackers have at their
disposal a vast array of tools with which to work. The DoS arena is no different. While it is certainly
well beyond the scope of this book to begin to categorize or discuss all of these tools, a brief intro-
duction to just a few of them will prove useful. The two tools discussed here, TFN and Stacheldraht,
are typical of the types of tools that someone wishing to perform a DoS attack would utilize.
TFN and TFN2K
TFN, also known as Tribal Flood Network, and TFN2K are not tools that can be used to perform a
DDoS. Both tools have been around for many years, and are still in use today. TFN2K is a newer
version of TFN that supports both Windows Server (2003 and 2008) and UNIX platforms (and can
easily be ported to additional platforms). It has some features that make detection more difficult than
its predecessor, including sending decoy information to avoid being traced. Experts at using TFN2K
can use the resources of a number of agents to coordinate an attack against one or more targets. Addi-
tionally, TFN and TFN2K can perform various attacks such as UDP flood attacks, ICMP flood attacks,
and TCP SYN flood attacks (all discussed later in this chapter).
TFN2K works on two fronts. First, there is a command-driven client on the master system. Second,
there is a daemon process operating on an agent system. The attack works like this:
1. The master instructs its agents to attack a list of designated targets. 
2. The agents respond by flooding the targets with a barrage of packets. 
With this tool, multiple agents, coordinated by the master, can work together during the attack to
disrupt access to the target. Additionally, there are a number of “safety” features for the attacker that
significantly complicates development of effective and efficient countermeasures for TFN2K.
■ Master-to-agent communications are encrypted and may be mixed with any number of decoy
packets.
■ Both master-to-agent communications and the attacks themselves can be sent via randomized
TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets. 
■ The master can falsify its IP address (spoof). 
ptg999
CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks76
Stacheldraht
Stacheldraht, which is German for “barbed wire,” is a DDoS attack tool that combines features of the
Trinoo DDoS tool (another common tool) with the source code from the TFN DDoS attack tool. Like
TFN2K, it adds encryption of communication between the attacker and the Stacheldraht masters. It
also adds an automatic updating of the agents. 
Stacheldraht can perform a variety of attacks including UDP flood, ICMP flood, TCP SYN flood, and
Smurf attacks. It also detects and automatically enables source address forgery.
DoS Weaknesses
The weakness in any DoS attack, from the attacker’s point of view, is that the flood of packets must be
sustained. As soon as the packets stop sending, the target system is back up. A DoS/DDoS attack,
however, is very often used in conjunction with another form of attack, such as disabling one side of a
connection in TCP hijacking or preventing authentication or logging between servers.
If the hacker is using a distributed attack, as soon as the administrators or owners of the infected
machines realize their machine is infected, they will take steps to remove the virus and thus stop the
attack. If a hacker attempts to launch an attack from her own machine, she must be aware that each
packet has the potential to be traced back to its source. This fact means that a single hacker using a DoS
will almost certainly be caught by the authorities. For this reason, the DDoS is quickly becoming the
most common type of DoS attack. The specifics of DDoS attacks will be discussed later in this chapter.
Specific DoS attacks
The basic concept for perpetrating a DoS attack is not complicated. The real problem for the attacker is
performing the attack without being caught. The next few sections of this chapter will examine some
specific types of DoS attacks and look at specific case studies. This information should help you gain a
deeper understanding of this particular Internet threat. 
TCP SYN Flood Attack
One popular version of the DoS attack is the SYN flood. This particular attack depends on the hacker’s
knowledge of how connections are made to a server. When a session is initiated between the client and
server in a network using the TCP protocol, a packet is sent to the server with a 1-bit flag called a SYN
flag set. SYN is short for synchronize. And this packet is literally asking the target server to please
synchronize communications. The server will then allocate appropriate resources and then send to the
client a packet with both the SYN (synchronize) and the ACK (acknowledge) flags set. The client
machine is then supposed to respond with an ACK flag set. This is called the three-way handshake and
is summarized as follows:
1. Client sends a packet with the SYN flag set.
2. Server allocates resources for the client and then responds with the SYN and ACK flags set.
3. Client responds with the ACK flag set. 
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 77
There have been a number of well-known SYN flood attacks on web servers. The reason for the popu-
larity of this attack type is that any machine that engages in TCP communication is vulnerable to it—
and all machines connected to the Internet engage in TCP communications. Such communication is
obviously the entire reason for web servers. The easiest way to block DoS attacks is via firewall rules.
We will discuss firewalls in detail in Chapter 12, “Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare.” There
are, however, several methods and techniques you can implement on individual servers to protect
against these attacks. The basic defensive techniques are as follows:
■ Micro blocks
■ SYN cookies
■ RST cookies
■ Stack tweaking
Some of these methods require more technical sophistication than others. These methods will be
discussed in general here. When you are entrusted with defending a system against these forms of
attacks, you can select the methods most appropriate for your network environment and your level of
expertise and examine it further at that time. The specifics of how to implement any of these methods
will depend on the operating system that your web server is using. You will need to consult your oper-
ating system’s documentation, or appropriate websites, in order to find explicit instruction on how to
implement methods.
Micro Blocks
A micro block works by simply allocating a micro-record instead of allocating a complete connection
object (an entire buffer segment) to the SYN object. In this way, an incoming SYN object can allocate
as little as 16 bytes of space, making it significantly more difficult to flood a system.
SYN Cookies
As the name SYN cookies suggests, this method uses cookies, not unlike the standard cookies used on
many websites. With this method, the system does not immediately create a buffer space in memory for
the handshaking process. Rather, it first sends a SYN+ACK (the acknowledgment signal that begins the
handshaking process). The SYN+ACK contains a carefully constructed cookie, generated as a hash
that contains the IP address, port number, and other information from the client machine requesting the
connection. When the client responds with a normal ACK (acknowledgment), the information from
that cookie will be included, which the server then verifies. Thus, the system does not fully allocate any
memory until the third stage of the handshaking process. This enables the system to continue to operate
normally; typically, the only effect seen is the disabling of large windows. However, the cryptographic
hashing used in SYN cookies is fairly resource intensive, so system administrators that expect a great
deal of incoming connections may choose not to use this defensive technique.
ptg999
CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks78
FYI: Hashing
A hash value is a number generated from a string of text. The hash is significantly smaller than the
text itself and is generated by a formula in such a way that it is extremely unlikely that some other
text will produce the same hash value. Hashing plays a role in security when it is used to ensure that
transmitted messages have not been tampered with. To do this, the sender generates a hash of the
message, encrypts it, and sends it with the message itself. The recipient then decrypts both the
message and the hash, produces another hash from the received message, and compares the two
hashes. If they are the same, there is a very high probability that the message was transmitted intact.
We will discuss hashing in more detail in Chapter 8, “Encryption,” when we discuss encryption.
RST Cookies
Another cookie method that is easier to implement than SYN cookies is the RST cookie. In this
method, the server sends a wrong SYN+ACK back to the client. The client should then generate an
RST packet telling the server that something is wrong. Because the client sent back a packet notifying
the server of the error, the server now knows the client request is legitimate and can now accept
incoming connections from that client in the normal fashion. This method has two disadvantages. It
might cause problems with older Windows machines and/or machines that are communicating from
behind firewalls.
Stack Tweaking
The method of stack tweaking involves altering the TCP stack on the server so that it will take less time
to timeout when a SYN connection is left incomplete. Unfortunately, this protective method will just
make executing a SYN flood against that target more difficult; to a determined hacker, the attack is still
possible. 
In Practice
Stack Tweaking
The process of stack tweaking is often quite complicated, depending on the operating system.
Some operating systems’ documentation provides no help on this subject. For these reasons, this
method is usually only used by very advanced network administrators and is not recommended
unless you have a very solid knowledge of the operating system with which you are working.
Smurf IP Attack
The Smurf attack is a very popular version of the DoS attack. An ICMP (Internet Control Message
Protocol) packet is sent out to the broadcast address of the network. Since it is broadcast, it responds by
echoing the packet out to all hosts on the network, who then send it to the spoofed source address.
Also, the spoofed source address can be anywhere on the Internet, not just on the local subnet. If the
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 79
hacker can continually send such packets, she will cause the network itself to perform a DoS attack on
one or more of its member servers. This attack is clever and rather simple. The only problem for the
hacker is getting the packets started on the target network. This task can be accomplished via some
software, such as a virus or Trojan horse, that will begin sending the packets. 
In a Smurf attack, there are three people/systems involved: the attacker, the intermediary (who can also
be a victim), and the victim. The attacker first sends an ICMP echo request packet to the intermediary’s
IP broadcast addresses. Since this is sent to the IP broadcast address, many of the machines on the
intermediary’s network will receive this request packet and will send an ICMP echo reply packet back.
If all the machines on a network are responding to this request, the network becomes congested and
there can be outages.
The attacker impacts the third party—the intended victim—by creating forged packets that contain the
spoofed source address of the victim. Therefore, when all the machines on the intermediary’s network
start replying to the echo request, those replies will flood the victim’s network. Thus, another network
becomes congested and could become unusable.
The Smurf attack is an example of the creativity that some malicious parties can employ. It is some-
times viewed as the digital equivalent of the biological process in an auto-immune disorder. With such
disorders, the immune system attacks the patient’s own body. In a Smurf attack, the network performs
a DoS attack on one of its own systems. This method’s cleverness illustrates why it is important that
you attempt to work creatively and in a forward-thinking manner if you are responsible for system
security in your network. The perpetrators of computer attacks are inventive and always coming up
with new techniques. If your defense is less creative and clever than the attackers’ defense, then it is
simply a matter of time before your system is compromised.
There are several ways to protect your system against this problem. One is to guard against Trojan
horses. More will be said about the Trojan horse attack in later chapters; however, having policies
prohibiting employees from downloading applications will help. Also, having adequate virus scanners
can go a long way in protecting your system from a Trojan horse and, thus, a Smurf attack. It is also
imperative that you use a proxy server, which was discussed in Chapter 2. If the internal IP addresses
of your network are not known, then it is more difficult to target one in a Smurf attack. Probably the
best way to protect your system is to combine these defenses along with prohibiting directed broad-
casts and patching the hosts to refuse to reply to any directed broadcasts.
UDP Flood Attack
UDP, as you will recall from Chapter 2, is a connectionless protocol that does not require any
connection setup procedure prior to transferring data. In a UDP flood attack, the attacker sends a UDP
packet to a random port on a target system. When the target system receives a UDP packet, it automat-
ically determines what application is waiting on the destination port. In this case, since there is no
application waiting on the port, the target system will generate an ICMP packet of “destination
unreachable” and attempt to send it back to the forged source address. If enough UDP packets are
delivered to ports on the target, the system will become overloaded trying to determine awaiting appli-
cations (which do not exist) and then generating and sending packets back. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks80
ICMP Flood Attack
There are two basic types of ICMP flood attacks: floods and nukes. An ICMP flood is usually accom-
plished by broadcasting a large number of either pings or UDP packets. Like other flood attacks, the
idea is to send so much data to the target system that it slows down. If it can be forced to slow down
enough, the target will time out (not send replies fast enough) and be disconnected from the Internet.
ICMP nukes exploit known bugs in specific operating systems. The attacker sends a packet of infor-
mation that he knows the operating system on the target system cannot handle. In many cases, this will
cause the target system to lock up completely.
The Ping of Death (PoD)
Recall from Chapter 2 that TCP packets are of limited size. In some cases, simply sending a packet that
is too large can shut down a target machine. This action is referred to as the ping of death (PoD). It
works simply by overloading the target system. The hacker sends merely a single ping, but he does so
with a very large packet and thus can shut down some machines.
This attack is quite similar to the classroom example discussed earlier in this chapter. The aim in both
cases is to overload the target system and cause it to quit responding. PoD works to compromise
systems that cannot deal with extremely large packet sizes. If successful, the server will actually shut
down completely. It can, of course, be rebooted.
The only real safeguard against PoD is to ensure that all operating systems and software are routinely
patched. This attack relies on vulnerabilities in the way a particular operating system (or application)
handles abnormally large TCP packets. When such vulnerabilities are discovered, it is customary for
the vendor to release a patch. The possibility of PoD is one reason, among many, why you must keep
patches updated on all of your systems.
Teardrop Attack
In a teardrop attack, the attacker sends a fragmented message. The two fragments overlap in ways that
make it impossible to reassemble them properly without destroying the individual packet headers.
Therefore, when the victim attempts to reconstruct the message, the message is destroyed. This causes
the target system to halt or crash. There are a number of variations on the basic teardrop attack that are
available such as TearDrop2, Boink, targa, Nestea Boink, NewTear, and SYNdrop.
Land Attack
A land attack is probably the simplest in concept. The attacker sends a forged packet with the same
source IP address and destination IP address (the target’s IP address). The method is to drive the target
system “crazy” by having it attempt to send messages to and from itself. The victim system will often
be confused and will crash or reboot.
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 81
Echo/Chargen Attack
The character generator (chargen) service was designed primarily for testing purposes. It simply
generates a stream of characters. In an echo/chargen attack, this service is abused by attackers who
exhaust the target system’s resources. The attacker accomplishes this by creating a spoofed network
session that appears to come from that local system’s echo service and which is pointed at the chargen
service to form a “loop.” This session will cause huge amounts of data to be passed in an endless loop.
This constant looping causes a heavy load to the system. Alternately, if the spoofed session is pointed
at a system’s echo service, it will cause heavy network traffic that slows down the target’s network.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
Another form of trickery is the distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). As with all such denial
attacks, it is accomplished by the hacker getting a number of machines to attack the target. However,
this attack works a bit differently than other DoS attacks. Rather than getting computers to attack the
target, one of the ways the hacker accomplishes a DDoS is to trick Internet routers into attacking a
target. Another form of DDoS relies on compromised (zombie) hosts to simultaneously attack a given
target with a large number of packets.
Recall from the discussion of ports in Chapter 2 that many of the routers on the Internet backbone
communicate on port 179 (Gibson, 2002). They use Border Gateway Protocol to exchange routing
information with each other. This attack exploits that communication line and gets routers to attack a
target system. What makes this attack particularly wicked is that it does not require the routers in
question to be compromised in any way. Instead, the hacker sends a stream of packets to the various
routers requesting a connection. The packets have been altered so that they appear to come from the
target system’s IP address. The routers respond by initiating connections with the target system. What
occurs then is a flood of connections from multiple routers, all hitting the same target system. This
flood has the effect of rendering the system unreachable.
Real-World Examples
A good deal of time has been spent discussing the basics of how various DoS attacks are conducted. By
now, you should have a firm grasp of what a DoS attack is and have a basic understanding of how it
works. It is now time to begin discussing specific, real-world examples of such attacks. This section will
take the theoretical knowledge you have gained and give you real-world examples of its application.
MyDoom
One of the most well publicized DoS attacks was the MyDoom attack. While this attack is a few years
old, it is an excellent one to study. This threat was a classically distributed DoS attack. The virus/worm
would email itself to everyone in your address book and then, at a preset time, all infected machines
would begin a coordinated attack on www.sco.com (Network World, 2004). Estimates put the number
of infected machines between 500,000 and 1 million. This attack was successful and promptly shut
down the SCO website. It should be noted that well before the day that the DoS attack was actually
ptg999
CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks82
executed, network administrators and home users were well aware of what MyDoom would do. There
were also several tools available free of charge on the Internet for removing the virus/worm. However,
it appears that many people did not take the steps necessary to clean their machines of this virus/worm.
What is interesting is that MyDoom is still causing problems. In July 2009, there was a DoS that
utilized MyDoom as a back door to launch a DoS attack against South Korean and United States web
servers.
FYI: Virus or Worm?
Definitions of the terms virus and worm are widely debated among the experts. And, depending
upon the definition, what some would call a virus, others would call a worm. One general
distinction that is accepted by many is that worms do not require direct human interaction to
propagate, whereas viruses do. If you accept this definition, then both MyDoom and Slammer are
worms. To avoid confusion on this issue, however, the term virus/worm will be used.
One thing that makes this attack so interesting is that it is clearly an example of domestic cyber
terrorism (although it is certain that the creators of MyDoom would probably see it differently). (Cyber
terrorism will be discussed further in Chapter 12, “Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare.”) For
those readers who do not know the story, it will be examined here briefly. Santa Cruz Operations
(SCO) makes a version of the UNIX operating system. Like most UNIX versions, their version is
copyright protected. Several months before this attack, SCO began accusing certain Linux distributions
of containing segments of SCO UNIX code. SCO sent demand letters to many Linux users demanding
license fees. Many people in the Linux community viewed this request as simply an attempt to
undermine the growing popularity of Linux, an open-source operating system. SCO went even further
and filed suit against major companies that were distributing Linux (Software Patent Workgroup,
2003). This claim by SCO seemed unfounded to many legal and technology analysts. It was also
viewed with great suspicion because SCO had close ties to Microsoft, which had been trying desper-
ately to stop the growing popularity of Linux. 
Many analysts feel that the MyDoom virus/worm was created by some individual (or group of indi-
viduals) who felt that the Santa Cruz Operations tactics were unacceptable. The hackers wished to
cause economic harm to SCO and damage its public image. This probable motive makes this case
clearly one of domestic economic terrorism: One group attacks the technological assets of another
group based on an ideological difference. Prior to this virus/worm, there were numerous website
defacements and other small-scale attacks that were part of ideological conflicts. However, this
virus/worm was the first such attack to be so widespread and successful. This incident began a new
trend in information warfare. As technology becomes less expensive and the tactics more readily
available, you can expect to see an increase in this sort of attack in the coming years.
ptg999
Illustrating an Attack 83
Anonymous Uses DoS
On December 8, 2010, the infamous hacker group Anonymous launched multiple DDoS attacks on
various financial companies, including Mastercard.com, PayPal, Visa.com and PostFinance. These
sites were brought down for over 16 hours. The attacks were launched because these sites refused to
process donations for Wikileaks. The group Anonymous is a supporter of Wikileaks founder Julian
Assange.
How to Defend against DoS Attacks
There is no guaranteed way to prevent all DoS attacks, just as there is no sure way to prevent any
hacking attack. However, there are steps you can take to minimize the danger. Some methodologies,
such as SYN cookies and RST cookies, have already been mentioned. In this section, a few of the steps
you can take to make your system less susceptible to a DoS attack will be examined. 
One of the first things for you to consider is how these attacks are perpetrated. They may be executed
via ICMP packets that are used to send error messages on the Internet or are sent by the ping and
traceroute utilities. If you have a firewall (and you absolutely should have one), then simply config-
uring it to refuse ICMP packets from outside your network will be a major step in protecting your
network from DoS attacks. Since DoS/DDoS attacks can be executed via a wide variety of protocols,
you can also configure your firewall to disallow any incoming traffic at all, regardless of what protocol
or port it occurs on. This step may seem radical, but it is certainly a secure one.
In Practice
Blocking ICMP Packets
There are very few legitimate reasons (and, some would argue, no good reasons) for an ICMP
packet from outside your network to enter your network. Thus, blocking such packets is very often
used as one part of the strategy to defend against DoS attacks. Incidentally, that will also make it
more difficult for an attacker to scan your network (as we will see in Chapter 12).
It is also possible to detect some threats from certain DoS tools, such as TFN2K, by using information
tools like NetStat. Many of these tools can be configured to look for the SYN_RECEIVED state, which
could indicate a SYN flood attack.
If your network is large enough to have internal routers, then you can configure those routers to
disallow any traffic that does not originate with your network. In that way, should packets make it past
your firewall, they will not be propagated throughout the network. You should also consider disabling
directed IP broadcasts on all routers. This strategy will prevent the router from sending broadcast
packets to all machines on the network, thus stopping many DoS attacks. Additionally, you can install
a filter on the router to verify that external packets actually have external IP addresses and that internal
IPs have internal IP addresses.

CHAPTER 4 Denial of Service Attacks84
Because many distributed DoS attacks depend on “unwitting” computers being used as launch points,
one way to reduce such attacks is to protect your computer against virus attacks and Trojan horses.
This problem will be discussed in more detail in a later chapter, but for now, it is important that you
remember three things:
■ Always use virus-scanning software and keep it updated.
■ Always keep operating system and software patches updated.
■ Have an organizational policy stating that employees cannot download anything onto their ma-
chines unless the download has been cleared by the IT staff.
As previously stated, none of these steps will make your network totally secure from either being the
victim of a DoS attack or being the launch point for one, but they will help reduce the chances of either
occurring. A good resource for this topic is the SANS Institute website, at www.sans.org/dosstep/. This
site has some good tips on how to prevent DoS attacks.

Summary
DoS attacks are among the most common attacks on the Internet. They are easy to perform, do not
require a great deal of sophistication on the part of the perpetrator, and can have devastating effects on
the target system. Only virus attacks are more common. (And, in some cases, the virus can be the
source of the DoS attack.) In the exercises, you will practice stopping a DoS.

EXERCISES
EXERCISE 4.1: Executing a DoS
Note that Exercise 1 is best done in a laboratory setting where there are several machines available for
this purpose.
1. Set up one machine (preferably a machine with very limited capacity) to run a small web server.
(You can download Apache for free for either Windows or Linux from www.apache.org.)
2. Use the ping utility with various other computers to attempt to perform a simple DoS on that
web server. This attempt is accomplished by getting other machines to begin a continuous
ping of that target machine using the previously mentioned ping command of ping –l 65000
–w0 –t <insert target address here>.

In Chapter 4, “Denial of Service Attacks,” we examined the denial of service attack. It is a very
common attack and one that can easily be perpetrated. In this chapter, you will continue your exami-
nation of security threats by learning about several other types of attacks. First, you will learn about
virus outbreaks. Our discussion will focus on crucial information about how and why virus attacks
work, including their deployment through Trojan horses. This chapter is not a “how to create your own
virus” tutorial, but rather an introduction to the concepts underlying these attacks as well as an exami-
nation of some specific case studies.

Viruses 93
This chapter will also explore buffer-overflow attacks, spyware, and several other forms of malware.
Each of these brings a unique approach to an attack, and each needs to be considered when defending
a system. Your ability to defend against such attacks will be enhanced by expanding your knowledge of
how they work. In the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will have the opportunity to research
preventative methods for viruses and to try out antivirus methods from McAfee and Norton.
Viruses
By definition, a computer virus is a program that self-replicates. Generally, a virus will also have some
other unpleasant function, but the self-replication and rapid spread are the hallmarks of a virus. Often
this growth, in and of itself, can be a problem for an infected network. The last chapter discussed the
Slammer virus and the effects of its rapid, high-volume scanning. Any rapidly spreading virus can
reduce the functionality and responsiveness of a network. Simply by exceeding the traffic load that a
network was designed to carry, the network may be rendered temporarily nonfunctional. The infamous
I Love You virus actually had no negative payload, but the shear volume of emails it generated bogged
down many networks.
How a Virus Spreads
A virus will usually spread primarily in one of two ways. The first is to simply scan your computer for
connections to a network, then copy itself to other machines on the network to which your computer
has access. This is actually the most efficient way for a virus to spread. However, this method requires
more programming skill than other methods. The more common method is to read your email address
book and email itself to everyone in your address book. Programming this is a trivial task, which
explains why it is so common.
The latter method is, by far, the most common method for virus propagation, and Microsoft Outlook
may be the one email program most often hit with such virus attacks. The reason is not so much a
security flaw in Outlook as it is the ease of working with Outlook. All Microsoft Office products are
made so that a legitimate programmer who is writing software for a business can access many of the
application’s internal objects and thereby easily create applications that integrate the applications
within the Microsoft Office suite. For example, a programmer could write an application that would
access a Word document, import an Excel spreadsheet, and then use Outlook to automatically email the
resulting document to interested parties. Microsoft has done a good job of making this process very
easy, for it usually takes a minimum amount of programming to accomplish these tasks. Using
Outlook, it takes less than five lines of code to reference Outlook and send out an email. This means a
program can literally cause Outlook itself to send emails, unbeknownst to the user. There are numerous
code examples on the Internet that show exactly how to do this, free for the taking. For this reason, it
does not take a very skilled programmer to be able to access your Outlook address book and automati-
cally send emails. Essentially, the ease of programming Outlook is why there are so many virus attacks
that target Outlook.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware94
While the overwhelming majority of virus attacks spread by attaching themselves to the victim’s
existing email software, some recent virus outbreaks have used other methods for propagation, such as
their own internal email engine. Another virus propagation method is to simply copy itself across a
network. Virus outbreaks that spread via multiple routes are becoming more common.
The method of delivering a payload can be rather simplistic and rely more on end-user negligence than
on the skill of the virus writer. Enticing users to go to websites or open files they should not is a
common method for delivering a virus and one that requires no programming skill at all. Regardless of
the way a virus arrives at your doorstep, once it is on your system, it will attempt to spread and, in
many cases, will also attempt to cause some harm to your system. Once a virus is on your system, it
can do anything that any legitimate program can do. That means it could potentially delete files,
change system settings, or cause other harm.
Recent Virus Examples
The threat from virus attacks cannot be overstated. While there are many web pages that give virus
information, in my opinion, there are only a handful of web pages that consistently give the latest, most
reliable, most detailed information on virus outbreaks. Any security professional will want to consult
these sites on a regular basis. You can read more about any virus, past or current, at the following
websites:
■ www.f-secure.com/virus-info/virus-news/
■ www.cert.org/nav/index_red.html
■ http://securityresponse.symantec.com/
■ http://vil.nai.com/vil/
The sections below will look at a few recent virus outbreaks (and some not so recent) and review how
they operated and what they did.
W32/Netsky-P
This worm was first found in 2006 but is still going around in 2011. It is a fairly typical virus in that it
spreads primarily through email, but also uses file sharing utilities to copy itself. It also copies itself to
various directories and shared folders. In one interesting twist, it attempts to copy itself to
C:\WINDOWS\FVProtect.exe. The name would make many people (including otherwise technically
savvy people) think this program was actually part of some antivirus utility. It also copies itself to
C:\WINDOWS\userconfig9x.dll. Again, it would appear to be a system file, thus making people less
likely to delete it.
This is also a classic worm/virus in that the email it sends out had a fairly generic title and content that
attempts to get the recipient to open the attachment. For example, the body of the message might say
something like “Please see the attached file for details” or “Your file is attached.”
ptg999
Viruses 95
Troj/Invo-Zip
This particular worm is a classic worm/Trojan horse. It was first reported in mid 2010. It is transmitted
as a zip file attached to an email. The email claims that the zip file contains data related to an invoice,
tax issue, or similar urgent paperwork. This is a classic example of attempting to entice the recipient to
open the attachment. And in this case, the recipients most likely to be enticed would be businesspeople.
If the recipient does open the attachment, then he or she will have installed spyware on his machine
that would first disable the firewall then start attempting to capture information including financial
data, and even taking screenshots of the user’s desktop.
MacDefender
This virus is very interesting for multiple reasons. First because it specifically targets Macintosh
computers. Most experts have long agreed that Apple products remained relatively virus free simply
because their products did not have enough market share to attract the attention of virus writers. It has
long been suspected that if Apple garnered a greater market share, they would also begin to get more
virus attacks. That has proven to be true.
This virus was first seen in the early months of 2011. It is embedded in some web pages and when a
user visits those web pages, he or she is given a fake virus scan that tells the user that they have a virus
and it needs to be fixed. The “fix” is actually downloading a virus. The point of the virus is to get end
users to purchase the MacDefender “antivirus” product. This is the second reason this case is note-
worthy. Fake antivirus attacks, also known as scareware, have been becoming increasingly common.
The Sobig Virus
This is obviously not a recent virus, as it was first found in 2003. However, it is an excellent virus to
study. This virus is important to study because it received the most media attention and perhaps caused
the most harm in 2003.The first interesting thing to study about this virus was how it spread. It spread
utilizing a multimodal approach to spreading. This means that it used more than one mechanism to
spread and infect new machines. It would copy itself to any shared drives on your network and it would
email itself out to everyone in your address book. For these reasons, this virus was particularly virulent,
and this is also why it is important to study.
FYI: Virulent Virus
The term virulent means essentially the same thing in reference to a computer virus as it does to a
biological virus. It is a measure of how rapidly the infection spreads and how easily it infects new
targets.
In the case of Sobig, if one person on a network was unfortunate enough to open an email containing
the virus, not only would his machine be infected, but so would every shared drive on that network to
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware96
which this person had access. However, Sobig, like most email-distributed virus attacks, had tell-tale
signs in the email subject or title that could be used to identify the email as one infected by a virus. The
email would have some enticing title such as “here is the sample” or “the document” to encourage you
to be curious enough to open the attached file. The virus would then copy itself into the Windows
System directory. 
This particular virus spread so far and infected so many networks that the multiple copying of the virus
alone was enough to bring some networks to a standstill. This virus did not destroy files or damage the
system, but it generated a great deal of traffic that bogged down the networks infected by it. The virus
itself was of moderate sophistication. Once it was out, however, many variants began to spring up,
further complicating the situation. One of the effects of some variants of Sobig was to download a file
from the Internet that would then cause printing problems. Some network printers would just start
printing junk. The Sobig.E variant would even write to the Windows Registry, causing itself to be in the
computer startup (F-Secure, 2003). These complex characteristics indicate that the creator knew how
to access the Windows Registry, access shared drives, alter the Windows startup, and access Outlook.
This brings up the issue of virus variants and how they occur. In the case of a biological virus, muta-
tions in the genetic code cause new virus strains to appear, and the pressures of natural selection allow
some of these strains to evolve into entirely new species of viruses. Obviously, the biological method is
not what occurs with a computer virus. With a computer virus, what occurs is that some intrepid
programmer with malicious intent will get a copy of a virus (perhaps her own machine becomes
infected) and will then reverse-engineer it. Since many virus attacks are in the form of a script attached
to an email, unlike traditionally compiled programs, the source code of these attacks is readily readable
and alterable. The programmer in question then simply takes the original virus code and introduces
some change, then re-releases the variant. Frequently, the people who are caught for virus creation are
actually the developers of the variants who lacked the skill of the original virus writer and therefore
were easily caught.
The Mimail Virus
This is another older virus that is still worth studying. The Mimail virus did not receive as much media
attention as Sobig, but it had its intriguing characteristics. This virus not only collected email addresses
from your address book, but also from other documents on your machine (Gudmundsson, 2004). Thus,
if you had a Word document on your hard drive and an email address was in that document, Mimail
would find it. This strategy meant that Mimail would spread farther than many other viruses. Mimail
had its own built-in email engine, so it did not have to “piggy back” off your email client. It could
spread regardless of what email software you used. 
These two variations from most virus attacks made Mimail interesting to people who study computer
viruses. There are a variety of techniques that allow you to programmatically open and process files on
your computer; however, most virus attacks do not employ them. The scanning of the document for
email addresses indicates a certain level of skill and creativity on the part of the virus writer. In this
author’s opinion, Mimail was not the work of an amateur, but rather a person with professional-level
programming skill.
ptg999
Viruses 97
The Bagle Virus
This is the last of the “historical viruses” that we will examine. It is noteworthy in that it combined
email attachments along with the fake virus warning. The Bagle virus began to spread rapidly in the
fourth quarter of 2003. The email it sent claimed to be from your system administrator. It would tell
you that your email account had been infected by a virus and that you should open the attached file to
get instructions. Once you opened the attached file, your system was infected. This virus was particu-
larly interesting for several reasons. To begin with, it spread both through email and copying itself to
shared folders. Second, it could also scan files on your PC looking for email addresses. Finally, it
would disable processes used by antivirus scanners. In biological terms, this virus took out your
computer’s “immune system.” The disabling of virus scanners is a new twist that indicates at least
moderate programming skills on the part of the virus creator.
A Nonvirus Virus
Another new type of virus has been gaining popularity in the past few years, and that is the “nonvirus
virus” or, put simply, a hoax. Rather than actually writing a virus, a hacker sends an email to every address
he has. The email claims to be from some well-known antivirus center and warns of a new virus that is
circulating. The email instructs people to delete some file from their computer to get rid of the virus. The
file, however, is not really a virus but part of a computer’s system. The jdbgmgr.exe virus hoax used this
scheme (Rhode Island Soft Systems, Inc., 2003). It encouraged the reader to delete a file that was actually
needed by the system. Surprisingly, a number of people followed this advice and not only deleted the file,
but promptly emailed their friends and colleagues to warn them to delete the file from their machines.
FYI: The Morris Internet Worm
The Morris worm was one of the first computer worms ever to be distributed over the Internet. And
it was certainly the first to gain any significant media attention.
Robert Tappan Morris, Jr., then a student at Cornell University, wrote this worm and launched it
from an MIT system on November 2, 1988. Morris did not actually intend to cause any damage
with the worm. Instead, he wanted the worm to reveal bugs in the programs it exploited in order to
spread. However, bugs in the code allowed an individual computer to be infected multiple times,
and the worm became a menace. Each additional “infection” spawned a new process on the
infected computer. At a certain point, the high number of processes running on an infected
machine slowed down the computer to the point of being unusable. At least 6,000 UNIX machines
were infected with this worm.
Morris was convicted of violating the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and was sentenced to
a $10,000 fine, 3 years probation, and 400 hours of community service. But perhaps the greatest
impact of this worm was that it led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team
(CERT). CERT is an organization hosted at Carnegie Mellon University (www.cert.org/) that is a
repository for security bulletins, information, and guidelines. CERT is a source that any security
professional should be familiar with.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware98
Rules for Avoiding Viruses
You should notice a common theme with all virus attacks (except the hoax), which is that they want
you to open some type of attachment. The most common way for a virus to spread is as an email
attachment. This realization leads to some simple rules that will drastically reduce the odds of
becoming infected with a virus.
■ Use a virus scanner. McAfee and Norton (explored in the exercises at the end of this chapter)
are the two most widely accepted and used virus scanners. However, Kaspersky and AVG are
also good, reputable choices. Each costs about $30 per year to keep your virus scanner updated.
Do it. Now each antivirus has its proponents and detractors—I won’t delve into the opinions on
which is better. For most users, any of the four major antivirus programs would be effective. I
personally rotate which one I use periodically, just so I can stay familiar with all of them.
■ If you are not sure about an attachment, do not open it.
■ You might even exchange a code word with friends and colleagues. Tell them that if they wish
to send you an attachment, they should put the code word in the title of the message. Without
seeing the code word, you will not open any attachment.
■ Do not believe “security alerts” that are sent to you. Microsoft does not send out alerts in this
manner. Check the Microsoft website regularly, as well as one of the antivirus websites previ-
ously mentioned.
These rules will not make your system 100% virus proof, but they will go a long way toward protecting
your system.
Trojan Horses
Recall from earlier chapters that Trojan horse is a term for a program that looks benign but actually has
a malicious purpose. We have already seen viruses that are delivered via a Trojan horse. You might
receive or download a program that appears to be a harmless business utility or game. More likely, the
Trojan horse is just a script attached to a benign-looking email. When you run the program or open the
attachment, it does something else other than or in addition to what you thought it would. It might
■ Download harmful software from a website.
■ Install a key logger or other spyware on your machine.
■ Delete files.
■ Open a back door for a hacker to use.
It is common to find combination virus plus Trojan horse attacks. In those scenarios, the Trojan horse
spreads like a virus. The MyDoom virus opened a port on your machine that a later virus, doomjuice,
would exploit, thus making MyDoom a combination virus and Trojan horse.
ptg999
Trojan Horses 99
A Trojan horse could also be crafted especially for an individual. If a hacker wished to spy on a certain
individual, such as the company accountant, he could craft a program specifically to attract that
person’s attention. For example, if he knew the accountant was an avid golfer, he could write a program
that computed handicap and listed best golf courses. He would post that program on a free web server.
He would then email a number of people, including the accountant, telling them about the free
software. The software, once installed, could check the name of the currently logged-on person. If the
logged-on name matched the accountant’s name, the software could then go out, unknown to the user,
and download a key logger or other monitoring application. If the software did not damage files or
replicate itself, then it would probably go undetected for quite a long time. There have been a number
of Trojan horses through the years. One of the earliest and most widely known was Back Orifice.
FYI: Virus or Worm?
As noted in the previous chapter, there is disagreement among the experts as to the distinction
between a virus and a worm. Some experts would call MyDoom (as well as Sasser, which will be
discussed later) a worm because it spread without human intervention. However, I would define a
virus as any file that can self replicate, and a worm is any program that can propagate without
human interference. This is also the most common definition you will find among security experts.
Such a program could be within the skill set of virtually any moderately competent programmer. This
is one reason that many organizations have rules against downloading any software onto company
machines. I am unaware of any actual incident of a Trojan horse being custom tailored in this fashion.
However, it is important to remember that those creating virus attacks tend to be innovative people.
It is also important to note that creating a Trojan horse does not require programming skill. There are
free tools on the Internet, such as EliteWrapper, that allow one to combine two programs together, one
hidden and one not. So one could easily take a virus and combine it with, for example, a poker game.
The end user would only see the poker game, but when it was run it would launch the virus. 
Another scenario to consider is one that would be quite devastating. Without divulging programming
details, the basic premise will be outlined here to illustrate the grave dangers of Trojan horses. Imagine
a small application that displays a series of unflattering pictures of Osama Bin Laden. This application
would probably be popular with many people in the United States, particularly people in the military,
intelligence community, or defense-related industries. Now assume that this application simply sits
dormant on the machine for a period of time. It need not replicate like a virus because the computer
user will probably send it to many of his associates. On a certain date and time, the software connects
to any drive it can, including network drives, and begins deleting all files. If such a Trojan horse were
released “in the wild,” within 30 days it would probably be shipped to thousands, perhaps millions, of
people. Imagine the devastation when thousands of computers begin deleting files and folders.
This scenario is mentioned precisely to frighten you a little. Computer users, including professionals
who should know better, routinely download all sorts of things from the Internet, such as amusing flash
videos and cute games. Every time an employee downloads something of this nature, there is the
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware100
chance of downloading a Trojan horse. One need not be a statistician to realize that if employees
continue that practice long enough, they will eventually download a Trojan horse onto a company
machine. If so, hopefully the virus will not be as vicious as the theoretical one just outlined here.
The Buffer-Overflow Attack
You have become knowledgeable about a number of ways to attack a target system: denial of service,
virus, and Trojan horse. While these attacks are probably the most common, they are not the only
methods. Another method of attacking a system is called a buffer-overflow (or buffer-overrun) attack.
A buffer-overflow attack happens when one tries to put more data in a buffer than it was designed to
hold (searchSecurity.com, 2004a). Any program that communicates with the Internet or a private
network must take in some data. This data is stored, at least temporarily, in a space in memory called a
buffer. If the programmer who wrote the application was careful, when you try to place too much infor-
mation into a buffer, that information is then either simply truncated or outright rejected. Given the
number of applications that might be running on a target system and the number of buffers in each
application, the chances of having at least one buffer that was not written properly are significant
enough to cause any prudent person some concern. 
Someone who is moderately skilled in programming can write a program that purposefully writes more
into the buffer than it can hold. For example, if the buffer can hold 1024 bytes of data and you try to fill
it with 2048 bytes, the extra 1024 bytes is then simply loaded into memory. If that extra data is actually
a malicious program, then it has just been loaded into memory and is thus now running on the target
system. Or, perhaps the perpetrator simply wants to flood the target machine’s memory, thus over-
writing other items that are currently in memory and causing them to crash. Either way, the buffer
overflow is a very serious attack. 
Fortunately, buffer-overflow attacks are a bit harder to execute than a DoS or simple Microsoft Outlook
script virus. To create a buffer-overflow attack, you must have a good working knowledge of some
programming language (C or C++ is often chosen) and understand the target operating system/appli-
cation well enough to know whether it has a buffer overflow weakness and how that weakness might
be exploited.
It must be noted that modern operating systems and web servers are not susceptible to this attack.
Windows 95 was quite susceptible, but it has been many years since a Windows operating system was
susceptible. Certainly Windows 7 cannot be compromised with a buffer overflow. However, the same
cannot be necessarily said for all the custom applications developed to run on various systems. It is
always possible that an Internet-enabled application, including but not limited to web applications,
might be susceptible to this attack.
Essentially, this vulnerability only exists if programmers fail to program correctly. If all programs
truncate extra data, then a buffer overflow cannot be executed on that system. However, if the program
does not check the boundaries of variables and arrays, and allows excess data to be loaded, then that
system is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
ptg999
Spyware 101
The Sasser Virus/Buffer Overflow
This is an older attack, but one that demonstrates the use of a buffer-overflow attack. Sasser is a combi-
nation attack in that the virus (or worm) spreads by exploiting a buffer overrun.
The Sasser virus spreads by exploiting a known flaw in a Windows system program. Sasser copies
itself to the Windows directory as avserve.exe and creates a Registry key to load itself at startup. In that
way, once your machine is infected, you will start the virus every time you start the machine. This virus
scans random IP addresses, listening on successive TCP ports starting at 1068 for exploitable
systems—that is, systems that have not been patched to fix this flaw. When one is found, the worm
exploits the vulnerable system by overflowing a buffer in LSASS.EXE, which is a file that is part of the
Windows operating system. That executable is a built-in system file and is part of Windows. Sasser
also acts as an FTP server on TCP port 5554, and it creates a remote shell on TCP port 9996. Next,
Sasser creates an FTP script named cmd.ftp on the remote host and executes that script. This FTP script
instructs the target victim to download and execute the worm from the infected host. The infected host
accepts this FTP traffic on TCP port 5554. The computer also creates a file named win.log on the C:
drive. This file contains the IP address of the localhost. Copies of the virus are created in the Windows
System directory as #_up.exe. Examples are shown here:
■ c:\WINDOWS\system32\12553_up.exe
■ c:\WINDOWS\system32\17923_up.exe
■ c:\WINDOWS\system32\29679_up.exe
A side effect of this virus is that it causes your machine to reboot. A machine that is repeatedly
rebooting without any other known cause may well be infected with the Sasser virus. 
This is another case in which the infection can easily be prevented by several means. First, if you
update your systems on a regular basis, your systems should not be vulnerable to this flaw. Second, if
your network’s routers or firewall block traffic on the ports mentioned (9996 and 5554), you will then
prevent most of Sasser’s damage. Your firewall should only allow in traffic on specified ports; all other
ports should be shut down. In short, if you as the network administrator are aware of security issues
and are taking prudent steps to protect the network, your network will be safe. The fact that so many
networks were affected by this virus should indicate that not enough administrators are properly
trained in computer security.
Spyware
In Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Security,” spyware was mentioned as one of the threats to
computer security. Using spyware, however, requires a great deal more technical knowledge on the part
of the perpetrator than some other forms of malware. The perpetrator must be able to develop spyware
for the particular situation or customize existing spyware for his needs. He must then be able to get the
spyware on the target machine.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware102
Spyware can be as simple as a cookie used by a website to record a few brief facts about your visit to that
website, or spyware could be of a more insidious type, such as a key logger. Recall from Chapter 1 that key
loggers are programs that record every keystroke you make on your keyboard; this spyware then logs your
keystrokes to the spy’s file. The most common use of a key logger is to capture usernames and passwords.
However, this method can capture every username and password you enter and every document you type,
as well as anything else you might type. This data can be stored in a small file hidden on your machine for
later extraction or sent out in TCP packets to some predetermined address. In some cases, the software is
even set to wait until after hours to upload this data to some server or to use your own email software to
send the data to an anonymous email address. There are also some key loggers that take periodic screen-
shots from your machine, revealing anything that is open on your computer. Whatever the specific mode of
operation, spyware is software that literally spies on your activities on a particular computer.
Legal Uses of Spyware
There are some perfectly legal uses for spyware. Some employers have embraced such spyware as a
means of monitoring employee use of company technology. Many companies have elected to monitor
phone, email, or web traffic within the organization. Keep in mind that the computer, network, and
phone systems are the property of the company or organization, not of the employee. These tech-
nologies are supposedly only used for work purposes; therefore, company monitoring might not
constitute any invasion of privacy. While courts have upheld this monitoring as a company’s right, it is
critical to consult an attorney before initiating this level of employee monitoring as well as to consider
the potential negative impact on employee morale.
Parents can also elect to use this type of software on their home computer to monitor the activities of
their children on the Internet. The goal is usually a laudable one—protecting their children from online
predators. Yet, as with employees in a company, the practice may illicit a strong negative reaction from
the parties being spied upon (namely, their children). Parents have to weigh the risk to their children
versus what might be viewed as a breach of trust.
How Is Spyware Delivered to a Target System?
Clearly, spyware programs can track all activity on a computer, and that information can be retrieved
by another party via a number of different methods. The real question is this: How does spyware get
onto a computer system in the first place? The most common method is a Trojan horse. It is also
possible that when you visit a certain website spyware may download in the background while you are
simply perusing the website. Of course, if an employer (or parent) is installing the spyware, it can then
be installed non-covertly in the same way that an organization would install any other application.
Obtaining Spyware Software
Given the many other utilities and tools that have been mentioned as available from the Internet, you
probably will not be surprised to learn that you can obtain many spyware products for free, or at very
low cost, on the Internet. You can check the Counterexploitation (www.cexx.org) website, shown in
ptg999
Spyware 103
Figure 5.1, for a lengthy list of known spyware products circulating on the Internet and for information
about methods one can use to remove them. The Spyware Guide website (SpywareGuide, 2004)
(www.spywareguide.com) lists spyware that you can get right off the Internet should you feel some
compelling reason to spy on someone’s computer activities. Figure 5.2 shows the categories of
malware that are available from this site. Several key logger applications are listed on this site, as
shown in Figure 5.3. These applications include well-known key loggers such as Absolute Keylogger,
Tiny Keylogger, and TypO. Most can be downloaded for free or for a nominal charge from the Internet.
FIGURE 5.1 Counterexploitation website.
FIGURE 5.2 Malware categories at the Spyware Guide website.
FIGURE 5.3 List of key loggers available through the Spyware Guide website.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware104
Some well-known Trojan horses are also listed at this site (as shown in Figure 5.4), such as the 2nd
Thought application that downloads to a person’s PC and then blasts it with advertisements. This
particular piece of spyware is one that downloads to your PC when you visit certain websites. It is
benign in that it causes no direct harm to your system or files, nor does it gather sensitive information
from your PC. However, it is incredibly annoying as it inundates your machine with unwanted ads.
This sort of software is often referred to as adware. Frequently, these ads cannot be stopped by normal
protective pop-up blockers because the pop-up windows are not generated by a website that you visit
but rather by some rogue software running on your machine. Pop-up blockers only work to stop sites
you visit from opening new windows. Websites use well-known scripting techniques to cause your
browser to open a window, and pop-up blockers recognize these techniques and prevent the ad window
from opening. However, if the adware launches a new browser instance, it bypasses the pop-up
blocker’s function.
FIGURE 5.4 Trojan horses available at the Spyware Guide website.
Other Forms of Malware
In this and preceding chapters, the most prominent forms of malware have been discussed. There are,
however, many other forms of attack. It is beyond the scope of this book to explore each of these, but
you should be aware of the existence of these other forms of malware. Simply being aware can go a
long way toward enabling you to defend your system efficiently. This section will touch upon just a
few other forms of malware. You should reference the websites discussed in the end of chapter exer-
cises and projects often so that you can stay up-to-date with all current forms of attack and defenses.
Rootkit
A rootkit is a collection of tools that a hacker uses to mask her intrusion and obtain administrator-level
access to a computer or computer network. The intruder installs a rootkit on a computer after first
obtaining user-level access, either by exploiting a known vulnerability or cracking a password. The
rootkit then collects user IDs and passwords to other machines on the network, thus giving the hacker
root or privileged access. 
ptg999
Other Forms of Malware 105
A rootkit may consist of utilities that also
■ Monitor traffic and keystrokes
■ Create a “back door” into the system for the hacker’s use
■ Alter log files
■ Attack other machines on the network
■ Alter existing system tools to circumvent detection
The presence of a rootkit on a network was first documented in the early 1990s. At that time, Sun and
Linux operating systems were the primary targets for a hacker looking to install a rootkit. Today,
rootkits are available for a number of operating systems and are increasingly difficult to detect on any
network (searchSecurity.com, 2004b).
Malicious Web-Based Code
A malicious web-based code, also known as a web-based mobile code, simply refers to a code that is
portable to all operating systems or platforms such as HTTP, Java, and so on. The “malicious” part
implies that is it a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or some other form of malware. Simply put, the malicious
code does not care what the operating system may be or what browser is in use. It infects them all
blindly (Yakabovicz, 2003).
Where do these codes come from, and how are they spread? The first generation of the Internet was
mostly indexed text files. However, as the Internet has grown into a graphical, multimedia user expe-
rience, programmers have created scripting languages and new application technologies to enable a
more interactive experience. As with any new technology, programs written with scripting languages
run the gamut from useful to poorly crafted to outright dangerous. 
Technologies such as Java and ActiveX enable these buggy or untrustworthy programs to move to and
execute on user workstations. (Other technologies that can enable malicious code are executables,
JavaScript, Visual Basic Script, and plug-ins.) The Web acts to increase the mobility of code without
differentiating between program quality, integrity, or reliability. Using available tools, it is quite simple
to “drag and drop” code into documents that are subsequently placed on web servers and made
available to employees throughout the organization or individuals across the Internet. If this code is
maliciously programmed or just improperly tested, it can cause serious damage. 
Not surprisingly, hackers have used these very useful tools to steal, alter, and erase data files as well as
gain unauthorized access to corporate networks. A malicious code attack can penetrate corporate
networks and systems from a variety of access points, including websites, HTML content in email
messages, or corporate intranets. Figure 5.5 shows the rapid growth of mobile malicious code in recent
years versus viruses.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware106
FIGURE 5.5 Growth of mobile malicious code.
Today, with literally billions of Internet users, new malicious code attacks can spread almost instantly
through corporations. The majority of damage caused by malicious code happens in the first hours
after a first-strike attack occurs—before there is time for countermeasures. The costs of network
downtime or theft of IP make malicious code a top priority (finjan software, 2004).
Logic Bombs
A logic bomb is a type of malware that executes its malicious purpose when a specific criteria is met.
The most common factor is date/time. For example a logic bomb might delete files on a certain
date/time. An example is the case of Roger Duronio. In June 2006, Roger Duronio, a system adminis-
trator for UBS, was charged with using a logic bomb to damage the company’s computer network. His
plan was to drive the company stock down due to damage from the logic bomb and so he was charged
with securities fraud. Duronio was later convicted and sentenced to 8 years and 1 month in prison and
ordered to pay $3.1 million restitution to UBS.
Spam
Spam is something most readers are probably familiar with. It is unwanted email. Spam is email that is
sent out to multiple parties, that is unsolicited. Often it is used for marketing purposes, but it can be
used for much more malicious goals. For example, spam is a common way to spread a virus or worm.
Spam is also used to send emails enticing recipients to visit phishing websites in order to steal the
recipient’s identity. Essentially, spam is, at best, an annoyance and, at worst, a vehicle for spyware,
viruses, worms, and phishing attacks.
ptg999
Detecting and Eliminating Viruses and Spyware 107
Detecting and Eliminating Viruses and Spyware
Antivirus Software
In this chapter, and throughout this book, the need for running virus–scanning software has been
discussed. It is prudent at this point to provide you with some details on how virus scanners work and
information on the major virus-scanning software packages. This information should help you better
understand how a virus scanner might help protect your system and help you make intelligent deci-
sions regarding the purchase and deployment of some antivirus solution.
A virus scanner can work in one of two ways. The first is to look for a signature (or pattern) that
matches a known virus. This is why it is important to keep your virus software updated so that you have
the most recent list of signatures with which to work.
The other way in which a virus scanner might check a given PC is to look at the behavior of an
executable. If that program behaves in a way consistent with virus activity, the virus scanner may flag
it as a virus. Such activity could include the following:
■ Attempting to copy itself
■ Attempting to access the address book of the system’s email program
■ Attempting to change Registry settings in Windows
Figure 5.6 shows the Norton AntiVirus software in action. You can see that the virus definitions are up-
to-date, that the virus scanning is enabled, auto-protection is enabled, and the Internet worm protection
is enabled as well. The other popular virus scanners have many of the same features.
FIGURE 5.6 Norton AntiVirus interface.
ptg999
CHAPTER 5 Malware108
Most antivirus software today offer additional features. Some of these features include warning the
user of known phishing websites, detecting spyware as well as viruses, and even detecting likely
phishing attempts. Any modern antivirus should be a comprehensive package, protecting against a
variety of attacks, rather than just stopping viruses.
Antispyware Software
Fortunately, just as there are many different spyware applications available, there are likewise many
different software applications on the market that are designed specifically to detect and remove
spyware. These applications are also usually available at extremely low cost. You can often get a free
trial version to use for a limited time so that you can make a more intelligent purchasing decision. Of
course, the most prudent course of action you can take to avoid getting spyware on your machine is to
never download anything from the Internet that does not come from a very well-known and trusted
website. However, in an organizational environment, you cannot simply rely on your employees to do
the right thing. It is prudent as the company’s computer security expert to take steps yourself to prevent
the employees from compromising your system security. 
Some of the better known and more widely used antispyware applications include Spy Sweeper from
www.webroot.com, Zero Spyware Removal from www.zerospyware.com, and Spector Pro from
www.spectorsoft.com. All of these applications can be obtained for anywhere from $20 to $50, and many
offer a free trial version. And most modern antivirus software either includes antispyware, or it can be
added as an option.
Figure 5.7 shows the items found by running the WebRoot Spy Sweeper software on a system. These
items can be selected for quarantine and removal.
FIGURE 5.7 Items recommended for removal by Spy Sweeper.

number of files scanned, the number of items removed, the date the full sweep was performed, as well
as additional information is all detailed on this summary page. Each of the antispyware applications
would provide similar results and each contain similar options for sweeping a system.

CHAPTER 5 Malware110
Summary
Clearly, there are a number of ways to attack a target system: by denial of service, virus/worm, Trojan
horse, buffer-overflow attacks, and spyware. Each type of attack comes in many distinct variations. It
should be obvious by this point that securing your system is absolutely critical. In the upcoming exer-
cises, you will try out the antivirus programs by Norton and McAfee. There are so many ways for a
hacker to attack a system that securing your system can be a rather complex task. 
Another theme that is driven home throughout this chapter is that many, if not most, attacks are
preventable. The exercises ahead will give you practice in figuring out how to prevent the Sasser and
Sobig virus. In most cases, prompt and regular patching of the system, use of antivirus tools, and
blocking unneeded ports would prevent the attack. The fact that so many systems do get infected is an
indication of the very real problem of network professionals who are not skilled in computer security.

However, you should not simply copy their antivirus policies. Rather, you should come up with your own.
PROJECT 5.2: The Worst Virus Attacks
Using resources on the Web, books, or journals, find a virus outbreak that you consider to have been
the worst in history. Write a brief paper describing this attack, and explain why you think it is the
worst. Was it widely spread? How quickly did it spread? What damage did it do?
PROJECT 5.3: Why Write a Virus?
A number of hypotheses have been formed regarding why people write a virus. These hypotheses range
from the frankly conspiratorial to the academically psychological. Taking whatever position you feel is
most likely, write a paper explaining why you think people take the time and effort to write a virus.
Case Study
Chiao Chien manages IT security for a school. Given the wide range of people who use the school’s
computers, it is difficult for Chien to prevent virus attacks. Chien has a reasonably good budget
and has installed antivirus software on every machine. He also has a firewall that has all unneeded
ports blocked, and there is a school policy prohibiting the downloading of any software from the
Web. Consider the following questions:
■ How secure do you think Chien’s network is from virus attacks?
■ What areas has Chien not secured?
■ What recommendations would you make to Chien?

Techniques Used by Hackers
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Understand the basic methodology used by hackers
■ Be familiar with some of the basic tools 
■ Understand the hacking mentality 
Introduction
In the preceding five chapters, we have explored computer security and various security breaches. In
this chapter we will be exploring the techniques that hackers use to commit computer crimes. Before
we go any further, it is important that you realize that many hackers are not criminals. A hacker is a
person who wants to understand a system, often by probing its weaknesses. There are even hackers that
work for organizations, testing the organization’s system security. This is called penetration testing.
This is also often referred to as white hat hacking. The EC Council (www.eccouncil.org) even has a
certification for this, the Certified Ethical Hacker. Then there are hobbyists, who simply like to probe
systems, learning about them. There is a magazine for such people called 2600 (www.2600.com).
However, there are people who use hacking techniques to breach systems to steal data, damage
systems, or commit other cyber crimes. These people are usually referred to as black hat hackers or
crackers.
The techniques presented in this chapter are not only presented to give the reader an understanding of
how black hat hackers work, but also provide a method whereby a network administrator can perform a
penetration test on his or her own network. By attempting some of these techniques on your network,
you can assess your vulnerability. It should be pointed out that you should only do this once you are very
comfortable with the techniques in this chapter, and only with permission from senior management.

The Reconnaissance Phase 117
Basic Terminology
Before we can delve into the world of hacking, we need to discuss the basic terminology used in this
community. We have already introduced you to the term white hat hacker, one who uses hacking tech-
niques for legal/ethical purposes. And we have discussed the term black hat hacker or cracker, one who
uses hacking techniques for illegal techniques.
There are a few other terms you should be familiar with. A gray hat hacker is one who was previously
a black hat hacker and turned into a white hat hacker (basically, a former criminal now turned ethical).
With the proliferation of tools on the Internet, there are also a lot of people who download some tools
(we will examine some of these in this chapter) and perform some cyber attack, without really under-
standing it. These people are termed script kiddies (also sometimes spelled kiddy’s). Another important
term is phreaking. This refers to hacking into phone systems. Hacking of phone systems actually pre-
dates hacking computer systems.
The Reconnaissance Phase
Any intelligent/experienced hacker is going to first attempt to find out information about a target
before actually attempting an attack. Just as a bank robber would want to know about a bank’s alarm
systems, number of guards, police response time, etc., a black hat hacker will want to know about your
systems security. What may surprise you is how much information can be found easily on the Internet,
without even attaching to the target system.
Passive Scanning Techniques
One of the easiest things one can do is check the target organization’s websites. It is common for busi-
nesses to put information up that can be very useful to an attacker. For example, let’s assume company
XYZ lists John Doe as their IT manager. An enterprising hacker scans bulletin boards and discussion
groups for references to John Doe at XYZ. That attacker might find information useful in spear
phishing attacks (phishing targeted at a specific individual or group of individuals), or the attacker
might find information useful in social engineering. For example, a number of former employees
complain that John Doe is demanding and quick to fire people. Then, an enterprising hacker could call
someone at XYZ claiming to be working for John Doe. The hacker claims he is trying to log on
remotely to that person’s computer to update that person’s system. After a few moments, the hacker
tells the person he forgot the password John Doe gave him and is very concerned he will get fired if he
doesn’t complete this assignment; then he asks that person for his or her password. The information the
attacker gleaned from the Web gave him enough information to make this social engineering attack
plausible.
It is also possible for an attacker to scan bulletin boards, chat rooms, discussion groups, etc. looking for
questions from IT staff at the target organization. For example, if an administrator posts in a discussion
group asking about a particular server problem, this can give the attacker valuable information about
that target network.
ptg999
CHAPTER 6 Techniques Used by Hackers118
Another way attackers can use the Web to find out information about a target is through job ads. For
example if a company routinely advertises for ASP.Net developers, and never for PHP, Pearl, etc., then
it is likely that their web applications are developed with ASP.Net running on a Windows web server
(Internet Information Services). This can allow the attacker to focus only on a small group of possible
attacks (those against ASP.Net/Windows). Other information can be garnered from job ads. For
example, if a small company, less than 200 employees, has an advertisement for a network adminis-
trator twice a year, it is more likely that the last administrator is no longer with them. A small company
would not need multiple administrators. Knowing the current administrator is new means he or she is
not as familiar with their own systems. Also if this trend of advertising for new administrators extends
over a couple of years, it means the company has high turnover and there is some problem the attacker
may be able to exploit.
There are also specific websites that provide information that an attacker may find useful. The first
such website is netcraft.com, shown in Figure 6.1. This website provides information about websites.
For example, you can find out what kind of server a site is running, and in some cases how long it has
been since it was last rebooted.
FIGURE 6.1 www.Netcraft.com.
Another site that can be useful for attackers is www.archive.org. This site, shown in Figure 6.2,
archives older versions of websites. The server scours the web archiving sites. The frequency with
which a site is archived depends on its popularity.
Active Scanning Techniques
The previously mentioned techniques are all considered passive, as they do not require the attacker to
connect to the target system. Since the attacker is not actually connecting to the target system, it is
impossible for an intrusion-detection system (IDS) to detect the scan. Active scans are far more
reliable, but may be detected by the target system. There are a few types of active scans.
ptg999
The Reconnaissance Phase 119
FIGURE 6.2 www.archive.org.
Port Scanning
Port scanning is the process of attempting to contact each network port on the target system and see
which ones are open. There are 1,024 well-known ports that are usually associated with specific
services. For example port 161 is associated with simple network management protocol. If an attacker
detects port 161 open on the target system, he or she might decide to try SNMP-related attacks. Even
more information can be derived from a port scan. For example, ports 137, 138, and 139 are all asso-
ciated with NetBIOS, a very old Windows method of network communication, not used in Windows
anymore. However NetBIOS is often used for systems where Windows machines need to communicate
with Linux machines. So discovering those ports open reveals something about the target network.
A simple Google search for “port scanner” will reveal a host of well-known, widely used, and often
free port scanners. However, the most popular port scanner in the hacking and security community is
the free tool Nmap (http://nmap.org/). There is a Windows version of it, shown in Figure 6.3.
Nmap allows you to customize your scan making it more or less stealthy, and targeting certain systems.
The most common types of scans are listed here:
■ Ping scan: This scan simply sends a ping to the target port. Many network administrators block
incoming ICMP packets for the purpose of stopping ping scans.
■ Connect scan: This is the most reliable scan, but also the most likely to be detected. With this
type of scan a complete connection is made with the target system.
ptg999
CHAPTER 6 Techniques Used by Hackers120
■ SYN scan: This scan is very stealthy. Most systems accept SYN (Synchronize) requests. This
scan is similar to the SYN flood DoS attack described in Chapter 4, “Denial of Service
Attacks.” In this scan you send a SYN packet, but never respond when the system sends a
SYN/ACK. However, unlike the DoS SYN flood, you only send one packet per port. This is
also called the half-open scan.
■ FIN scan: This scan has the FIN flag, or connection finished flag set. This is also not an un-
usual packet for systems to receive, so is considered stealthy.
FIGURE 6.3 Nmap GUI
Each of these scans provokes a different response on the target machine and thus provides different
information to the port scanner:
■ With a FIN Scan or an XMAS scan if the target port is closed the system sends back an RST
flag packet (RST means reset). If it is open there is no response.
■ With a SYN scan, if the port is closed, the response is an RST; if it is open, the response is a
SYN/ACK.
■ ACK scans and NULL scans only work on UNIX systems. 
Nmap also lets you set a number of flags (either with the command-line version of Nmap or the
Windows version). These customize your scan. The allowed flags are listed here:
ptg999
The Reconnaissance Phase 121
-O Detects operating system
-sP Is a ping scan
-sT TCP connect scan
-sS SYN scan
-sF FIN scan
-sX Xmas tree scan
-sN NULL scan
-sU UDP scan
-sO Protocol scan
-sA ACK scan
-sW Windows scan
-sR RPC scan
-sL List/DNS scan
-sI Idle scan
-Po Don’t ping
-PT TCP ping
-PS SYN ping
-PI ICMP ping
-PB TCP and ICMP ping
-PM ICMP netmask
-oN Normal output
-oX XML output
-oG Greppable output
-oA All output
-T Timing
-T0 paranoid
-T 1 Sneaking
-T 2 Polite
-T 3 Normal
-T 4 Aggressive
-T 5 Insane
As you can see there are a number of options available to an attacker using Nmap. One can spend a lot
of time just learning Nmap. There are, of course, a number of other port scanning tools. We have
focused on Nmap because it is free and it is so widely used. It also is prominently figured on the EC
Council Certified Ethical Hacker certification.
Vulnerability Assessment
Vulnerability assessment is checking a system to see if it is vulnerable to specific attacks. These tools
can be used by attackers to assess your system; however, they are designed to allow you to assess your
ptg999
CHAPTER 6 Techniques Used by Hackers122
system. These tools are not particularly stealthy and thus will probably be detected by an intrusion-
detection system. In fact, vulnerability assessment tools are commonly used by network administrators
to test their own networks. These tools will be covered in Chapter 11, “Network Scanning and Vulner-
ability Scanning.”
Enumeration
Another technique that is popular before the actual attack is enumeration. Enumeration is simply the
process of finding out what is on the target system. If the target is an entire network, then the attacker
is trying to find out what servers, computers, and printers are on that network. If the target is a specific
computer, then the attacker is trying to find out what users and shared folders exist on that system.
A simple Google search will help you find a number of enumeration tools. One of the easiest to use is
Cain and Abel, shown in Figure 6.4. 
FIGURE 6.4 Cain and Abel.
Cain and Abel can do a lot more than just enumeration, but for our purposes that is what we are
focusing on here. For enumeration, simply click on the Network tab and you will find all machines
connected to the network you are on. This obviously requires some level of access before you can
enumerate the target network.
A few other enumeration tools that are popular with hackers and can easily be found on the Internet are
■ Sid2User
■ Cheops (Linux only)
■ UserInfo
■ UserDump
■ DumpSec
■ Netcat
■ NBTDump
ptg999
Actual Attacks 123
This is not an exhaustive list, but it includes some of the most widely used enumeration tools.
To defend against scanning you should use the following techniques:
■ Be careful how much information you put on the Internet about your organization and its network.
■ Make it a company policy that technical personnel who use bulletin boards, chat rooms, etc. for
technical data must not use their real name or reveal the company’s name.
■ Use an IDS that detects many scans.
■ Block incoming Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets.
These won’t make scanning and reconnaissance impossible on your system, but they will make certain
the attacker gathers significantly less information.
Actual Attacks
Now that we have discussed how attackers scan a target system, let’s look at a few attacks that are
commonly used. Obviously this won’t be an exhaustive list, but it will provide you some insight into
the attack methodologies used. In Chapter 4 we discussed denial of service attacks and some tools used
to cause these attacks. In this section we will look at other sorts of attacks and the techniques and tools
used to make them happen.
SQL Script Injection
This may be the most popular attack on websites. In recent years, more websites have taken steps to
ameliorate the dangers of this attack, but my informal surveys still find about one-third of websites
susceptible. This attack is based on passing structured query language commands to a web application
and getting the website to execute them. 
The way the most basic SQL injection works is this. Many websites/applications have a page where
users enter their username and password. That username and password will have to be checked against
some database to see if they are valid. Regardless of the type of database (Oracle, SQL Server,
MySQL, etc.), all databases speak Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL looks and functions a great
deal like English. For example, to check a username and password you might want to query the
database and see if there is any entry in the users table that matches that username and password that
was entered. If there is, then you have a match. The SQL statement might look something like this:
‘SELECT * FROM tblUsers WHERE USERNAME = ‘jdoe’ AND PASSWORD = ‘letmein’
The problem with this, while it is valid SQL, is that we have hard coded the username and password.
For a real website we would have to take whatever the user entered into the username field and
password field and check that. This can be easily done (regardless of what programming or scripting
language the website is programmed in). It would look something like this:
‘SELECT * FROM tblUsers WHERE USERNAME = ‘” + txtUsername.Text +’ AND PASSWORD = ‘”
+ txtPassword.Text +”’” . 
ptg999
CHAPTER 6 Techniques Used by Hackers124
If you enter username ‘jdoe’ and password ‘letmein’, this code produces the following SQL
command:
SELECT * FROM tblUsers WHERE USERNAME = ‘jdoe’ AND PASSWORD = ‘letmein’
Now if there is a username jdoe in tblUsers, and the password for it is letmein, then this user will be
logged on. If not, then an error will occur.
SQL injection works by putting in some SQL into the username and password block that is always
true. For example, suppose you enter ‘OR X=X’ into the username and password boxes. This will
cause the program to create this query:
SELECT * FROM tblUsers WHERE USERNAME = ‘’OR X=X’ AND PASSWORD = ‘’OR X=X’
Notice we start with a single quotation mark (‘) before the OR X=X. This is to close the open quote the
attacker knows must be in the code. And if you see ‘’, that essentially is a blank or null. So what we
are telling the database is to log us in if the username is blank, or if X=X, and if the password is blank,
or if X=X. If you think about this for a second, you will see that X always equals x, so this will always
be true.
There is no significance to ‘OR X=X’; it is simply a statement that will always be true. Attackers try
other similar statements, such as the following:
‘ or ‘a’ =’a
‘ or ‘1’ =‘1
’ or (1=1)
This is only one example of SQL injection; there are other methods, but this is the most common. The
defense against this attack is to filter all user input before processing it. This is often referred to as input
validation. This prevents an attacker from entering SQL commands rather than a username and
password. Unfortunately, many sites do not filter user input and are still vulnerable to this attack.
Cross-Site Scripting
With cross-site scripting, an attacker injects client-side script into web pages viewed by other users. The
key is that the attacker enters scripts into an area that other users interact with. So that when they go to
that part of the site the attacker’s script is executed, rather than the intended website functionality. For
example, assume a shopping site allows users to review products. Rather than typing in a review, the
attacker types in JavaScript that redirects the user to a phishing website. When another user views that
“review,” the script will execute and take them to the new site. Again, this can be prevented by simply
filtering all user input. As of this writing, all the major online shopping portals, such as Amazon.com, do
filter input and are not susceptible to this attack. However, many smaller sites are still susceptible. 
This attack, as well as SQL injection, illustrate why it is critical that all IT personnel be familiar with
security, not just security administrators. If more web developers were more familiar with security,
these two attacks would not be widespread.
ptg999
Actual Attacks 125
Password Cracking
Doing password cracking is easiest when one can actually get physical access to a machine. This is not
as difficult as it sounds. Many organizations (such as universities) have kiosk machines were one can
use the system with minimal/guest privileges. A skilled hacker can use this access to gain further
access.
OphCrack
A very popular tool for cracking Windows passwords is OphCrack. OphCrack can be downloaded
from http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net. It is based on an understanding of how Windows passwords
work. Windows passwords are stored in a hash file in one of the system directories, usually
C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\ in a SAM file. SAM is an acronym for Security Accounts Manager.
The passwords are stored as a hash. (Hashes will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8, “Encryption.”)
What Windows does is hash the password you type in and compare it to the hash found in the SAM
file. If there is a match, then you are logged in. Now to prevent someone from copying the SAM file
and taking it off to try to brute force it, as soon as Windows begins the boot process, the SAM file is
locked by the operating system. What OphCrack does is to boot to Linux and then get the SAM file and
look up the hashed passwords in a large table of hashed values it has, looking for a match. If it finds
one, then the matching text in that table of hashed values is the password. You can see OphCrack in
Figure 6.5.
FIGURE 6.5 OphCrack.
ptg999
CHAPTER 6 Techniques Used by Hackers126
This tool is remarkably easy to use. Just put the OphCrack CD into the machine, reboot. During the
boot process you can press F12 for a boot menu and tell the system to boot from CD. You will then start
OphCrack. It should be noted that longer passwords (as of this writing longer than 10 characters) are
usually not crackable by OphCrack.
Now assuming OphCrack is successful (it isn’t always), what can the attacker do with this? At best he
or she simply got the local machine admin account, and not a domain account. Well, this can be used to
then gain domain access. One simple technique is to create a script that will in turn create a domain
admin account. The script is simple:
net user /domain /add localaccountname password
net group /domain “Domain Admins” /add localaccount
Now obviously if the attacker executes this script it will not work. One must be a domain admin for it
to work. So the attacker saves this script to the all users startup folder. The next time a domain admin
logs on to this system, the script will successfully execute. But the attacker may not want to wait until
that happens. So in order to speed up the process, the attacker causes some minor problem in the
system (changes settings, alters configuration, etc.). In many organizations, the tech support personnel
are in the domain admins group. When a tech support person logs on to the system to correct the
problem, the script will successfully run.

Summary
In this chapter we have examined just a few techniques hackers utilize. But these techniques and tools
have illustrated the need for a variety of security measures. The scanning techniques illustrate the need
for blocking certain traffic at the firewall and for running an IDS. The SQL injection attack demon-
strates why security must be a part of application development. And the OphCrack tool illustrates why
physical security is important and why the principle of least privileges is important. Putting tech
support staff into the domain admins group violates the concept of least privileges and makes the priv-
ilege escalation script possible.

Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Know what is meant by industrial espionage
■ Understand the low-technology methods used to attempt industrial espionage
■ Be aware of how spyware is used in espionage
■ Know how to protect a system from espionage
Introduction
When you hear the word espionage, perhaps you conjure up a number of exciting and glamorous images.
Perhaps you have visions of a well-dressed man who drinks martinis, shaken but not stirred, traveling to
glamorous locations with equally glamorous travel companions. Or perhaps you envision some exciting
covert operation with high-speed car chases and guns blazing in faraway exotic lands. Contrary to popular
media portrayals, espionage is often much less exciting than those visions. The ultimate goal of espionage
is to obtain information that would not otherwise be made available. Generally, espionage is best done with
as little fanfare as possible. Blazing gun battles and glamorous locations tend to be the antithesis of intelli-
gence gathering. Rather, information is the goal. If possible, it is best to obtain that information without the
target organization even realizing that its information has been compromised.
Many people assume that such spying is only engaged in by governments, intelligence agencies, and
nefarious international organizations, such as Al Qaida. While those entities do indeed engage in espi-
onage, they are certainly not the only organizations that do so. The aforementioned organizations desire
to acquire information for political and military goals. However, economic goals are also dependent on
accurate and often sensitive data. With billions of dollars at stake, private companies can become
engaged in industrial espionage as either a target or a perpetrator. What company would not like to know
exactly what its competitor is doing? In fact, corporate or economic espionage is on the rise.
Chapter 7
132
ptg999
What Is Industrial Espionage? 133
Corporate or economic espionage is a growing problem, but it can be difficult to accurately assess just
how great a problem it is. Companies that perpetrate corporate espionage do not share the fact that they
do it, for obvious reasons. Companies that are victims of such espionage often do not wish to reveal
that fact, either. Revealing that their security was compromised could have a negative impact on their
stock value. It is also possible, in certain cases, that such a breach of security might open the company
to liability claims from customers whose data may have been compromised. For these reasons,
companies often are hesitant to disclose any industrial espionage activities. Because you will want to
protect yourself and your company, it is important that you learn about espionage methods and protec-
tions. In the exercises at the end of this chapter, you will run antispyware, key loggers, and screen-
capture software so that you are aware of how they work and, hence, will be cognizant of the risks they
pose. While we did cover those in previous chapters, we will expand on that in this chapter’s exercises.
What Is Industrial Espionage?
Industrial espionage is simply the use of spying techniques to find out key information that is of
economic value. Such data might include details on a competitor’s new project, a list of a competitor’s
clients, research data, or any information that might give the spying organization an economic
advantage. While the rationale for corporate espionage is different from military espionage, corporate
techniques are often the same as those methods employed by intelligence agencies and can include
electronic monitoring, photocopying files, or compromising a member of the target organization. Not
only does economic espionage use the same techniques as intelligence agencies, but it often also uses
the same people. There have been a number of incidents in which former intelligence agents were
found working in corporate espionage. When such individuals bring their skills and training to the
world of corporate espionage, the situation becomes much more difficult for computer security experts. 
In Practice
Leaving with Sensitive Data
While various computer experts and government agencies attempt to estimate the impact and spread
of corporate espionage, its very nature makes accurate estimates impossible. Not only do the perpe-
trators not wish to disclose their crimes, but often the victims will not disclose the event, either.
However, anecdotal evidence would suggest that the most common form of espionage is simply an
employee who quits, takes a job with another firm, and leaves with sensitive data. In many cases,
these employees choose data that is readily available within the company and, as such, the data is
considered a “gray area” as to its confidentiality. For example, a salesperson may leave with a printout
of contacts and customers so that he can solicit them on behalf of the next employer. It is critical that
you have a very well-worded nondisclosure and noncompete agreement with all employees. It is best
to solicit the services of an employment attorney to draw up this agreement. Additionally, you might
consider limiting an employee’s access to data prior to terminating his or her employment. You should
also conduct exit interviews and consider confiscating items such as company phonebooks, which
may at first seem insignificant but which could contain data useful to another company. It is also the
case that thumb drives, smart phones, and other technologies provide a method for taking data out of
a company. Some companies restrict the use of these devices.

CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace134
Information as an Asset
Many people are used to viewing tangible objects as assets but have difficulty appreciating how mere
information can be a real asset. Companies spend billions of dollars every year on research and devel-
opment. The discovered information is worth at least the amount of resources taken to derive the infor-
mation plus the economic gain produced by the information. For example, if a company spends
$200,000 researching a process that will in turn generate $1 million in revenue, then that data is worth
at least $1.2 million. You can think of this economic gain as a simple equation:
VI (value of information) = C (cost to produce) + VG (value gained)
While some people are not yet fully cognizant of the concept, data does indeed represent a valuable asset.
When we speak of the “information age” or our “information-based economy,” it is important to realize
that these terms are not just buzzwords. Information is a real commodity. It is as much an economic asset
as any other item in the company’s possession. In fact, it is most often the case that the data residing on a
company’s computer is worth far more than the hardware and software of the computer system itself. It is
certainly the case that the data is much more difficult to replace than the computer hardware and software.
To help you truly appreciate the concept of information as a commodity, consider the process of
earning a college degree. You spend four years sitting in various classrooms. You pay a significant
amount of money for the privilege of sitting in a room and listening to someone speak at length on
some topic. At the end of the four years, the only tangible product you receive is a single piece of paper.
Surely you can get a piece of paper for far less cost and with much less effort. What you actually paid
for was the information you received. The same is true of the value of many professions. Doctors,
attorneys, engineers, consultants, managers, and so forth all are consulted for their expert information.
Information itself is the valuable commodity.
The data stored in computer systems has a high value for two reasons. First, there is a great deal of time
and effort that goes into creating and analyzing the data. If you spend six months with a team of five
people gathering and analyzing information, then that information is worth at least an amount equal to
the salaries and benefits of those people for that length of time. Second, data often has intrinsic value,
apart from the time and effort spent acquiring those facts. If the facts are about a proprietary process,
invention, or algorithm, its value is obvious. However, any data that might provide a competitive edge
is inherently valuable. For example, insurance companies frequently employ teams of statisticians and
actuaries who use the latest technology to try to predict the risks associated with any given group of
potential insureds. The resulting statistical information might be quite valuable to a competing
insurance company. Even a customer contact list has a certain inherent value.
Thus, as you work in the computer security field, always keep in mind that any data that might have
economic value is an asset to your organization and that such data provides an attractive target for any
competitors who may not have ethical inhibitions against using espionage. If your company
management thinks that this threat is not real, then they are very much mistaken. Any company is a
potential victim of corporate espionage. You should take steps to protect your valuable information—
and the first critical step in this process is asset identification.
ptg999
Information as an Asset 135
Asset identification is the process of listing the assets that you believe support your organization. This
list should include things that impact direct day-to-day operations as well as those that are tied to your
company’s services or products. The CERT website (www.cert.org/archive/pdf/tutorial-workbook.pdf)
offers a very useful worksheet that you can use to itemize the assets in your organization. This
workbook also offers a number of other useful worksheets for assuring information security within
your organization. As the table of contents in Figure 7.1 shows, this workbook is also a tutorial that
steps you through all the information security considerations.
FIGURE 7.1 Table of contents from the CERT Information Assurance on Small Organizations
workbook.
Table 7.1 is a variation on the worksheet provided by CERT. Armed with this table and based on your
knowledge and experience with the company, you can complete your asset identification following the
steps outlined below.
ptg999
CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace136
TABLE 7.1 Asset Identification Worksheet
Information Systems Services and Applications Other Assets
1. In the first column of the table, list the information assets. You should list the types of informa-
tion used by people in your company—the information people need to do their jobs. Examples
are product designs, software programs, system designs, documentation, customer orders, and
personnel data.
2. For each entry in the Information column, fill in the names of the systems on which the infor-
mation resides. In each case, ask yourself which systems people need to perform their jobs.
3. For each entry in the Information column, fill in the names of the related applications and
services. In each case, ask yourself what applications or services are needed for individuals to
perform their jobs.
4. In the last column, list any other assets that may or may not be directly related to the other three
columns. Examples are databases with customer information, systems used in production, word
processors used to produce documentation, compilers used by programmers, and human re-
sources systems.
Once you complete the proceeding steps and fill out the Asset Identification worksheet, you will have
a good understanding of the critical assets for your organization. With this information, you will know
how best to devote your defensive efforts. Some specific protective steps will be examined later in this
chapter.
Real-World Examples of Industrial Espionage
Now that you have been introduced to the concept of corporate espionage, let’s look at five actual
cases. These case studies are of real-world espionage found in various news sources. This section
should give you an idea of what types of espionage activities actually occur. Note that while some of
these cases are a bit old, they do illustrate the way industrial espionage is done. And it is frequently the
case that details of an industrial espionage incident do not emerge until many years later, if at all.
ptg999
Real-World Examples of Industrial Espionage 137
Example 1: VIA Technology
VIA Technology actually provides two examples of industrial espionage. In the first instance, the chief
executive officer (CEO) of the firm, which was based in Taipei, was indicted for copyright
infringement for allegedly stealing technology from one of his own customers, a networking company
called D-Link (Network World Fusion, 2003).
According to the allegations, VIA engineer Jeremy Chang left VIA to work for D-Link. For several
months while at D-Link, Chang continued to receive a paycheck from VIA. Then he promptly resigned
from D-Link and returned to VIA. Once Chang rejoined VIA, a D-Link document that detailed one of
their simulation programs for testing integrated circuits was posted to an FTP server owned by VIA.
The prosecutors allege that Chang continued to receive a check from VIA because he had never really
resigned. They allege that Chang was in fact a “plant” sent to D-Link to acquire D-Link’s technology
for VIA. VIA maintains that his continuation to receive a check was simply an oversight, and Chang
denies that he posted the document in question. Whatever the truth of the case, it should make any
employer think twice about hiring decisions and nondisclosure agreements.
To make matters worse for VIA, another company accused VIA of stealing code for its optical readers.
In both cases, the story of the possible theft of technology alone has had a negative impact on the stock
value of both companies.
Example 2: General Motors
In 1993, General Motors (GM) and one if its partners began to investigate a former executive, Inaki
Lopez. GM alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM employees had transferred GM proprietary
information to Volkswagen (VW) in Germany via GM’s own network (Brinks et al., 2003). The infor-
mation allegedly stolen included component price data, proprietary construction plans, internal cost
calculations, and a purchasing list.
In 1996, GM followed up the ongoing criminal investigation with civil litigation against Lopez, VW,
and the other employees. In November 1996, GM expanded its legal battle by invoking the various
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statutes, originally intended to be used
against organized crime conspiracies (Economist, 1996). By May 2000, a federal grand jury indicted
Lopez on six counts related to fraud and racketeering. As of this writing, the case is not resolved (USA
Today, 2000). At the time Lopez was indicted, he was residing in Spain and the U.S. Justice
Department was negotiating for his extradition. Thus, you can see that corporate espionage is neither
new nor restricted to technology companies.
Example 3: Interactive Television Technologies, Inc.
On August 13, 1998, someone broke into the computer systems of Interactive Television Technologies,
Inc. and stole the data for a project the company was working on (Secure Telecom, 1998). That project
involved four years of intense research and a substantial financial investment. The product was to be a
way whereby anyone with a television could have Internet access via the Web. This product, code
ptg999
CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace138
named “Butler,” would have been worth a substantial amount to its inventors. However, with all the
research material stolen, it was only a matter of time before several other companies came out with
competing products, thus preventing Interactive Television Technologies from pursuing a patent.
To date, no arrests have been made and no leads are available in this case. This situation was a case of
very skillful hackers breaking into a computer system and taking exactly what they needed. One can
only speculate about their motives. They may well have sold the research data to competitors of Inter-
active Television Technologies, or they may have simply put the data out in the open via the Internet.
Whatever the motives or profits for the perpetrators, the outcome for the victim company was 
catastrophic.
Example 4: Bloomberg, Inc.
According to the American Bar Association Journal (2003), in August 2003, Oleg Zezev, a 29-year-old
PC technician from Kazakhstan, broke into the Bloomberg Inc. computer system and used the alias
Alex to obtain information and then blackmail the firm.
Zezev entered Bloomberg’s computer system and accessed various accounts, including Michael
Bloomberg’s (CEO and founder of Bloomberg L.P.) personal account as well as accounts for other
Bloomberg employees and customers. Zezev copied information from these accounts, including email
inbox screens, Michael Bloomberg’s credit card numbers, and screens relating to the internal functions
of Bloomberg. He also copied internal information that was only accessible by Bloomberg employees.
Zezev then threatened to expose the data he had stolen to the public and, in essence, tell everyone
exactly how he had broken into Bloomberg’s network unless he received $200,000.
After deliberating for less than six hours, the jury in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan found the
perpetrator guilty of all four charges: conspiracy, attempted extortion, sending threatening electronic
messages, and computer intrusion. Although this is not industrial espionage in the classic sense, it does
illustrate the compromising situations in which a company and its employees can be placed when
security is breached.
Example 5: Avant Software
In 1997, executives at Avant Software in Santa Clara County, California, were charged with attempting
to steal secrets from their rival, Cadence Design. The case focused on a former consultant for Avant,
Mitsuru “Mitch” Igusa. After Igusa had taken a job at Cadence, he began emailing files to his home; it
is alleged that he later turned those files over to Avant.
Industrial Espionage and You
These five cases notwithstanding, most companies will deny any involvement in anything that even
hints at espionage. However, not all companies are quite so shy about the issue. Larry Ellison, CEO of
Oracle Corporation, has openly defended his decision to hire private investigators to sift through
ptg999
How Does Espionage Occur? 139
Microsoft garbage in an attempt to garner information (CNET News, 2001). Clearly, espionage is no
longer a problem just for governments and defense contractors. It is a very real concern in the modern
business world. The savvy computer security professional will be aware of this concern and will take
the appropriate proactive steps.
How Does Espionage Occur?
There are two ways that espionage can occur. An easy, low-technology avenue would be for current or
former employees to simply take the data or for someone to use social engineering methods (discussed
in Chapter 3, “Cyber Stalking, Fraud, and Abuse”) to extract data from unsuspecting company
employees. The second, more technology-oriented method is for the individuals to use spyware, which
includes the use of cookies and key loggers. There are other technological methods we will discuss.
Low-Tech Industrial Espionage
Corporate espionage can occur without the benefit of computers or the Internet. Disgruntled former (or
current) employees can copy sensitive documents, divulge corporate strategies and plans, or perhaps
reveal sensitive information. In fact, whether the method used is technological or not, disgruntled
employees are the single greatest security risk to any organization. A corporate spy need not hack into
a system in order to obtain sensitive and confidential information if an employee is willing to simply
hand over the information. Just as with military and political espionage, the motives for the employee
to divulge the information vary. Some engage in such acts for obvious financial gains. Others may elect
to reveal company secrets merely because they are angry over some injustice (real or imagined).
Whatever the motive, any organization has to be cognizant of the fact that it has any number of
employees who may be unhappy with some situation and have the potential to divulge confidential
information.
Certainly, one can obtain information without the benefit of modern technology; however, computer
technology (and various computer-related tactics) can certainly assist in corporate espionage, even if
only in a peripheral manner. Some incidents of industrial espionage are conducted with technology that
requires little skill on the part of the perpetrator, as illustrated in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. This technology
can include using universal serial bus (USB) flash drives, compact discs (CDs), or other portable media
to take information out of the organization. Even disgruntled employees who wish to undermine the
company or make a profit for themselves will find it easier to burn a wealth of data onto a CD and carry
that out in their coat pocket rather than attempt to photocopy thousands of documents and smuggle
them out. And the new USB flash drives, smaller than your average key chain, are a dream come true
for corporate spies. These drives can plug into any USB port and store a tremendous amount of data. As
of this writing, one can easily purchase small portable devices capable of holding 2 terabytes or more
of data.

ptg999
How Does Espionage Occur? 141
While information can be taken from your company without overt hacking of the system, you should
keep in mind that if your system is unsecure, it is entirely possible that an outside party would
compromise your system and obtain that information without an employee as an accomplice. In
addition to these methods, there are other low-tech, or virtually “no-tech,” methods used to extract
information. Social engineering, which was discussed at great length in Chapter 3, is the process of
talking a person into giving up information she otherwise would not divulge. This technique can be
applied to industrial espionage in a number of ways.
The first and most obvious use of social engineering in industrial espionage is in direct conversation in
which the perpetrator attempts to get the targeted employee to reveal sensitive data. As illustrated in
Figure 7.4, employees will often inadvertently divulge information to a supplier, vendor or salesperson
without thinking the information is important or that it could be given to anyone. This involves simply
trying to get the target to talk more than they should. In 2009, there was a widely publicized case of a
Russian spy ring working in the United States. One of their tactics was simply to befriend key
employees in target organizations and, through ongoing conversations, slowly elicit key data.
Another interesting way of using social engineering would be via email. In very large organizations,
one cannot know every member. This loophole allows the clever industrial spy to send an email
message claiming to come from some other department and perhaps simply asking for sensitive data.
A corporate spy might, for example, forge an email to appear to be coming from the legal office of the
target company requesting an executive summary of some research project.
FIGURE 7.4 Social engineering used as low-tech espionage.
ptg999
CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace142
Computer security expert Andrew Briney (Information Security, 2003) places people as the number
one issue in computer security.
Spyware Used in Industrial Espionage
Clearly, any software that can monitor activities on a computer can be used in industrial espionage.
Security IT World, an online e-zine, featured an article in their October 2003 issue that dealt with the
fact that monitoring a computer is an easy thing to do in the twenty-first century. The problem still
persists to this day, with many security experts stating that spyware is at least as widespread as viruses.
One method to accomplish monitoring is via spyware, which we discussed in detail in Chapter 5,
“Malware.” Clearly, software or hardware that logs key strokes or takes screenshots would be most
advantageous to the industrial spy.
The application of this type of software to espionage is obvious. A spy could get screenshots of
sensitive documents, capture logon information for databases, or in fact capture a sensitive document
as it is being typed. Any of these methods would give a spy unfettered access to all data that is
processed on a machine that contains spyware.
Steganography Used in Industrial Espionage 
Steganography is a different way of keeping messages secret. Rather than hide them through
encryption, it protects communication via obscuring them. Messages are hidden within images. And in
some cases other images are hidden within images. The word steganography comes from the Greek
steganos, meaning covered or secret, and graphy, meaning writing or drawing. There are several tech-
nical means to accomplish this, but the most common is to conceal the data in the least significant bits
of an image file. However, data can be concealed in any sort of digital file. 
It should also be noted that historically there have been nontechnical means of hiding messages. A few
notable examples include the following:
■ The ancient Chinese wrapped notes in wax and swallowed them for transport.
■ In ancient Greece a messenger’s head might be shaved, a message written on his head, then his
hair was allowed to grow back.
■ In 1518, Johannes Trithmeus wrote a book on cryptography and described a technique where a
message was hidden by having each letter taken as a word from a specific column
You might think that steganography requires a great deal of technical knowledge to accomplish;
however, there are many software packages available that will perform the steganography for you.
Quick Stego and Invisible Secrets are two very easy-to-use software tools that will do steganography
for you. MP3Stego is a free tool that hides data inside MP4 files. These are just a few of the tools that
one can find on the Internet. The widespread availability of cheap or free tools that are easy to use
makes steganography a greater threat to any organization.
ptg999
Protecting against Industrial Espionage 143
Phone Taps and Bugs
Of course, there is always the possibility of using phone taps. A phone tap is simply the process of
tying into the phone line at some point and intercepting calls. This is often done at some utility location
inside the building one wishes to tap. Obviously, this sort of attack requires the attacker to at least enter
on or near the premises, compromise phone equipment, and to have the skill to tap into the phone line.
Protecting against Industrial Espionage
By now, you are aware that there are many ways that your organization’s valuable information assets
can be compromised. The question thus becomes this: What steps can you take to alleviate the danger?
Note that I said “alleviate” the danger. There is nothing you can do to make any system, any infor-
mation, or any person, totally secure. Totally unbreakable security is simply a myth. The best you can
do is work to achieve a level of security that makes the effort required to get information more costly
than the value of the information.
One obvious protection is to employ antispyware software. As was mentioned earlier in this book,
many antivirus programs also have antispyware capabilities. This software, coupled with other security
measures such as firewalls and intrusion-detection software (both examined in Chapter 9, “Computer
Security Software”), should drastically reduce the chance that an outside party will compromise your
organization’s data. Furthermore, implementing organizational policies (also discussed in Chapter 9)
that help guide employees on safely using computer and Internet resources will make your system rela-
tively secure. If you add to your protection arsenal the strategy of encrypting all transmissions, your
system will be as secure as you can reasonably make it. (Chapter 8, “Encryption, is devoted to
encryption.) However, all of these techniques (firewalls, company policies, antispyware, encryption,
and so forth) will only help in cases in which the employee is not the spy. What do you do to ameliorate
the danger of employees intentionally stealing or compromising information? Actually, there are
several courses of action any organization can take to lesson risks due to internal espionage. Here are
12 steps you can use:
1. Always use all reasonable network security: firewalls, intrusion-detection software, antispy-
ware, patching and updating the operating system, and proper usage policies.
2. Give the personnel of the company access to only the data that they absolutely need to perform
their jobs. This concept is referred to as least privileges. The employees are given the minimum
privileges necessary to perform their job tasks. Use a “need-to-know” approach. One does not
want to stifle discussion or exchange of ideas, but sensitive data must be treated with great care.
3. If possible, set up a system for those employees with access to the most sensitive data in which
there is a rotation or a separation of duties. In this way, no one employee has access and control
over all critical data at one time.
ptg999
CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace144
4. Limit the number of portable storage media in the organization (such as CD burners, zip disks,
and flash drives) and control access to these media. Log every use of such media and what was
stored. Some organizations have even prohibited cell phones because many phones allow the
user to photograph items and send the pictures electronically.
5. Do not allow employees to take documents/media home. Bringing materials home may indicate
a very dedicated employee working on her own time or a corporate spy copying important
documents and information.
6. Shred documents and melt old disks/tape backups/CDs. A resourceful spy can often find a great
deal of information in the garbage. If any storage media is disposed of, it should be completely
wiped. Degaussing is a good technique for hard drives and USB drives. 
7. Do employee background checks. You must be able to trust your employees, and you can only
do this with a thorough background check. Do not rely on “gut feelings.” Give particular
attention to information technology (IT) personnel who will, by the nature of their jobs, have a
greater access to a wider variety of data. This scrutiny is most important with positions such as
database administrators, network administrators, and network security specialists.
8. When any employee leaves the company, scan the employee’s PC carefully. Look for signs that
inappropriate data was kept on that machine. If you have any reason to suspect any inappro-
priate usage, then store the machine for evidence in any subsequent legal proceedings.
9. Keep all tape backups, sensitive documents, and other media under lock and key, with limited
access to them.
10. If portable computers are used, then encrypt the hard drives. Encryption prevents a thief from
extracting useable data from a stolen laptop. There are a number of products on the market that
accomplish this encryption, including the following:
■ Trucrypt (see Figure 7.5) is one of my favorite tools for encrypting drives, folders or parti-
tions. The tool is free, and remarkably easy to use. It can be found at www.truecrypt.org/.
■ Microsoft Windows includes two types of encryption. Windows 7 Enterprise or Ultimate
edition includes BitLocker, for encrypting entire hard drives. And all versions of Win-
dows since Windows 2000 have included Encrypted File System for encrypting specific
files or folders.
■ This list is not exhaustive; therefore, it is highly recommended that you carefully review a
variety of encryption products before making a selection.
11. Have all employees with access to any sensitive information sign nondisclosure agreements.
Such agreements give you, the employer, a recourse should an ex-employee divulge sensitive
data. It is amazing how many employers do not bother with this rather simple protection.
ptg999
Protecting against Industrial Espionage 145
FIGURE 7.5 Trucrypt.
FIGURE 7.6 Windows EFS.
12. Security awareness sessions: Clearly, employee education is one of the most important things you
can do. An organization should have some method for routinely advising employees about secu-
rity issues. An excellent way to do that is to have an intranet site that has security bulletins posted
to it. It is also a good idea to have periodic training sessions for employees. These need not be
lengthy or in depth. Most nontechnical employees only need an introduction to security concepts.
ptg999
CHAPTER 7 Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace146
Unfortunately, following these simple rules will not make you totally immune to corporate espionage.
However, using these strategies will make any such attempts much more difficult for any perpetrator
and, thus, you will improve your organization’s data security.
Industrial Espionage Act
The Industrial Espionage Act of 1996 was the first U.S. law to criminalize theft of commercial trade
secrets. This law provides for significant penalties for violators. Quoting from the actual law:
(a) Whoever, with intent to convert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a product that is produced
for or placed in interstate or foreign commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone other than the owner
thereof, and intending or knowing that the offense will injure any owner of that trade secret, knowingly —
(1) steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes, carries away, or conceals, or by fraud, artifice,
or deception obtains such information;
(2) without authorization copies, duplicates, sketches, draws, photographs, downloads, uploads, alters,
destroys, photocopies, replicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails, communicates, or conveys such infor-
mation;
(3) receives, buys, or possesses such information, knowing the same to have been stolen or appro-
priated, obtained, or converted without authorization;
(4) attempts to commit any offense described in paragraphs (1) through (3); or
(5) conspires with one or more other persons to commit any offense described in paragraphs (1) through
(3), and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, shall, except as
provided in subsection (b), be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.
Spear Phishing
Phishing, as you know, is a process of attempting to get personal information from a target in order to
steal the target’s identity or compromise the target’s system. A common technique is to send out a mass
email that is designed to entice recipients into clicking on a link that purports to be some financial insti-
tutions website but is actually a phishing website.
Spear phishing is using the same technology in a targeted manner. For example, if an attacker wanted
to get into the servers at a defense contractor, he might craft email and phishing websites specifically
to target software and network engineers at that company. The emails might be made to appear of
interest to that specific subgroup of people. Or the attacker might even take the time to learn personal
details of a few of these individuals and target them specifically. This technique has been used against
executives at various companies. In 2010 and 2011, this problem began to grow significantly.

Summary
A number of conclusions can be drawn from the examination of industrial espionage. The first
conclusion: It does indeed occur. The case studies clearly demonstrate that industrial espionage is not
some exotic fantasy dreamed up by paranoid security experts. It is an unfortunate, but quite real, aspect
of modern business. If your firm’s management chooses to ignore these dangers, then they do so at
their own peril.
The second thing that can be concluded from this brief study of industrial espionage is that there are a
variety of methods by which espionage can take place. An employee revealing confidential information
is perhaps the most common. However, compromising information systems is another increasingly
popular means of obtaining confidential and potentially valuable data. You will want to know the best
way to protect your company and yourself. In the upcoming exercises at the end of this chapter, you
will run screen-capture software, key loggers, and antispyware.

Case Study
David Doe is a network administrator for the ABC Company. David is passed over for promotion
three times. He is quite vocal in his dissatisfaction with this situation. In fact, he begins to express
negative opinions about the organization in general. Eventually, David quits and begins his own
consulting business. Six months after David’s departure, it is discovered that a good deal of the
ABC Company’s research has suddenly been duplicated by a competitor. Executives at ABC sus-
pect that David Doe has done some consulting work for this competitor and may have passed on
sensitive data. However, in the interim since David left, his computer has been formatted and reas-
signed to another person. ABC has no evidence that David Doe did anything wrong.

Encryption
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Explain the basics of encryption
■ Discuss modern cryptography methods
■ Select appropriate cryptography for your organization
■ Understand the function and protocols of UPNs
Introduction
There are many aspects of computer and information security. Encryption, the process of scrambling a
message or other information so that it cannot be easily read, is one of the most critical parts to the
security puzzle. If you have the best firewall, very tight security policies, hardened operating systems,
virus scanners, intrusion-detection software, antispyware, and every other computer security angle
covered but send your data in raw, plain text, then you simply are not secure.
In this chapter, you will obtain what can be termed a “manager’s understanding” of cryptography—the
art of writing in or deciphering secret code. It is important to understand that this chapter will not make
you a cryptographer. In fact, reading several volumes on encryption would not accomplish that lofty
goal. Rather, this chapter is designed to give you a basic overview of what encryption is, some idea of
how it works, and enough information so that you can make intelligent decisions about what sorts of
encryption to incorporate in your organization. You will learn the basic history of encryption, the
fundamental concepts, and after you have completed the exercises at the end of the chapter you’ll have
enough knowledge to at least be able to ask the right questions. Now this does not mean we won’t
cover some technical details, because we will. But the focus of this chapter is to give you a broad
understanding of the relevant concepts.

History of Encryption 155
We will go into the actual process of some of the cryptography algorithms presented. For example, we
will show you the process of DES and RSA. It is beyond the scope of this book to go in depth into
every cryptographic algorithm available, but it is useful for you to see a few of them described in detail.
Cryptography Basics
The aim of cryptography is not to hide the existence of a message, but rather to hide its meaning—the
process known as encryption. To make a message unintelligible, it is scrambled according to a
particular algorithm, which is agreed upon beforehand between the sender and the intended recipient.
Thus, the recipient can reverse the scrambling protocol and make the message comprehensible (Singh,
2001a). This reversal of the scrambling is referred to as decryption. The advantage of using
encryption/decryption is that, without knowing the scrambling protocol, the message is difficult to 
re-create.
There are two basic types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric means the same key
is used to encrypt the message and to decrypt the message. With asymmetric cryptography, a different
key is used to encrypt the message than is used to decrypt the message. That may sound a bit odd, and
some readers may be pondering how that is possible. Later in this chapter, we will explore exactly how
that works. For now the important point is to understand the basic concept of symmetric and asym-
metric cryptography. But first, let’s take a brief look at the history of encryption.
History of Encryption
The idea of encryption is probably as old as written communication. The basic concept is actually
fairly simple. Messages must be changed in such a way that the message cannot be easily read by an
enemy, but they can be easily decoded by the intended recipient. In this section, you will examine a few
historical methods of encryption. It should be noted that these are very old methods, and they cannot be
used for secure communication today. The methods discussed in this section would be easily cracked,
even by an amateur. However, they are wonderful for conveying the concept of encryption without
having to incorporate a great deal of math, which is required of the more complex encryption methods. 
FYI: Cryptographers
Encryption is a very broad and complex subject area. Even amateur cryptographers typically have
some mathematical training and have studied cryptographic methods for several years.
If you are interested in learning more about the history of cryptography than what we touch upon here,
you may wish to read one of the many books written on the subject. Or, you might consult the
following websites which are shown in Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2.

Understanding the simple methods described here and other methods listed on the aforementioned
websites should give you a sense of how cryptography works as well as what is involved in encrypting
a message. Regardless of whether you go on to study modern, sophisticated encryption methods, it is
important for you to have some basic idea of how encryption works at a conceptual level. Having a
basic grasp of how encryption works, in principle, will make you better able to understand the concepts
of any encryption method you encounter in the real world.

The Caesar Cipher
One of the oldest encryption methods is the Caesar cipher. This method is purported to have been used
by the ancient roman Caesars—thus the name. It is actually quite simple to do. You choose some
number by which to shift each letter of a text. For example, if the text is
A cat
And you choose to shift by two letters, then the message becomes
C ecv
ptg999
CHAPTER 8 Encryption158
Or, if you choose to shift by three letters, it becomes
D fdw
Julius Caesar was reputed to have used a shift of three to the right. However, you can choose any shifting
pattern you wish. You can shift either to the right or left by any number of spaces you like. Because this
is a very simple method to understand, it makes a good place to start our study of encryption. It is,
however, extremely easy to crack. You see, any language has a certain letter and word frequency,
meaning that some letters are used more frequently than others (Letter Frequency Distributions in the
English Alphabet, 2003). In the English language, the most common single-letter word is A. The most
common three-letter word is the. Those two rules alone could help you decrypt a Caesar cipher. For
example, if you saw a string of seemingly nonsense letters and noticed that a three-letter word was
frequently repeated in the message, you might easily surmise that this word was the—and the odds are
highly in favor of this being correct. Furthermore, if you frequently noticed a single-letter word in the
text, it is most likely the letter A.You now have found the substitution scheme for A, T, H, and E.You can
now either translate all of those letters in the message and attempt to surmise the rest or simply analyze
the substitute letters used for A, T, H, and E and derive the substitution cipher that was used for this
message. Decrypting a message of this type does not even require a computer. It could be done in less
than ten minutes using pen and paper by someone with no background in cryptography. There are other
rules that will help make cracking this code even easier. For example, in the English language the two
most common two letter combinations are ee and oo. That gives you even more to work on.
The substitution scheme you choose (e.g., +2, +1) is referred to as a substitution alphabet (i.e., B
substitutes for A, U substitutes for T). Thus, the Caesar cipher is also referred to as a mono-alphabet
substitution method, meaning that it uses a single substitution for the encryption.
The Caesar cipher, however, is not useless. Since most programming languages have some function to
convert a character or number to its ASCII code, a programmer can write a simple function that loops
through text converting each character to its ASCII code, then either adding or subtracting the appro-
priate number. Again, it must be stressed that this is not a secure method of encrypting messages, but it
is an interesting exercise to begin introducing you to the basic concepts of encryption. This is a good
place for students to start getting a grasp of the concept of cryptography.
In Practice
Converting to ASCII Code
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard code for every letter
(upper- and lowercase), number, and key on your keyboard. It was proposed by ANSI
(www.ansi.org) in 1963, and finalized in 1968. ASCII’s purpose was to establish compatibility
between the various types of data processing equipment. All keystrokes can be converted to a
numeric ASCII code.

ASCII, pronounced “ask-key,” is the common code for microcomputer equipment. The standard
ASCII character set consists of 128 decimal numbers ranging from 0 through 127 assigned to
letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and the most common special characters. The Extended
ASCII Character Set also consists of 128 decimal numbers and ranges from 128 through 255,

As we discussed in Chapter 2, “Networks and the Internet,” decimal numbers can be converted to
binary numbers. So, as you can probably guess, there are binary equivalents (as well as hexadecimal
equivalents) to each of these decimal values. Like the ASCII decimal values, there are tables available
for determining either the binary or hexadecimal values. Table 8.2 is an example of a table for deter-
mining hexadecimal values.

Like the conversion to binary numbers that we discussed in Chapter 2, there are many readily available
converters that can make determining the ASCII equivalencies much easier than searching through
tables. A simple search of the Internet will turn up many such converters. Figure 8.3 is an example of a
converter found at www.cplusplus.com/doc/papers/ascii.html. This particular converter, given any one
value, will generate the other three. In this illustration, the uppercase A was entered and the decimal,
hexadecimal, and binary (oct.) numbers were all generated.
FIGURE 8.3 ASCII converter.
Multi-Alphabet Substitution
Eventually, a slight improvement on the Caesar cipher was developed, called multi–alphabet substi-
tution. In this scheme, you select multiple numbers by which to shift letters (i.e., multiple substitution
alphabets). For example, if you select three substitution alphabets (12, 22, 13), then
A CAT
becomes
C ADV
Notice that the fourth letter starts over with another +2, and you can see that the first A was transformed
to C and the second A was transformed to D. This makes it more difficult to decipher the underlying
text. While this is harder to decrypt than a Caesar cipher, it is not overly difficult. It can be done with
simple pen and paper and a bit of effort. It can be cracked very quickly with a computer. In fact, no one
would use such a method today to send any truly secure message, for this type of encryption is
considered very weak. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 8 Encryption162
At one time multi-alphabet substitution was considered quite secure. In fact a special version of this,
called a Vigenère cipher was used in the 1800s and early 1900s. The Vigenère cipher was invented in
1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso. It is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different
Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. Figure 8.4 shows the Vigenère cipher.
FIGURE 8.4 Vigenère
Match the letter of your keyword on the top with the letter of your plain text on the left to find the
cipher text. For example, using the chart shown in Figure 8.4, if you are encrypting the word cat and
your key is horse, then the cipher text is jok.
Binary Operations
Various operations on binary numbers (numbers made of only 0s and 1s) are well known to
programmers and programming students. But for those readers not familiar with them, a brief expla-
nation follows. When working with binary numbers, there are three operations not found in normal
math: AND, OR, and XOR operations. Each is illustrated below.
AND
To perform the AND operation, you take two binary numbers and compare them one place at a time. If
both numbers have a one in both places, then the resultant number is a 1. If not, then the resultant
number is a 0, as you see here:
ptg999
History of Encryption 163
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
––––––________
1 0 0 1
OR
The OR operation checks to see whether there is a 1 in either or both numbers in a given place. If so,
then the resultant number is 1. If not, the resultant number is 0, as you see here:
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
––––––________
1 1 0 1
XOR
The XOR operation impacts your study of encryption the most. It checks to see whether there is a 1 in
a number in a given place, but not in both numbers at that place. If it is in one number but not the other,
then the resultant number is 1. If not, the resultant number is 0, as you see here:
1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1
––––––________
0 1 0 0
XORing has a very interesting property in that it is reversible. If you XOR the resultant number with
the second number, you get back the first number. And, if you XOR the resultant number with the first
number, you get the second number:
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
––––––________
1 1 0 1
Binary encryption using the XOR operation opens the door for some rather simple encryption. Take
any message and convert it to binary numbers and then XOR that with some key. The key is some
string of digits (1s and 0s) that should be random (or at least as random as possible). Converting a
message to a binary number is really a simple two-step process. First, convert a message to its ASCII
code, then convert those codes to binary numbers. Each letter/number will generate an 8-bit binary
number. Then you can use a random string of binary numbers of any given length as the key. Simply
XOR your message with the key to get the encrypted text, then XOR it with the key again to retrieve
the original message. This method is easy to use and great for computer science students; however, it
does not work well for truly secure communications because the underlying letter and word frequency
remains. This exposes valuable clues that even an amateur cryptographer can use to decrypt the
ptg999
CHAPTER 8 Encryption164
message. Yet, it does provide a valuable introduction to the concept of single-key encryption, which
will be discussed in more detail in the next section. While simply XORing the text is not the method
typically employed, single-key encryption methods are widely used today. And binary operations are
often a part of the process. 
Symmetric key cryptography often uses two processes: substitution and transposition. The substitution
portion is accomplished by XORing the plain text message with the key. The transposition is done by
swapping blocks of the text. 
Modern Methods
Modern cryptography methods, as well as computers, make decryption a rather advanced science.
Therefore, encryption must be equally sophisticated in order to have a chance of success.
What you have seen so far regarding encryption is simply for educational purposes. As has been noted
several times, you would not have a truly secure system if you implemented any of the previously
mentioned encryption schemes. You may feel that this has been overstated in this text. However, it is
critical that you have an accurate view of what encryption methods do and do not work. It is now time
to discuss a few methods that are actually in use today.
Before we delve too deeply into this topic, let’s start with some basic definitions you will need:
■ Key: The bits that are combined with the plain text to encrypt it. In some cases this is random
numbers, in other cases it is the result of some mathematical operation.
■ Plain text: The unencrypted text.
■ Cipher text: The encrypted text.
■ Algorithm: A mathematical process for doing something.
Single-Key (Symmetric) Encryption
Basically, single-key encryption means that the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt a
message. This is also referred to as symmetric key encryption. There are two types of symmetric algo-
rithms: stream and block. A block cipher divides the data into blocks (often 64-bit blocks, but newer
algorithms sometimes use 128-bit blocks) and encrypts the data one block at a time. Stream ciphers
encrypt the data as a stream of bits, one bit at a time.
Data Encryption Standard Data Encryption Standard, or DES as it is often called, was
developed by IBM in the early 1970s. DES is a block cipher. The DES uses short keys and relies on
complex procedures to protect its information. The actual DES algorithm is quite complex and
beyond the scope of this text. The basic concept, however, is as follows (Federal Information
Processing Standards, 2004):

Modern Methods 165
FYI: Block Ciphers and Stream Ciphers
When applying a key to plain text to encrypt it and produce the cipher text, you must also choose
how to apply the key and the algorithm. In a block cipher, the key is applied to blocks (often 64 bits
in size) at a time. This differs from a stream cipher that encrypts 1 bit at a time.
1. Data is divided into 64-bit blocks, and those blocks are then transposed.
2. Transposed data is then manipulated by 16 separate steps of encryption involving substitutions,
bit-shifting, and logical operations using a 56-bit key.
3. Data is then further scrambled using a swapping algorithm.
4. Data is finally transposed one last time.
One advantage that DES offers is efficiency. Some implementations of DES offer data throughput rates on
the order of hundreds of megabytes per second. In plain English, what this means is that it can encrypt a
great deal of data very quickly. You might assume that 16 steps would cause encryption to be quite slow;
however, that is not the case using modern computer equipment. The problem with DES is the same
problem that all symmetric key algorithms have: How do you transmit the key without risking it becoming
compromised? This issue led to the development of public key encryption. And another problem is that
over time it has become no longer viable for modern encryption. The 56-bit key is simply not long enough.
3DES or Triple DES, was created as a replacement for DES. At the time, the cryptography community
was searching for a viable alternative. While that was still being worked on, a stop-gap measure was
created. It essentially applies DES three times with three different keys, thus the name 3DES.
AES, or Advanced Encryption Standard, was the algorithm eventually chosen to replace DES. It is a
block cipher that works on 128 bit blocks. It can have one of three key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
This was selected by the United States Government to be the replacement for DES and is now the
most widely used symmetric key algorithm. 
Blowfish Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher. It uses a variable-length key ranging from 32 to
448 bits (McCrypto.net, 2004). This flexibility in key size allows you to use it in various situations.
Blowfish was designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier. It has been analyzed extensively by the
cryptography community and has gained wide acceptance. It is also a non-commercial (i.e., free of
charge) product, thus making it attractive to budget-conscious organizations. It should also be pointed
out that Blowfish was also a finalist for the U.S. Department of Defense, when they were seeking a
replacement for DES.
RC4 The other symmetric algorithms we have discussed have all been block ciphers. RC4 is a
stream cipher developed by Ron Rivest. The RC is an acronym for Ron’s Cipher. There are other RC
versions such as RC5 and RC6.

CHAPTER 8 Encryption166
Public Key (Asymmetric) Encryption
Public key encryption is essentially the opposite of single-key encryption. With any public key encryption
algorithm, one key is used to encrypt a message (called the public key) and another is used to decrypt the
message (called the private key). You can freely distribute your public key so that anyone can encrypt a
message to send to you, but only you have the private key and only you can decrypt the message. The actual
mathematics behind the creation and application of the keys will vary between different asymmetric algo-
rithms. We will look at the math for RSA later in this section. It should be pointed out, however, that many
public key algorithms are dependent, to some extent, on large prime numbers, factoring, and number theory.
Many commonly used algorithms, such as PGP, use public key encryption. It is very easy to implement
since the public key can be freely distributed to anyone and sometimes even put on a website for download.
Caution
Encryption Strength
Federal law prohibits the exportation of encryption beyond a certain strength. Currently, that exact
limit is being contested in various court cases. It is recommended that you consult current federal
guidelines before implementing encryption in your organization.
Public key encryption is fast becoming the most widely used type of encryption because there are no
issues to deal with concerning distribution of the keys. With symmetric key encryption, you must get a
copy of the key to every person to whom you wish to send your encrypted messages. If that key were
lost or copied, someone else might be able to decrypt all of your messages. With public key encryption,
you can freely distribute your public key to the entire world, yet only you can decrypt messages
encrypted with that public key.
PGP PGP, a public key system, stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It is a widely used system that is
considered very secure by most experts (International PGP Website, 2004). There are several software
implementations available as freeware for most desktop operating systems. There are PGP plug-ins for
MSN Messenger and many other popular communications software packages (McCune, 2004). A
simple Yahoo! or Google search for PGP will help you find many of these software products.
FYI: “Old” Encryption
PGP is more than ten years old. Some readers might wonder whether it is old and outdated. Cryp-
tography is unlike other technological endeavors in this regard: Older is better. It is usually unwise
to use the “latest thing” in encryption for the simple reason that it is unproven. An older encryption
method, provided it has not yet been broken, is usually a better choice because it has been
subjected to years of examination by experts and to cracking attempts by both experts and less
honorably motivated individuals. This is sometimes hard for computer professionals to understand
since the newest technology is often preferred in the computer business.
ptg999
Modern Methods 167
PGP was invented by Phil Zimmerman (Zimmerman, 2004). Before creating PGP, Mr. Zimmerman
had been a software engineer for 20 years and had experience with existing forms of cryptography. A
great deal of controversy surrounded the birth of PGP because it was created without an easy means for
government intrusion and its encryption was considered too strong for export. This caused Mr.
Zimmerman to be the target of a three-year government investigation. However, those legal matters are
now resolved and PGP is one of the most widely used encryption methods available. 
The important things to know about PGP are that it is
■ A public key encryption
■ Considered quite secure
■ Available free of charge
These facts make it well worth your time to investigate PGP as a possible solution for your organi-
zation’s encryption needs. 
RSA The RSA method is a very widely used encryption algorithm. You cannot discuss cryptography
without at least some discussion of RSA. This is a public key method developed in 1977 by three math-
ematicians, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adlema. The name RSA is derived from the first letter of
each mathematician’s last name (Burnett and Paine, 2001). Let us take a look at the math involved in
RSA. It should be pointed out that knowing the math behind this, or any other algorithm, is not critical
for most security professionals. But some readers will have an interest in going deeper into cryptog-
raphy and this will be a good place to start. 
First to create the key you start by generating two large random primes, p and q, of approximately
equal size. Now you need to pick two numbers so that when multiplied together the product will be the
size you want (i.e., 128 bits, 256 bits, etc.). 
Now multiply p and q to get n.
Let n = pq
The next step is to multiple something called the Euler’s totient for each of these primes. Basically, the
Euler’s totient is the total number of co-prime numbers. Two numbers are considered co-prime if they
have no common factors. For example if the original number is 7, then 5 and 7 would be co-prime. It just
so happens that for prime numbers, this is always the number minus 1. For example 7 has 6 numbers that
are co-prime to it. (If you think about this a bit you will see that 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all co-prime with 7.)
Let m = (p – 1)(q – 1)
Now we are going to select another number, we will call this number e. We want to pick e so that it is
co-prime to m.
Choose a small number e, co-prime to m.
ptg999
CHAPTER 8 Encryption168
We are almost done generating a key. Now we just find a number d that when multiplied by e and
modulo m would yield a 1. (Note: Modulo means to divide two numbers and return the remainder. For
example 8 modulo 3 would be 2.)
Find d, such that de % m = 1
Now you will publish e and n as the public key. Keep d and n as the secret key. To encrypt, you simply
take your message raised to the e power and modulo n.
= me % n
To decrypt you take the cipher text and raise it to the d power modulo n.
P = Cd % n
If all this seems a bit complex to you, first you must realize that many people work in network security
without being familiar with the actual algorithm for RSA (or any other cryptography for that matter).
However, if you wish to go deeper into cryptography then this is a very good start. It involves some
fundamental number theory, particularly regarding prime numbers. There are other asymmetric algo-
rithms that work in a different manner. For example, elliptic curve cryptography is one such example.
Legitimate Versus Fraudulent Encryption Methods
The encryption methods discussed above are just a few of the more widely used modern encryption
methods. Dozens of other methods are released to the public for free or are patented and sold for profit
every year. However, it is important to realize that this particular area of the computer industry is
replete with frauds and charlatans. One need only scan any search engine searching for encryption to
find a plethora of advertisements for the latest and greatest “unbreakable” encryption. If you are not
knowledgeable about encryption, how do you separate legitimate encryption methods from frauds?
There are many fraudulent cryptographic claims out there. You do not have to be a cryptography expert
to be able to avoid many of those fraudulent claims. Here are some warning signs:
■ Unbreakable: Anyone with experience in cryptography knows that there is no such thing as an
unbreakable code. There are codes that have not yet been broken. There are codes that are very
hard to break. But when someone claims that their method is “completely unbreakable,” you
should be suspicious.
■ Certified: Guess what? There is no recognized certification process for encryption methods.
Therefore, any “certification” the company has is totally worthless.
■ Inexperienced people: A company is marketing a new encryption method. What is the experi-
ence of the people working with it? Does the cryptographer have a background in math, encryp-
tion, or algorithms? If not, has he submitted their method to experts in peer-reviewed journals?
Or, is he at least willing to disclose how their method works so that it can be fairly judged? Re-
call that PGP’s inventor had decades of software engineering and encryption experience.
ptg999
Legitimate Versus Fraudulent Encryption Methods 169
Some experts claim that you should only use widely known methods, such as Blowfish and PGP,
although it is certainly possible to use less well-known, or even new, encryption methods and have a
very secure system. Consider the fact that today’s widely used methods were once new and untested.
However, if you are using a less well-known method, you need to take extra precautions to ensure that
you are not being misled.
Digital Signatures
A digital signature is not used to ensure the confidentiality of a message, but rather to guarantee who
sent the message. This is referred to as nonrepudiation. Essentially, it proves who the sender is. Digital
signatures are actually rather simple, but clever. They simply reverse the asymmetric encryption
process. Recall that in asymmetric encryption, the public key (which anyone can have access to) is
used to encrypt a message to the recipient, and the private key (which is kept secure, and private) can
decrypt it. With a digital signature, the sender encrypts something with his or her private key. If the
recipient is able to decrypt that with the sender’s public key, then it must have been sent by the person
purported to have sent the message.
Hashing
A hashing is a type of cryptographic algorithm that has some specific characteristics. First and foremost
it is one-way. That means you cannot “unhash” something. The second characteristic is that you get a
fixed-length output no matter what input is given. This is exactly how Windows stores passwords. For
example, if your password is password, then Windows will first hash it producing something like this:
0BD181063899C9239016320B50D3E896693A96DF
Windows will then store that in the SAM (Security Accounts Manager) file in the Windows System
directory. When you log on, Windows cannot unhash your password (remember it is one-way). So,
what Windows does is take whatever password you type in, hash it, and then compare the result with
what is in the SAM file. If they match (exactly), then you can log in. 
Storing Windows passwords is just one application of hashing. There are others. For example, in
computer forensics it is common to hash a drive before you begin forensic examination. Then later you
can always hash it again to see if anything was changed (accidently or intentionally). If the second hash
matches the first, then nothing has been changed.
There are various hashing algorithms. The two most common are MD5 and SHA (it was SHA-1 but
since then later versions like SHA-256 are becoming more common).
Authentication
When one logs on to a system, the system needs to authenticate the user (and sometimes the user needs
to authenticate the system!). There are many authentication protocols. A few of the more common are
briefly described here:
ptg999
CHAPTER 8 Encryption170
■ PAP: Password Authentication Protocol is the simplest form of authentication and the least se-
cure. Usernames and passwords are sent unencrypted, in plain text.
■ SPAP: Shiva Password Authentication Protocol is an extension to PAP that does encrypt the
username and password that is sent over the Internet.
■ CHAP: Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol calculates a hash after the user has logged
in. Then it shares that hash with the client system. Periodically the server will ask the client to
provide that hash (this is the challenge part). If the client cannot, then it is clear that the communi-
cations have been compromised .MS-CHAP is a Microsoft-specific extension to CHAP.
■ Kerberos: Kerberos is used widely, particularly with Microsoft operating systems. It was
invented at MIT and derives its name from the mythical three-headed dog that was reputed to
guard the gates of Hades. The system is a bit complex but the basic process is as follows:
When a user logs in, the authentication server verifies the user’s identity and then contacts the
ticket granting server (these are often on the same machine). The ticket granting server sends an
encrypted “ticket” to the user’s machine. That ticket identifies the user as being logged in. Later
when the user needs to access some resource on the network, the user’s machine uses that ticket
granting ticket to get access to the target machine. There is a great deal of verification for the
tickets, and these tickets expire in a relatively short time.
Encryptions Used in Internet
What sort of encryption is used on bank websites and e-commerce? In general, symmetric algorithms
are faster, and require a shorter key length to be as secure as asymmetric algorithms. However, there is
the problem of how to securely exchange keys. So most e-commerce solutions use an asymmetric algo-
rithm to exchange symmetric keys and then use the symmetric keys to encrypt the actual data.
When visiting websites that have an HTTPS at the beginning, rather than HTTP, the S denotes secure.
That means traffic between your browser and the web server is encrypted. This is usually done with
either SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security). SSL, the older of the two tech-
nologies, was developed by Netscape. SSL and TLS are both asymmetric systems. 
Virtual Private Networks
A VPN is a virtual private network. This is essentially a way to use the Internet to create a virtual
connection between a remote user or site and a central location. The packets sent back and forth over this
connection are encrypted, thus making it private. The VPN must emulate a direct network connection.
There are three different protocols that are used to create VPNs:
■ Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
■ Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)
■ Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)
These are each discussed in more depth in the following sections.
ptg999
Virtual Private Networks 171
PPTP
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is the oldest of the three protocols used in VPNs. It was
originally designed as a secure extension to Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). PPTP was originally
proposed as a standard in 1996 by the PPTP Forum—a group of companies that included Ascend
Communications, ECI Telematics, Microsoft, 3Com, and U.S. Robotics. It adds the features of
encrypting packets and authenticating users to the older PPP protocol. PPTP works at the data link
layer of the OSI model (discussed in Chapter 2).
PPTP offers two different methods of authenticating the user: Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). EAP was actually designed specif-
ically for PPTP and is not proprietary. CHAP is a three-way process whereby the client sends a code to
the server, the server authenticates it, and then the server responds to the client. CHAP also periodi-
cally re-authenticates a remote client, even after the connection is established.
PPTP uses Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) to encrypt packets. MPPE is actually a
version of DES. DES is still useful for many situations; however, newer versions of DES, such as DES
3, are preferred.
L2TP
Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) was explicitly designed as an enhancement to PPTP. Like PPTP, it
works at the data link layer of the OSI model. It has several improvements to PPTP. First, it offers more
and varied methods for authentication—PPTP offers two, whereas L2TP offers five. In addition to
CHAP and EAP, L2TP offers PAP, SPAP, and MS-CHAP.
In addition to more authentication protocols available for use, L2TP offers other enhancements. PPTP
will only work over standard IP networks, whereas L2TP will work over X.25 networks (a common
protocol in phone systems) and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode, a high-speed networking tech-
nology) systems. L2TP also uses IPsec for its encryption.
IPsec
IPsec is short for Internet Protocol Security. It is the latest of the three VPN protocols. One of the
differences between IPsec and the other two methods is that it encrypts not only the packet data (recall
the discussion of packets in Chapter 2), but also the header information. It also has protection against
unauthorized retransmission of packets. This is important because one trick that a hacker can use is to
simply grab the first packet from a transmission and use it to get their own transmissions to go through.
Essentially, the first packet (or packets) has to contain the login data. If you simply resend that packet
(even if you cannot crack its encryption), you will be sending a valid logon and password that can then
be followed with additional packets. Preventing unauthorized retransmission of packets prevents this
from happening.

CHAPTER 8 Encryption172
Summary
A basic element of computer security is encryption. Sending sensitive data that is not encrypted is
simply foolish. This chapter provided the basic information on how cryptography works. The most
important thing to remember is that, ultimately, it is not your computer or your network that will be
compromised but rather your data. Encrypting the data when transmitting it is an integral part of any
security plan.
In the exercises at the end of this chapter, you will practice using different cipher methods and learn
more about a number of encryption methods.

At this point in your studies, you should have a good idea of what the real dangers are and what
adequate security policies include, as well as a basic understanding of the various forms of computer
crime. However, if you are striving to secure your network, you will need more technical details on the
various security devices and software you might choose to employ. This chapter reviews these items
with enough detail to allow you to make intelligent decisions on which types of products you will see.
Most of these devices have been mentioned and briefly described in the preceding chapters. The intent
of this chapter is to delve more deeply into details of how these devices work. This information is of
particular value to those readers who intend to eventually enter the computer security profession.
Simply having a theoretical knowledge of computer security is inadequate. You must have some prac-

Virus Scanners 179
Virus Scanners
A virus scanner is essentially software that tries to prevent a virus from infecting your system. This fact
is probably abundantly obvious to most readers. Knowing how a virus scanner works, however, is
another matter. This topic was discussed briefly in our previous discussions on viruses, but will be
elaborated on in this chapter.
In general, virus scanners work in two ways. The first method is that they contain a list of all known
virus definitions. The virus definitions are simply files that list known viruses, their file size, prop-
erties, and behavior. Generally, one of the services that vendors of virus scanners provide is a periodic
update of this file. This list is typically in a small file, often called a .dat file (short for data). When you
update your virus definitions, what actually occurs is that your current file is replaced by the more
recent one on the vendor’s website.
The antivirus program can then scan your PC, network, and incoming email for known virus files. Any
file on your PC or attached to an email is compared to the virus definition file to see whether there are
any matches. With emails, this can be done by looking for specific subject lines and content. Known
virus files often have specific phrases in the subject line and the body of the messages they are attached
to. Yet viruses and worms can have a multitude of headers, some of which are very common, such as
re:hello or re:thanks. Scanning against a list of known viruses alone would result in many false posi-
tives. Therefore, the virus scanner also looks at attachments to see whether they are of a certain size
and creation date that matches a known virus or whether it contains known viral code. The file size,
creation date, and location are the telltale signs of a virus.
How Does a Virus Scanner Work?
An article in the July 2004 issue of Scientific American, titled “How Does a Virus Scanner Work,”
stated that a virus scanner is essentially software that searches for the signature or pattern of known
virus. Keep in mind that the scanner only works if you keep it updated. And, of course, it only works
with known viruses.
The second way a virus scanner works is to watch for certain types of behaviors that are typical of a
virus. This might include any program that attempts to write to your hard drive’s boot sector, change
system files, automate your email software, or self-multiply. Programs that attempt to modify the
system Registry (for Windows systems) or alter any system settings may also be indicative of a virus.
Another feature that virus scanners search for is a file that will stay in memory after it executes. This is
called a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program. Some legitimate programs do this, but it is often
a sign of a virus. Additionally, some virus scanners use more sophisticated methods, such as scanning
your system files and monitoring any program that attempts to modify those files.
It is also important to differentiate between on-demand virus scanning and ongoing scanners. An
ongoing virus scanner runs in the background and is constantly checking your PC for any sign of a
virus. On-demand virus scanners run only when you launch them. Many modern antivirus scanners
offer both options.

CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software180
Virus-Scanning Techniques
In general, there are five ways a virus scanner might scan for virus infections. Some of these were
mentioned in the previous section, but they are outlined and defined below:
■ Email and attachment scanning: Since the primary propagation method for a virus is email,
email and attachment scanning is the most important function of any virus scanner. Some virus
scanners actually examine your email on the email server before downloading it to your ma-
chine. Other virus scanners work by scanning your emails and attachments on your computer
before passing it to your email program. In either case, the email and its attachments should be
scanned prior to you having any chance to open it and release the virus on your system.
■ Download scanning: Anytime you download anything from the Internet, either via a Web link
or through some FTP program, there is a chance you might download an infected file.
Download scanning works much like email and attachment scanning, but does so on files you
select for downloading.
■ File scanning: This is the type of scanning in which files on your system are checked to see
whether they match any known virus. This sort of scanning is generally done on an on-demand
basis instead of an ongoing basis. It is a good idea to schedule your virus scanner to do a
complete scan of the system periodically. I personally recommend a weekly scan, preferably at
a time when no one is likely to be using the computer.
■ Heuristic Scanning: This is perhaps the most advanced form of virus scanning. This sort of
scanning uses rules to determine whether a file or program is behaving like a virus and is one of
the best ways to find a virus that is not a known virus. A new virus will not be on any virus
definition list, so you must examine its behavior to determine whether it is a virus. However,
this process is not foolproof. Some actual virus infections will be missed, and some nonvirus
files might be suspected of being a virus.
■ Sandbox: Another approach is the sandbox approach. This basically means that you have a
separate area, isolated from the operating system, in which a download or attachment is run.
Then if it is infected, it won’t infect the operating system. 
One way to accomplish this is for the operating system to set aside a protected area of memory
to open the suspected file and to monitor its behavior. This is not 100% effective, but it is far
safer than simply opening files on your system and hoping there is no infection.
A related concept is called a “sheep dip” machine. This is useful in corporate networks. You set
up a system that is identical in configuration to your standard workstations. However, this sheep
dip machine is not networked. Suspect files are opened first on this system. Then the system is
monitored for a period of time for signs of infection. Once the file has cleared this check, it can
then be opened on normal workstations.
A simple way to do this in a home or small office is to set up a virtual machine on your
computer and to open suspected attachments or downloads in the virtual machine first. If they
are okay, then open them on your main system.
ptg999
Virus Scanners 181
FYI: How Most Commercial Scanners Work
Most commercial virus scanners use multiple methods, including most, if not all, of the methods
listed here. Any virus scanner that uses only one scanning modality would be virtually worthless
from a practical virus defense perspective. These modalities are how a scanner works regardless
of whether it is using a heuristic scan, download scan, email scan, and so on.
■ Active code scanning: Modern websites frequently embed active codes, such as Java
applets and ActiveX. These technologies can provide some stunning visual effects to any
website. However, they can also be a vehicle for malicious code. Scanning such objects
before they are downloaded to your computer is an essential feature in any quality virus
scanner.
■ False positives and false negatives: Regardless of the type of virus scanner, any
antivirus software will occasionally have an error. There are two types of errors that you
should be concerned with. It is possible that your antivirus software will mistake a legit-
imate program for a virus. For example, you might have a program that is supposed to
make some adjustment to the Windows Registry or to scan your email address book.
Mistaking a legitimate program for a virus is referred to as a false positive. It is also
possible that your antivirus will fail to recognize a virus. This is referred to as a false
negative. The best way to minimize false negatives is to keep your antivirus software
updated. For false positives, it is recommended that you simply quarantine suspected
viruses and not automatically delete them.
Commercial Antivirus Software
There are three brands of antivirus software that virtually dominate the antivirus market today and a
number of companies that offer a commercial scanner also offer a free version that does not provide as
many features as the commercial product. For example, AVG AntiVirus, available from
www.grisoft.com, is a commercial product, but the company also offers the AVG AntiVirus Free
Edition. McAfee, Norton, and Kapersky are three very well-known antivirus vendors. All three
products are good choices, and also come with additional options, such as spam filters and personal
firewalls. Any of these three products can be purchased for a home machine for about $30 to $60
(depending on options you add). This purchase price includes a one-year subscription to update the
virus files so that your antivirus software will recognize all known virus attacks. Organizational
licenses are also available to cover an entire network.
Of course, there are other antivirus solutions available. Several free virus scanners can easily be found
on the Internet. McAfee, Norton, and Kapersky are mentioned here because they are so commonly
used, and it is likely that you will encounter them frequently. But that is not to indicate that I am
discouraging you using other systems. However, I strongly recommend that you stick with widely
used, well-supported antivirus products.

CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software182
Firewalls
A firewall is, in essence, a barrier between your network and the outside world. At a minimum, it will
filter incoming packets based on certain parameters such as packet size, source IP address, protocol,
and destination port. Linux and Windows (beginning with Windows XP and in all subsequent Windows
versions) ship with a simple firewall. For Windows, the firewall in Windows 7 was expanded to handle
filtering both inbound and outbound traffic.
In an organizational setting, you will want a dedicated firewall between your network and the outside
world. This might be a router that also has built-in firewall capabilities. (Cisco Systems is one company
that is well known for high-quality routers and firewalls.) Or, it might be a server that is dedicated
solely to running firewall software. Selecting a firewall, however, is an important decision. If you lack
the expertise to make that decision, then you should arrange for a consultant to assist you in this
respect.
Benefits and Limitation of Firewalls
A firewall, no matter what type you get (types are described in the next section), is basically a tool to
block certain traffic. A set of rules determine what traffic to allow in, and what traffic to block. Obvi-
ously, a firewall is a critical piece of your security strategy. I cannot even conceive of any reason to run
any system without one. However, it is not a panacea for security. It cannot block every attack. For
example, a firewall won’t stop you from downloading a Trojan horse. It also cannot stop internal
attacks. But a firewall can be an excellent way to stop a denial of service attack or to prevent a hacker
from scanning the internal details of your network.
Firewall Types and Components
Up to this point, most discussion of firewalls has focused on packet-filtering firewalls. However, there
are several other types of firewalls or components to firewalls that are listed below.
■ Screening firewall
■ Application gateway
■ Circuit-level gateway
The following sections will discuss each of these and assess the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Screening Firewall
Screening firewalls, the most basic type of firewall, are simply another name for packet-filtering fire-
walls. This type of firewall works in the network layer of the OSI model (see Chapter 2, “Networks and
the Internet”). It simply examines incoming packets and either allows or denies them entrance based on
a set of rules that were put into its configuration. They can filter packets based on packet size, protocol
type used, destination IP address, source IP address, destination port, source port, and so forth. For
ptg999
Firewalls 183
example, a packet filter might deny all traffic on ports 1024 and up, or it might block all incoming
traffic using the TFTP protocol. You can use incoming and outgoing filters to dictate what information
passes into or out of your local network.
Many routers offer this type of firewall option. These firewalls are usually very easy to configure and
quite inexpensive. As mentioned, some operating systems include built-in packet-filtering capabilities.
There are a few disadvantages to the screening/packet-filtering firewall solution. One disadvantage is
that they do not actually examine the packet or compare it to previous packets; therefore, they are quite
susceptible to either a ping flood or SYN flood. They also do not offer any user authentication. Addi-
tionally, in many cases, a packet-filtering firewall will be used as a bastion host. A bastion host is a
single point of contact between the Internet and a private network. It usually will only run a limited
number of services (those that are absolutely essential to the private network) and no others.
Application Gateway
An application gateway (also known as application proxy or application-level proxy) is a program that
runs on a firewall. When a client program, such as a Web browser, establishes a connection to a desti-
nation service, such as a web server, it connects to an application gateway, or proxy. The client then
negotiates with the proxy server in order to gain access to the destination service. In effect, the proxy
establishes the connection with the destination behind the firewall and acts on behalf of the client,
hiding and protecting individual computers on the network behind the firewall. This process actually
creates two connections. There is one connection between the client and the proxy server and another
connection between the proxy server and the destination.
Once a connection is established, the application gateway makes all decisions about which packets to
forward. Since all communication is conducted through the proxy server, computers behind the
firewall are protected.
With an application gateway, each supported client program requires a unique program to accept client
application data. This sort of firewall allows for individual user authentication, which makes them
quite effective at blocking unwanted traffic. However, a disadvantage is that these firewalls use a lot of
system resources and are susceptible to SYN floods and ping floods.
Circuit-Level Gateway
A circuit-level gateway is similar to an application gateway but is more secure and generally imple-
mented on high-end equipment. A circuit-level gateway relays a TCP connection but does no addi-
tional processing or filtering of the protocol (Wack, 1995). In this system, your username is checked
and granted access before the connection to the router is established. This means that you as an indi-
vidual, either by username or IP address, must be verified before any further communication can take
place. Once this verification takes place and the connection between the source and destination is
established, the firewall simply passes bytes between the systems. A virtual “circuit” exists between
the internal client and the proxy server. Internet requests go through this circuit to the proxy server, and
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software184
the proxy server delivers those requests to the Internet after changing the IP address. External users
only see the IP address of the proxy server. Responses are then received by the proxy server and sent
back through the circuit to the client. While traffic is allowed through, external systems never see the
internal systems.
While highly secure, this approach may not be appropriate for some public situations, such as e-commerce
sites. This type of firewall does not allow features, such as URL filtering. They also frequently offer only
limited auditing capabilities.
How Firewalls Examine Packets
In addition to how the firewall operates, you can further differentiate firewalls based on how they
examine incoming packets. There are two main approaches to this task, and each is briefly examined
below.
Stateful Packet Inspection
The stateful packet inspection (SPI) firewall will examine each packet, denying or permitting access
based not only on the examination of the current packet, but also on data derived from previous packets
in the conversation. This means that the firewall is aware of the context in which a specific packet was
sent. This makes these firewalls far less susceptible to ping floods and SYN floods, as well as being
less susceptible to spoofing. For example, if the firewall detects that the current packet is an ICMP
packet and a stream of several thousand packets have been continuously coming from the same source
IP, it is clearly a denial of service attack and the packets will be blocked.
The SPI firewall can also look at the actual contents of the packet. This allows for some very advanced
filtering capabilities. Most high-end firewalls use the stateful packet inspection method; when possible,
this is the recommended type of firewall.
Stateless Packet Inspection
Stateless packet inspection does not involve actually examining the contents of each packet, which is a
significant weakness in using such an inspection technology. Also, the stateless packet inspection does
not examine a packet within the context of an ongoing TCP conversation. It does not know what the
preceding or subsequent packets are doing, thus making it vulnerable to ping floods and other denial of
service attacks.
Firewall Configurations
In addition to the various types of firewalls, there are also various configuration options. The type of
firewall tells you how it will evaluate traffic and hence decide what to allow and not to allow. The
configuration gives you an idea of how that firewall is set up in relation to the network it is protecting.
Some of the major configurations/implementations for firewalls include the following:
ptg999
Firewalls 185
■ Network host-based
■ Dual-homed host
■ Router-based firewall
■ Screened host
Each of these is discussed in the following sections.
Network Host-Based
A network host-based firewall is a software solution installed on an existing machine with an existing
operating system. The most significant concern in using this type of firewall is that no matter how good
the firewall solution is, it is contingent upon the underlying operating system. In such a situation, it is
absolutely critical that the machine hosting the firewall have a hardened operating system.
Dual-Homed Host
A dual-homed host is a firewall running on a server with at least two network interfaces. The server acts
as a router between the network and the interfaces to which it is attached. To make this work, the auto-
matic routing function is disabled, meaning that an IP packet from the Internet is not routed directly to the
network. You can choose what packets to route and how to route them. Systems inside and outside the
firewall can communicate with the dual-homed host but cannot communicate directly with each other.
Router-Based Firewall
As was previously mentioned, you can implement firewall protection on a router. In larger networks
with multiple layers of protection, this is commonly the first layer of protection. Although one can
implement various types of firewalls on a router, the most common type used is packet filtering. If you
use a broadband connection in your home or small office, you can get a packet-filtering firewall router
to replace the basic router provided to you by the broadband company. In recent years, router-based
firewalls have become increasingly common and are in fact the most common firewall used today.
Screened Host
A screened host is really a combination of firewalls. In this configuration, you use a combination of a
bastion host and a screening router. The screening router adds security by allowing you to deny or
permit certain traffic from the bastion host. It is the first stop for traffic, which can continue only if the
screening router lets it through.
Commercial and Free Firewall Products
There is a variety of commercial firewall products from which you can choose. If all you want is a
basic packet-filtering solution, many software vendors offer this. Major antivirus software vendors
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software186
(including those mentioned previously in this chapter) often offer the firewall software as a bundled
option with their antivirus software. Other companies, such as Zone Labs, sell firewall and intrusion-
detection software. Zone Labs, for example, offers the ZoneAlarm Security Suite, which provides all
the tools for complete Internet security. Major manufacturers of routers and hubs, such as Cisco
Systems, also offer firewall products. How much security you need is a difficult question to answer. A
bare minimum recommendation is to have a packet-filtering firewall/proxy server between your
network and the Internet—but that is a bare minimum. There are also many free firewall applications
available. Zone Labs, mentioned above for their commercial product, also offers a free download of the
ZoneAlarm firewall protection.
Outpost Firewall, available from www.agnitum.com/products/outpost/, is a product designed for the
home or small office user. Like the Zone Labs product, it has both a free version and an enhanced
commercial version. Information on this product is shown in Figure 9.1. Note that the free version is an
older version of the software and does not include many of the enhancements of the commercial
version. But it may be sufficient for your needs.
FIGURE 9.1 Firewall protection from Agnitum.
Listed and shown below are a number of other sources for information on free firewall protection.
Each of these websites offers links to a number of sources for free firewall protection as well as to
other useful security tools. You may want to explore these sites as well as add them to your list of
resource sites:

■ www.firewallguide.com/freeware.htm
Firewall Logs
Firewalls are also excellent tools when attempting to ascertain what has happened after an incident
occurs. Almost all firewalls, regardless of type or implementation, will log activity. These logs can
provide valuable information that can assist in determining the source of an attack, methods used to
attack, and other data that might help either locate the perpetrator of an attack or at least prevent a
future attack using the same techniques. Any security-conscious network administrator should make it
a routine habit to check the firewall logs.
Antispyware
Antispyware, as discussed earlier in this book, scans your computer to see whether there is spyware
running on your machine. This is an important element of computer security software that was at one
time largely ignored. Even today, not enough people take spyware seriously or guard against it. Most
antispyware works by checking your system for known spyware files. Each application must simply be
checked against a list of known spyware. This means that you must maintain some sort of subscription
service so that you can obtain routine updates to your spyware definition list. Most antivirus solutions
now also check for antispyware.
In today’s Internet climate, running antispyware is as essential as running antivirus software. Failing to
do so can lead to serious consequences. Personal data, and perhaps sensitive business data, could easily
be leaking out of your organization without your knowledge. And, as was pointed out earlier in this
book, it is entirely possible for spyware to be the vehicle for purposeful industrial espionage.
Barring the use of antispyware, or even in conjunction with such software, you can also protect yourself
via your browser’s security settings as was discussed in a previous chapter. Additionally, several times
throughout this book, you have been warned to be cautious about attachments and Internet downloads.
You would also be well advised to avoid downloading various Internet “enhancements,” such as “skins”
and “toolbars.” If you are in an organization, prohibiting such downloads should be a matter of company
policy. Unfortunately, many websites today require some sort of add-in such as Flash in order to
function properly. The best advice for this situation is to only allow add-ins on trusted, well-known sites.
Intrusion-Detection Software
Intrusion-detection software (IDS) has become much more widely used in the last few years. Essen-
tially, an IDS will inspect all inbound and outbound port activity on your machine/firewall/system and
look for patterns that might indicate an attempted break-in. For example, if the IDS finds that a series
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software188
of ICMP packets were sent to each port in sequence, this probably indicates that your system is being
scanned by network-scanning software, such as Cerberus. Since this is often a prelude to an attempt to
breach your system security, it can be very important to know that someone is performing preparatory
steps to infiltrate your system.
Entire volumes have been written on how IDS systems work. This chapter cannot hope to cover that
much information. However, it is important that you have a basic idea of how these systems work.
The sections below will first examine the broad categories in which IDS systems tend to be viewed and
then will also look at some specific approaches to IDS. While this information is not all inclusive, it
does address the more common terminology used.
IDS Categorization
There are a number of ways in which IDS systems can be categorized. The most common IDS catego-
rizations are as follows:
■ Misuse detection versus anomaly detection
■ Passive systems versus reactive systems
■ Network-based systems versus host-based systems
Misuse Detection vs. Anomaly Detection
An IDS that uses misuse detection analyzes the information it gathers and compares it to large data-
bases of attack signatures (IDS signatures) (Webopedia, 2004). Much like a virus-detection system,
this form of IDS looks for specific attacks that have already been documented. However, similar to
virus scanners, this form of IDS is only as good as the IDS signatures against which it compares the
packets.
On the other hand, anomaly detection involves actual software that works to detect intrusion attempts
and notify the administrator. This is what many people think of when they talk about intrusion-
detection systems. The general process is simple: The system looks for any anomalous behavior. Any
activity that does not match the pattern of normal user access is noted and logged. The software
compares observed activity against expected normal usage profiles. Profiles are usually developed for
specific users, groups of users, or applications. Any activity that does not match the definition of
normal behavior is considered an anomaly and is logged.
Passive Systems Versus Reactive Systems
In a passive system, the IDS detects a potential security breach, logs the information, and signals an
alert. In a reactive system, the IDS responds to the suspicious activity by logging off a user or repro-
gramming the firewall to block network traffic from the suspected malicious source (Webopedia, 2011).
ptg999
Intrusion-Detection Software 189
Network-Based System Versus Host-Based System
In a network-based system (NIDS), the individual packets flowing through a network are analyzed.
This system can detect malicious packets that are designed to be overlooked by a firewall’s simplistic
filtering rules (Webopedia, 2004). In a host-based system (HIDS), the activity of each individual
computer or host is examined.
FYI: Normal Activity Patterns
With anomaly-based IDS, it can take some time to create what is considered “normal” activity
patterns. While these activity patterns are being established, you may experience a high rate of
false alarms.
You should also note that, if the network already contains malicious code, then the activity of this
code would be considered normal.
IDS Approaches
There are many approaches to detection and prevention. Some of these methods are implemented in
various software packages, while others are simply strategies that an organization can employ to
decrease the likelihood of a successful intrusion.
Preemptive Blocking
This approach, sometimes called banishment vigilance, seeks to prevent intrusions before they occur.
This is done by noting any danger signs of impending threats and then blocking the user or IP address
from which these signs originate. Examples of this technique include attempting to detect the early
foot printing stages of an impending intrusion, then blocking the IP or user that is the source of the foot
printing activity. If you find that a particular IP address is the source of frequent port scans and other
scans of your system, then you would block that IP address at the firewall.
This sort of intrusion detection and avoidance can be complicated. Usually, a software system will simply
alert the administrator that suspicious activity has taken place. A human administrator will then make the
decision whether or not to block the person. If the software automatically blocks any addresses it deems
suspicious, you run the risk of blocking out legitimate users. It should also be noted that nothing prevents
the offending user from moving to a different machine to continue their attack. This sort of approach
should only be one part of an overall intrusion-detection strategy and not the entire strategy.
Snort
There are a number of vendors who supply IDS systems, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
Which system is best for your environment is contingent on many factors including the network 
environment, security level required, budget constraints, and the skill level of the person who will be
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software190
working directly with the IDS. One popular open-source IDS is Snort, which can be downloaded for
free from www.snort.org/.
We will examine Snort briefly in this section. While it is not the only IDS available, it is free, and that
makes it an attractive option for many people. We will walk through the basic configuration of Snort
for Windows. 
First you must visit www.snort.org and register. It is free. Then download the Snort installation program
and the latest rules. Make certain you download the installer that has a .exe extension. The .rpm extensions
are for Linux. Also, I have found that certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer do not work well with
the Snort website, so it is recommended that you use an alternative browser such as Mozilla Firefox. 
Once you have downloaded both the rules and the installation, start the installation. Most of it is quite
simple. There is a screen that asks you if you wish to support database connectivity. For most live situ-
ations you would want to dump your Snort records to some database. However, for demonstration
purposes choose “I do not plan to log to a database,” as shown in Figure 9.2.
FIGURE 9.2 Snort database selection.
Other than this, simply use all default settings. At the end of the install, it will also attempt to install
WinPCAP. If for some reason this fails, you will need to download and install it separately. WinPCAP is
an open source tool for capturing packets. All intrusion-detection systems depend on packet capturing.
Now copy rules you downloaded from wherever you saved them to c:\snort\rules. Then you need to
copy the configuration file from c:\snort\rules\etc\snort.conf to C:\snort\etc. Now open that configu-
ration file using WordPad, not Notepad. Notepad does not support word wrap, and it will be difficult to
read the configuration file in Notepad.
The first step is to change the HOME_NET any to your machines IP address, as shown in Figure 9.3.
In a live situation, we would also set the other IP addresses (web server, SQL server, DNS server, etc.)
ptg999
Intrusion-Detection Software 191
FIGURE 9.3 HOME_NET address.
Now you need to find and change the rules paths. They will have Linux style paths, as shown in Figure 9.4.
FIGURE 9.4 Linux-style paths.
You will need to change them to Windows style paths, as shown in Figure 9.5.
FIGURE 9.5 Windows-style paths.
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software192
You will now need to find and change the library paths. This is a bit harder because the names of the
paths and the files are a bit different in Windows. The Linux style library paths will appear as the ones
shown in Figure 9.6.
FIGURE 9.6 Linux-style library paths.
You can find your Windows pathnames and filenames by looking in the folder shown in Figure 9.7.
FIGURE 9.7 Windows-style library paths.
Note: If you find that you do not have a particular file or path in your system, just make sure it is
commented out in the configuration file.
Now you must find the reference data and change it from Linux paths to Windows style paths as shown
in Figure 9.8.
FIGURE 9.8 Reference paths.
You are almost done. Now search for 
#output log_tcp dump
and after that put this line
output alert_fast: alert.ids
ptg999
Intrusion-Detection Software 193
Note: the pound sign (#) indicates a comment.
Now you will need to use the command line to start Snort. Simply navigate to c:\snort\bin. There are
several different ways to start Snort. Many of the common ones are shown here in Table 9.1. I
recommend you try the simplest first.
TABLE 9.1 Snort Commands
Command Purpose
snort –v Start Snort as just a packet sniffer
snort –vd Start Snort as a packet sniffer, but have it sniff packet data rather
than just the headers
snort -dev -l ./log Start Snort in logging mode so it logs packets
snort -dev -l ./log –h Start Snort in IDS mode
192.168.1.1/24 -c 
snort.conf (Put your IP 
address where you see italics.)
Snort is free and open source, but many people have a great deal of difficulty working with it the first
time. The slightest error in your configuration file or the command-line startup will cause it to not run
correctly. The purpose of this section is just to introduce you to Snort. For more information on Snort,
try the following:

Honey Pots
A honey pot is an interesting technology. Essentially, it assumes that an attacker is able to breach your
network security. And it would be best to distract that attacker away from your valuable data.
Therefore, one creates a server that has fake data. Perhaps an SQL server or Oracle server loaded with
fake data, and just a little less secure than your real servers. Then, since none of your actual users ever
access this server, monitoring software is installed to alert you when someone does access this server.
A honey pot achieves two goals. First, it will take the attacker’s attention away from the data you wish
to protect. Second, it will provide what appears to be interesting and valuable data, thus leading the
attacker to stay connected to the fake server, giving you time to try and track them. There are
commercial solutions, like Specter (www.specter.com/default50.htm). These solutions are usually
quite easy to set up and include monitoring/tracking software. You may also find it useful to check out
www.honeypots.org for more information on honey pots in general, and on specific implementations.
ptg999
CHAPTER 9 Computer Security Software194
Other Preemptive Techniques
Besides IDS, antivirus, firewalls, and honey pots, there are a variety of preemptive techniques an
administrator can use to attempt to reduce the chances of a successful attack being executed against his
or her network.
Intrusion Deflection
This method is becoming increasingly popular among the more security-conscious administrators. The
essence of it is quite simple. An attempt is made to attract the intruder to a subsystem set up for the
purpose of observing him. This is done by tricking the intruder into believing that he has succeeded in
accessing system resources when, in fact, he has been directed to a specially designed environment.
Being able to observe the intruder while he practices his art will yield valuable clues and can lead to his
arrest.
This is often done by using what is commonly referred to as a honey pot. Essentially, you set up a fake
system, possibly a server that appears to be an entire subnet. You make that system look very attractive
by perhaps making it appear to have sensitive data, such as personnel files, or valuable data, such as
account numbers or research. The actual data stored in this system is fake. The real purpose of the
system is to carefully monitor the activities of any person who accesses the system. Since no legitimate
user ever accesses this system, it is a given that anyone accessing it is an intruder. 
Infiltration
This method refers to efforts on the part of the administrator or security specialist to acquire infor-
mation from various illicit sources. Many administrators rely solely on various security bulletins from
vendors. With infiltration, the administrator proactively seeks out intelligence on potential
threats/groups. In other words, it is not a software or hardware implementation, but rather a process of
infiltrating hacker/cracker online groups in order to keep tabs on what sort of vulnerabilities are
currently being exploited by these groups and what target systems are considered attractive targets.
This form of intrusion detection is not widely used for two reasons. The first reason is that it is quite
time-consuming. The second reason is that it requires spying skills, which many administrators may
not possess.
Intrusion Deterrence
This method involves simply trying to make the system seem like a less-palatable target. In short, an
attempt is made to make any potential reward from a successful intrusion attempt appear more difficult
than it is worth. This approach includes tactics such as attempting to reduce the apparent value of the
current system’s worth through camouflage. This essentially means working to hide the most valuable
aspects of the system. The other tactic in this methodology involves raising the perceived risk of a
potential intruder being caught. This can be done in a variety of ways, including conspicuously
displaying warnings and warning of active monitoring. The perception of the security of a system can
be drastically improved, even when the actual system security has not been improved.

Summary
It is absolutely critical that any network have a firewall and proxy server between the network and the
outside world. It is critical that all machines in the network (servers and workstations alike) have
updated virus protection. It is also a good idea to consider intrusion-detection software and anti-
spyware, as well. In the upcoming exercises, you will have an opportunity to practice setting up various
types of firewalls and IDS systems.

Security Policies
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Recognize the importance of security policies.
■ Understand the various policies and the rationale for them.
■ Know what elements go into good policies.
■ Create policies for network administration.
■ Evaluate and improve existing policies.
Introduction
So far in this book we have explored various threats to networks. And in Chapter 9, “Computer
Security Software,” we examined a variety of technical defenses against such attacks. However, the
fact is that technology by itself cannot solve all network security problems. There are some issues that
technology cannot stop. Examples of this include the following:
■ Virus software won’t prevent a user from manually opening an attachment and releasing a
virus.
■ A technologically secured network is still very vulnerable if former employees (perhaps some
unhappy with the company) still have working passwords. Or if passwords are simply put on
Post-it notes on computer monitors.
■ A server is not secure if it is in a room that nearly everyone in the company has access to.
■ Your network is not secure if end users are vulnerable to social engineering.
Chapter 10
200
ptg999
Defining User Policies 201
Another reason that technology alone is not the answer is that technology must be appropriately
applied. Policies are used to guide you in how to implement and manage security, including security
technology. In this chapter, we will examine computer security policies, including the elements that go
into creating good security policies as well as examples of how to establish a network security policy.
What Is a Policy
A security policy is a document that defines how an organization will deal with some aspect of
security. There can be policies regarding end-user behavior, IT response to incidents, or policies for
specific issues and incidents.
Security policies can also be created to deal with regulatory requirements. These types of policies
direct members of the organization as to how to comply with certain regulations. A good example
would be a policy informing healthcare workers how to comply with HIPAA when using electronic
medical records software.
Or policies can simply be advisory, advising employees how they should handle certain items, but not
requiring compliance. For example a policy might advise users that emailing from a smart phone using
a WiFi hotspot can be unsecure, but not forbid it.
Defining User Policies
When discussing user policies, there is one rule you must keep in mind: You should have a policy for
every foreseeable situation. Failure to have policies that address a given problem will usually result in
that problem being exacerbated. Something may seem like common sense to you, but may not be to
someone with no training or experience in computer networks or network security.
The misuse of systems is a major problem for many organizations. A large part of the problem comes
from the difficulty in defining exactly what is misuse. Some things might be obvious misuse, such as
using company time and computers to search for another job or to view illicit websites. However, other
areas are not so clear, such as an employee using her lunchtime to look up information about a car she
is thinking of buying. Generally, good user policies will outline specifically how people are to use the
system and how they should not. For a policy to be effective, it needs to be very clear and quite
specific. Vague statements such as “computers and Internet access are only for business use” are
simply inadequate. I would recommend something more clear and perhaps more enforceable, perhaps
something like “computers and Internet access are only for business purposes during business hours.
However, employees may use the computer/Internet access for personal use during nonwork time such
as breaks, lunch, and before work. However, such use must be in compliance with Internet usage
policies.” That is clear, direct, and also enforceable.
Other areas for potential misuse are also covered by user policies, including password sharing, copying
data, leaving accounts logged on while employees go to lunch, etc. All of these issues ultimately have
a significant impact on your network’s security and must be clearly spelled out in your user policies.
We will now examine several areas that effective user policies must cover:
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies202
■ Passwords
■ Internet use
■ Email attachments
■ Installing/uninstalling software
■ Instant messaging
■ Desktop configuration
Passwords
Keeping passwords secure is critical. In Chapter 8, “Encryption,” appropriate passwords were
discussed as part of operating system hardening. A good password is at least eight characters long, uses
numbers and special characters, and has no obvious relevance to the end user. For example, a Dallas
Cowboys fan would be ill advised to use a password like cowboys or godallas, but might be well
advised to use a password such as %trEe987 or 123DoG$$, since those don’t reflect the person’s
personal interests and therefore would not be easily guessed. Issues such as minimum password length,
password history, and password complexity come under administrative policies, not user policies. User
policies dictate how the end user should behave. For reliable security, I recommend a passphrase that
has been altered to include numbers and special characters. This can be something easy to remember
but altered so that it will not be vulnerable to guessing or brute-force attacks. An example would be
taking the phrase “I like double cheese burgers” and altering it to be IliK3double3ch33$eburg3r$.
Notice the e’s were changed to 3’s, the s’s to $’s and two random letters were capitalized. You now have
a 25-character password that is also complex. It is easy to remember and very difficult to break.
However, no password is secure, no matter how long or how complex, if it is listed on a sticky note
stuck to the user’s computer monitor. This may seem obvious, but it is not at all uncommon to go into
an office and find a password either on the monitor or in the top drawer of the desk. Every janitor or
anyone who simply passes by the office can get that password. 
It is also not uncommon to find employees sharing passwords. For example, Bob is going to be out of
town next week, so he gives Juan his password so that Juan can get into his system, check email, etc.
The problem is that now two people have that password. And what happens if during the week Bob is
gone, Juan gets ill and decides he will share the password with Shelly so that she can keep checking
that system while Juan is out sick? It does not take long for a password to get to so many people that it
is not longer useful at all from a security perspective. 
Issues like minimum length of passwords, password age, and password history are issues of adminis-
trative policies. System administrators can force these requirements. However, none of that will be
particularly helpful if the users don’t manage their passwords in a secure fashion.
All of this means you need explicit policies regarding how users secure their passwords. Those policies
should specify the following:
ptg999
Defining User Policies 203
■ Passwords are never to be kept written down in any accessible place. The preference is that they
not be written down at all, but if they are, they should be in a secure area such as a lock box at
your home (i.e., not in the office right next to your computer).
■ Passwords must never be shared with any person for any reason.
■ If an employee believes his password has been compromised, he should immediately contact
the IT department so his password can be changed and so that logon attempts with the old pass-
word can be monitored and traced.
Internet Use
Most organizations provide their users with some sort of Internet access. There are several reasons for
this. The most obvious reason is email. However, that is hardly the only reason to have Internet access
in a business or academic setting. There is also the Web, and even chat rooms (believe it or not, they
can, and in some cases are being used for business communications). All of which can be used for
legitimate purposes within any organization, but can also be serious security problems. Appropriate
polices must be in place to govern the use of these technologies.
The World Wide Web is a wonderful resource for a tremendous wealth of data. Throughout this book,
we have frequently referenced websites where one can find valuable security data and useful utilities.
The Internet is also replete with useful tutorials on various technologies. However, even non-tech-
nology-related business interests can be served via the Web. Here are a few examples of legitimate
business uses of the Web:
■ Sales staff checking competitor’s websites to see what products or services they offer, in what
areas, perhaps even getting prices
■ Creditors checking businesses AM Best or Standard and Poor’s rating to see how their business
financial rating is doing
■ Business travelers checking weather conditions, and getting prices for travel
■ Online training with webinars
■ Web meetings
■ Online bill payment or in some cases even filing regulatory and government documents
Of course, there are other web activities that are clearly not appropriate on a company’s network:
■ Using the Web to search for a new job
■ Any pornographic use
■ Any use which violates local, state, or federal laws
■ Use of the Web to conduct your own business (i.e., you have another enterprise you are 
involved in other than the company’s business)
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies204
In addition, there are gray areas. Some activities might be acceptable to some organizations, but not to
others. Such activities might include
■ Online shopping during the employee’s lunch or break time
■ Reading news articles online during lunch or break time
■ Viewing humorous websites
What one person might view as absurdly obvious might not be to another. It is critical that any organi-
zation have very clear policies detailing specifically what is and what is not acceptable use of the Web
at work. Giving clear examples of what is acceptable use and what is not is also important. You should
also remember that most proxy servers and many firewalls can block certain websites. This will help
prevent employees from misusing the company’s web connection.
Email Usage
Most business and even academic activity now occurs via email. As we have discussed in several
previous chapters, email also happens to be the primary vehicle for virus distribution. This means that
email security is a significant issue for any network administrator. 
Clearly you cannot simply ban all email attachments. However, you can establish some guidelines for
how to handle email attachments. Users should only open an attachment if it meets the following criteria:
■ It was expected (i.e., they requested documents from some colleague or client).
■ If it was not expected, did it come from a known source? If so first send that person an email
(or phone them) and ask if they sent the attachment. If so open it.
■ It appears to be a legitimate business document (i.e., a spreadsheet, a document, a presentation,
etc.).
It should be noted that some people might find such criteria unrealistic. There is no question they are
inconvenient. However, with the prevalence of viruses, often attached to email, these measures are
prudent. Many people choose not to go to this level to try and avoid viruses, and that may be your
choice as well. Just bear in mind that millions of computers are infected with some sort of virus every
single year.
No one should ever open an attachment that meets any of the following criteria:
■ It comes from an unknown source.
■ It is some active code or executable.
■ It is an animation/movie.
■ The email itself does not appear legitimate. (It seems to entice you to open the attachment, rather
than simply being a legitimate business communication that happens to have an attachment.)
ptg999
Defining User Policies 205
If the end user has any doubt whatsoever, then she should not open the email. Rather, she should
contact someone in the IT department who has been designated to handle security. That person can
then either compare the email subject line to known viruses or can simply come check out the email
personally. Then if it appears legitimate the user can open the attachment.
FYI: About Attachments
The author of this book frequently follows “better safe than sorry” axiom on this matter. This
means that when forwarded some joke, image, flash animation, etc. circulating the Internet, I
simply delete it. That may mean that I will miss many humorous images and stories, but it also
means I will miss many viruses. You would do well to consider emulating this practice.
Installing/Uninstalling Software
This is one matter that does have an absolute answer. End users should not be allowed to install
anything on their machine. This includes wallpapers, screensavers, utilities—anything. The best
approach is to limit their login privileges so that they cannot install anything. However, this should be
coupled with a strong policy statement prohibiting the installation of anything on their PC. If they wish
to install something, it should first be scanned by the IT department and approved. This process might
be cumbersome but it is necessary. Some organizations go so far as to remove or at least disable media
drives (CD, floppy, USB, etc.) from end-user PCs, so installations can only occur from files that the IT
department has put on some network drive. This is usually a more extreme measure than most organi-
zations will require but it is an option you should be aware of. In fact, Windows allows the adminis-
trator to disable allowing new USB devices. So the admin can install some USB devices that are
approved for corporate use, then disallow any additional devices being added.
Instant Messaging
Instant messaging is also widely used and abused by employees in companies and organizations. In
some cases, instant messaging can be used for legitimate business purposes. However, it does pose a
significant security risk. There have been viruses which specifically propagated via instant messaging.
In one incident, the virus would copy everyone on the user’s buddy list with the contents of all conver-
sations. Thus a conversation you thought was private was being broadcast to everyone you knew and
had messaged with.
Instant messaging is also a threat from a purely informational security perspective. Nothing stops an
end user from instant messaging out trade secrets, or confidential information, without the traceability
of email going through the corporate email server. It is recommended that instant messaging simply be
banned from all computers within an organization. If you find you absolutely must have it, then you
must establish very strict guidelines for its use, including the following:
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies206
■ Instant messaging can only be used for business communications, no personal conversations.
Now this might be a bit difficult to enforce. Rules like this often are. More common rules, such
as prohibiting personal web browsing, are also quite difficult to enforce. However it is still a
good idea to have those rules in place. Then if you find a person violating them, you do have a
company policy that you can refer to that prohibits such actions. However, you should be aware
that in all likelihood you won’t catch most violations of this rule.
■ No confidential or private business information should be sent via instant messaging.
Desktop Configuration
Many users like to reconfigure their desktop. This means changing the background, screensaver, font
size, resolution, etc. Theoretically speaking, this is not a security hazard. Simply changing your
computer’s background image cannot compromise your computer’s security. However, there are other
issues involved.
The first issue is where the background image comes from. Frequently, end users will download
images from the Internet. This means there is a chance of getting a virus or Trojan horse, particularly
one using a hidden extension (i.e., it appears to be a mypic.jpg but is really mypic.jpg.exe). There are
also human resources/harassment issues if an employee uses a backdrop or screensaver that is
offensive to other employees. Some organizations simply decide to prohibit any changes to the system
configuration for this reason.
The second problem is technical. In order to give a user access to change screensavers, background
images, and resolution, you must give them rights which will also allow them to change other system
settings you might not want changed. The graphical display options are not separated from all other
configuration options. This means that allowing the user to change their screensaver might open the
door for them to alter other settings (such as the network card configuration or the Windows Internet
Connection Firewall) that would compromise security.
Final Thoughts on User Policies
This section has provided an overview of appropriate and effective user policies. It is critical that any
organization implement solid user policies. However, these policies will not be effective unless you
have clearly defined consequences for violating them. Many organizations find it helpful to spell out
specific consequences that escalate with each incident, such as the following:
■ The first incident of violating any of these policies will result in a verbal warning.
■ A second incident will result in a written warning. 
■ The third incident will result in suspension or termination. (In the case of academic settings,
this would be suspension or expulsion.)
ptg999
Defining System Administration Policies 207
You must clearly list the consequences, and all users should sign a copy of the user policies upon being
hired. This prevents anyone claiming they where not aware of the policies. 
CAUTION
Termination or Expulsion
Any policy which can lead to expulsion from a school or termination from a job (or even a
demotion) should first be cleared by your legal advisor. There can be significant legal ramifications
for wrongful termination or expulsion. The author of this book is not an attorney, nor an expert in
legal matters, and cannot provide you with legal advice. It is imperative that you do consult an
attorney about these matters.
It is also important to realize that there is another cost to misuse of corporate Internet access. That cost
is lost productivity. How much time does the average employee spend reading personal email, doing
nonbusiness web activities, or instant messaging? It is hard to say. However, for an informal view, go
to www.yahoo.com on any given business day, during business hours, and click on one of the news
stories. At the bottom of the story you will see a message board for this story. It lists date and time of
posts. See how many posts are done during business hours. It is unlikely that all of those people are out
of work, retired, or at home sick.
Let us be completely clear. The Internet is the single greatest communication tool in human history.
And it can have a tremendous positive effect on any business. I personally conduct almost all of my
business activities through the Web. However, many employees do abuse the Internet, and it does
decrease productivity for those who cannot be self-disciplined. Here are just a few studies supporting
this assertion:
■ A 2008 study showed employees wasting an average of 5.3 hours a week on idle Internet surfing.
■ Ohio State University researchers found regular Facebook users had a lower GPA than nonusers
(http://redandblack.com/2009/04/29/social-networking-decreases-productivity/)
■ A 2010 study showed allowing Facebook access on the business network lead to a 1.5% loss in
overall productivity. Some employees admitted to spending as much as 2 hours per day on
Facebook while at work (www.techjournalsouth.com/2010/08/social-networking-at-work-leads-
to-productivity-loss/).
Defining System Administration Policies
In addition to determining policies for users, you must have some clearly defined policies for system
administrators. There must be a procedure for adding users, removing users, dealing with security
issues, changing any system, etc. There must also be standards for handling any deviation.
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies208
New Employees
When a new employee is hired, the system administration policy must define specific steps to safe-
guard company security. New employees must be given access to the resources and applications their
job function requires. The granting of that access must be documented (possibly in a log). It is also
critical that the new employee receive a copy of the company’s computer security/acceptable use
polices and sign a document acknowledging receipt of such.
Before a new employee starts to work, the IT department (specifically network administration) should
receive a written request from the business unit that person will be working for. That request should
specify exactly what resources this user will need, when she will start, and have the signature of
someone in the business unit with authority to approve such a request. Then the person who is
managing network administration or network security should approve and sign the request. After you
have implemented the new user on the system with the appropriate rights, you can file a copy of the
request.
Departing Employees
When an employee leaves, it is critical to make sure all of his logins are terminated and all access to all
systems is discontinued immediately. Unfortunately, this is an area of security that all too many organ-
izations do not give enough attention to. When an employee leaves, you cannot be certain which
employee will bear the company ill will, and which won’t. It is imperative to have all of the former
employee’s access shut down on his last day of work. This includes physical access to the building. If
a former employee has keys and is disgruntled, nothing can stop him from returning to steal or
vandalize computer equipment. When an employee leaves the company, you need to ensure that on his
last day the following actions take place:
■ All logon accounts to any server, VPN, network, or other resource are disabled.
■ All keys to the facility are returned.
■ All accounts for email, Internet access, wireless Internet, cell phones, etc. are shut off.
■ Any accounts for mainframe resources are canceled.
■ The employee’s workstation hard drive is searched.
The last item might seem odd. But if an employee was gathering data to take with him (proprietary
company data) or conducting any other improper activities, you need to find out right away. If you do
see any evidence of any such activity, you need to secure that workstation and keep it for evidence in
any civil or criminal proceedings.
All of this might seem a bit extreme to some readers. It is true that with the vast majority of exiting
employees you will have no issues to be concerned about. However, if you do not make it a habit of
securing an employee’s access when they depart, you will eventually have an unfortunate situation that
could have been easily avoided.
ptg999
Defining System Administration Policies 209
Change Requests
The nature of IT is change. Not only do end users come and go, but requirements change frequently.
Business units request access to different resources, server administrators upgrade software and
hardware, application developers install new software, web developers change the website, etc. Change
is occurring all the time. Therefore, it is important to have a change control process. This process not
only makes the change run smoothly, but allows the IT security personnel to examine the change for
any potential security problems, before it is implemented. A change control request should go through
the following steps:
■ An appropriate manager within the business unit signs, signifying approval of the request.
■ The appropriate IT unit (database administration, network admin, email admin, etc.) verifies
that the request is one they can fulfill (from both a technological and a budgetary/business
perspective).
■ The IT security unit verifies that this change will not cause any security problems.
■ The appropriate IT unit formulates a plan to implement the change and a plan to roll back the
change in the event of some failure.
■ The date and time for the change is scheduled, and all relevant parties are notified.
Your change control process might not be identical to this one; in fact, you might be much more
specific. However the key to remember is that in order for your network to be secure, you simply
cannot have changes happening without some process for examining the impact of those changes prior
to implementing them.
In Practice
Extremes of Change Control
Anyone with even a few years of experience in the IT profession can tell you that when it comes to
change control there are all sorts of different approaches. The real problem is those IT groups that
implement unreasonable extremes. This author has personally seen both. Without using the real
names of the companies involved, let’s examine a real case of each extreme.
Software consultants company X was a small company that did custom financial applications for
various companies. They had a staff of less than 20 developers, who frequently traveled to client
locations around the country. They literally had
■ No documentation for any of their applications, not even a few notes.
■ There was no change control process at all. When someone did not like a setting on a
server, or some part of the network configuration, they simply changed it.
■ There was no process for handling former employee access. In one case, a person had
been gone for six months and still had a valid logon account.
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies210
Now clearly this is alarming from several perspectives, not just from a security viewpoint.
However, that is one extreme, one that makes for a very chaotic environment that is very
unsecure. Security-minded network administrators tend to move toward the opposite extreme,
one which can have a negative impact on productivity.
Company B had over 2,000 employees, with an IT staff of about 100 people. In this company,
however, the bureaucracy had overwhelmed the IT department to the point that their productivity
was severely impacted. In one case, a person was a web server administrator and the decision
had been made that he also needed database administration rights on a single database server.
The process, however, took three months with one face-to-face meeting between his manager
and the CIO, as well as two phone conferences and a dozen emails between his manager and the
manager of the database group. 
The company’s convoluted change control process had a severely negative impact on produc-
tivity. Some employees informally estimated that even the low-level IT supervisors spent 40% of
their time in meetings/conferences, reporting on meetings/conferences, or preparing for
meetings/conferences. And the further one went up the IT ladder, the more one’s time became
consumed in bureaucratic activities. 
Both of these examples are meant to illustrate two extremes in change control management that
you should try to avoid. Your goal in implementing change control management is simply to have
an orderly and safe way of managing change, not to be an impediment to productivity.
Security Breaches
Unfortunately, the reality is that your network will probably, at some point, have a security breach of
some kind. This could mean that you are the target of a denial of service attack, your system is infected
with a virus, or perhaps a hacker gains entrance and destroys or copies sensitive data. You must have
some sort of plan for how to respond should any such event occur. This book cannot tell you specifi-
cally how to deal with each and every event that might occur; however, we can discuss some general
guidelines for what to do in certain, general, situations. We will look at each of the main types of
security breaches and what actions you should take for each. 
Virus Infection
■ When a virus strikes your system, immediately quarantine the infected machine or machines.
This means literally unplugging the machines from the network. If it is a subnet, then unplug
its switch and/or disconnect wireless access. Isolate the infected machines (unless your entire
network is infected, in which case simply shut down your router/ISP connection to close you
off from the outside world and prevent spread beyond your network). After implementing the
quarantine, you can safely take the following steps.
■ Scan and clean each and every infected machine. Since they are now off the network, this will
be a manual scan.
ptg999
Defining System Administration Policies 211
■ Log the incident, the hours/resources taken to clean the systems, and the systems which where
affected.
■ When you are certain the systems are clean, bring them online in stages (a few at a time). With
each stage, check all machines to see that they are patched, updated, and have properly
configured/running antivirus.
■ Notify the appropriate organization leaders of the event and the actions you have taken.
■ After you have dealt with the virus and notified the appropriate people, you should then have a
meeting with appropriate IT staff to discuss what can be learned from this breach, and how you
might prevent it from occurring in the future.
Denial of Service Attacks
■ If you have taken the steps outlined earlier in this book (such as properly configuring your
router and your firewall to reduce the impact of any attempted DoS), then you will already be
alleviating some of the damage from this type of attack. Use your firewall logs or IDS to find
out which IP address (or addresses) originated the attacks. Note the IP addresses, then (if your
firewall supports this feature, and most do) deny that IP address access to your network.
■ Use online resources (interNIC.net, etc.) to find out who the address belongs to. 
■ Contact that organization and inform them of what is occurring.
■ Log all of these activities and inform the appropriate organizational leaders.
■ After you have dealt with the DoS and notified the appropriate people, you should then have a
meeting with appropriate IT staff to discuss what can be learned from this attack, and how you
might prevent it from occurring in the future.
Intrusion by a Hacker
■ Immediately copy the logs of all affected systems (firewall, targeted servers, etc.) for use as 
evidence.
■ Immediately scan all systems for Trojan horses, changes to firewall settings, changes to port
filtering, new services running, etc. In essence, you are performing an emergency audit to see
what damage has been done.
■ Document everything. Of all of your documentation, this must be the most thorough. You must
specify which IT personnel took what actions at what times. Some of this data may be part of
later court proceedings, so absolute accuracy is necessary. It is probably a good idea to log all
activities taken during this time and to have at least two people verify and sign the log.
■ Change all affected passwords. Repair any damage done.
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies212
■ Inform the appropriate business leaders of what has happened.
■ After you have dealt with the breach and notified the appropriate people, you should then have
a meeting with appropriate IT staff to discuss what can be learned from this breach and how
you might prevent it from occurring in the future.
These are just general guidelines, and some organizations may have much more specific actions they
want taken in the event of some security breach. You should also bear in mind that throughout this book
when we have discussed various sorts of threats to network security we have mentioned particular steps
and policies that should be taken. The policies in this chapter are meant to be in addition to any already
outlined in this book. It is an unfortunate fact that some organizations have no plan for what to do in
case of an emergency. It is important that you do have at least some generalized procedures you can
implement.
Defining Access Control
An important area of security policies that usually generates some controversy in any organization is
access control. There is always a conflict between users’ desire for unfettered access to any data or
resources on the network and the security administrator’s desire to protect that data and resources. This
means that extremes in policies are not practical. You cannot simply lock down every resource as
completely as possible, since that would impede the user’s access to those resources. Conversely, you
cannot simply allow anyone and everyone complete access to everything. The core of access control is
the concept introduced in Chapter 1: least privileges. Each person is given the minimum privileges
necessary to do his or her job. No more and no less.
This is where the least privileges concept comes into play. The idea is simple. Each user, including IT
personnel, gets the least access they can have and still effectively do their job. Rather than ask the
question “why not give this person access to X?” you should ask “why give this person access to X?” And
if you don’t have a very good reason, then don’t. This is one of the fundamentals of computer security.
The more people that have access to any resource, the more likely some breach of security is to occur.
Along with, and related to, least privileges is the concept of implicit deny. Implicit deny means that all
users are implicitly denied access to network resources until an administrator explicitly grants them. 
Separation of duty, job rotation, and mandatory vacations are also important and related concepts.
Separation of duty means that no one person can perform critical tasks; at least two individuals are
needed. This prevents one person from accidently, or intentionally, causing some security breach via
inappropriate use of critical functions. Job rotation and mandatory vacations are both used to make
sure that, periodically, the person performing a given job changes. This makes it more difficult for one
person to exploit his or her position to breach security. 
Obviously, trade-offs must be made between access and security. Examples abound. One common
example involves sales contact information. Clearly, a company’s marketing department needs access
to this data. However, what happens if ones competitors get all of your company’s contact information?
ptg999
Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures 213
That could allow them to begin targeting your current client list. This requires a trade-off between
security and access. In this case, you would probably give salespeople access only to the contacts that
are within their territory. No one other than the sales manager should have complete access to all the
marketing data. 
Developmental Policies
Many IT departments include programmers/web developers. Unfortunately, many security policies do
not address secure programming. No matter how good your firewalls, proxy server, virus scanning, and
policies are, if your developers create code that is flawed, you will have security breaches. Clearly the
topic of secure programming requires a separate volume to explore thoroughly. Nonetheless, we can
consider a brief checklist for defining secure development policies. If your company currently has no
secure programming initiatives, this checklist is certainly better than developing in a vacuum. It can
also serve as a starting point to get you thinking, and talking, about secure programming:
■ All code, especially code done by outside parties (contractors, consultants, etc.) must be
checked for back doors/Trojan horses.
■ All buffers must have error handling which prevents buffer overruns.
■ All communication (such as using TCP sockets to send messages) must adhere to your organi-
zation’s secure communications guidelines.
■ Any code that opens any port or performs any sort of communication is thoroughly documented
and the IT security unit is apprised of the code, what it will do, and how it will be used.
■ All input is filtered for items that might facilitate an attack such as an SQL injection attack.
■ All vendors should supply you with a signed document verifying that there are no security
flaws in their code.
Following these guidelines will not guarantee that no flawed code gets introduced into your system, but
it will certainly lower the odds, significantly. And the unfortunate fact is that these simple steps alone
are more than most organizations are taking. A very good place to look at security policies is the SANS
Institute (www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/).
Standards, Guidelines, and Procedures
Related to policies are standards, guidelines, and procedures. All of these documents are related to
security policies and in fact support those policies. A standard is a general statement of the desired
level of operation. For example, requiring 99.5% network uptime would be a standard. A guideline is a
general suggestion on how to achieve some standard. Guidelines are broad and are sometimes optional
(i.e., not mandatory). Finally, we have procedures. Procedures are specific instructions on how to
handle a specific issue.
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies214
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the technology is not enough to ensure a secure network. You must have
clear and specific policies detailing procedures on your network. Those policies must cover employee
computer resource use, new employees, outgoing employees, access rights, how to respond to an emer-
gency, and even how secure code in applications and websites is.
User policies must cover all aspects of how the user is expected to use company technology. In some
cases, such as instant messaging and web use, policies may be difficult to enforce, but that does not
change the fact that they must still be in place. If your user policies fail to cover a particular area of
technology use, then you will have difficulty taking any action against any employee who performs
that particular misuse.
We also learned that it is not just the end user who will need policies. The IT staff needs clearly delin-
eated policies covering how to handle various situations. Of particular concern will be policies
dictating how to handle new users or exiting users. You also need a carefully considered change
management policy.

EXERCISES
Each of these exercises is intended to give the student experience writing limited portions of a policy.
Taken together the exercises represent a complete policy for a college campus computer network.
EXERCISE 10.1: User Policies
Using the guidelines provided in this chapter (and other resources as needed), create a document that
defines user policies. The policies should clearly define acceptable and unacceptable use for all per-
sonnel. You may require some separate policies for administration, faculty, and students.
EXERCISE 10.2: New Student Policy
Using the guidelines provided in this chapter (and other resources as needed), create a step-by-step IT
security policy for implementing a new user account for a student.
The policy should define what resources the student has access to, what she does not have access to,
and for how long access is granted.
EXERCISE 10.3: Leaving Student Policy
Using the guidelines provided in this chapter (and other resources as needed), create a step-by-step IT
security policy for handling user accounts/rights for a student who is leaving prematurely (drops, is
expelled, etc.).
ptg999
CHAPTER 10 Security Policies218
You will need to consider specialized student scenarios, such as a student who works as an assistant
to a faculty member or as a lab assistant in a computer lab and may have access to resources most stu-
dents do not.
EXERCISE 10.4: New Faculty/Staff Policy
Using the guidelines provided in this chapter (and other resources as needed), create a step-by-step IT
security policy for implementing a new user account for a faculty or staff member.
The policy should define what resources the faculty or staff member has access to, what she does not
have access to, and any restrictions. (Hint: Unlike student policies, you won’t need to define time
length since it should be indefinite.)
EXERCISE 10.5: Leaving Faculty/Staff Policy
Write a policy for how to handle a faculty departure (quit, fired, retired, etc.). Use the guidelines in
this chapter and any other resources you like to get you started.
Make certain you consider not only shutting down access but also the possibility of proprietary re-
search material existing on the faculty/staff member’s workstation.

Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Understand how to secure a system
■ Probe a system for vulnerabilities
■ Use vulnerability scanning tools
■ Evaluate potential security consultants
Introduction
At this point, it should be clear that it is necessary to assess any system periodically for vulnerabilities. The
first part of this chapter will discuss the essential steps that you should follow in assessing a system for
vulnerabilities. The purpose of this chapter is to get someone who is new to computer security to begin
thinking about these issues. This chapter is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject, nor a
substitute for getting an expert consultant. In fact, many of the topics, such as disaster recovery and
policies, have had entire volumes written on them. However, it should give you a basic blueprint you can
follow. Specific details will depend on your particular environment, budget, skills, and security needs. The
second part of this chapter will discuss various tools you can use to scan your network for vulnerabilities.
In this book, you have thus far examined a number of threats to individual computers and networks. You
have learned specific defenses against each of these dangers. However, you have not yet looked at a
comprehensive approach to security. In the second part of this chapter, you will learn many of the security
procedures that can be implemented to provide your environment with more secure computing. Note that
this chapter is about overall procedures that you need to perform in securing a system rather than specific
step-by-step techniques.

Basics of Assessing a System 221
Basics of Assessing a System
Disaster recovery, access rights, and appropriate policies are topics that are often overlooked by those
new to security. To keep it simple and easy to remember, the stages of assessing a system’s security can
be separated into the six P’s:
■ Patch
■ Ports
■ Protect
■ Policies
■ Probe
■ Physical
Patch
The first rule of computer security is to check patches. This is true for networks, home computers,
laptops, tablets, smart phones, literally any computer. This means that the operating system, database
management systems, development tools, Internet browsers, and so forth are all checked for patches. In
a Microsoft environment, this should be easy, as the Microsoft website has a utility that will scan your
system for any required patches to the browser, operating system, or Office products. It is a very basic
tenet of security to ensure that all patches are up to date. This should be one of the first tasks when
assessing a system.
It is also important to consider the types of patches. The most important are labeled important or
critical. (Microsoft labels them critical, but other vendors may use other designation.) These must be
applied, and without them your system simply is not secure. Next are recommended patches. These
should be applied unless you have some compelling reason not to. And finally, we have optional
patches. Your system will not be vulnerable without these. These optional patches usually enhance or
correct some minor functionality in the system, but are not necessary for security.
FYI: Patching and Applications
Whenever there is a patch to an operating system or application, there is also documentation
(sometimes in a Read Me file, sometimes at the download site) that indicates what the patch is
fixing. This documentation also lists any known adverse interactions with other applications.
Therefore, you should always read this documentation before you install a patch. In most cases,
the problems are minimal and often involve obscure situations. But it is always good to check first
to make sure that a service or application upon which you are dependent is not adversely
impacted.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning222
FYI: Ports on Routers
One security flaw seen in many organizations that are otherwise security conscious is a failure to
close ports on routers. This is particularly a problem for large organizations with wide area
networks (WANs) spread over multiple locations. The router between each location should be
filtered and too often is not.
Once you have ensured that all patches are up to date, the next step is to set up a system to
ensure that they are kept up to date. One simple method is to initiate a periodic patch review
where, at a scheduled time, all machines are checked for patches. There are also automated solu-
tions that will patch all systems in your organization. It is imperative that all machines be patched,
not just the servers.
The question becomes when to patch. For home users it is usually recommended that automatic
patching is turned on so that their systems get patched as soon as the patch is available.
However, this is not recommended for network administrators. It is entirely possible that a
particular patch may not be compatible with some software on your network. A good example
occurred in 2010 with McAfee AntiVirus Business Edition. In April 2010, an update to McAfee
caused computers running Windows XP Service Pack 3 to shut down. This caused a great many
problems for networks with Windows XP workstations. It is recommended that you install patches
on a test machine that has an identical configuration to your networks workstations. Then after the
patch has been tested, it can be pushed out to the network.
Ports
As you learned in Chapter 2, “Networks and the Internet,” all communication takes place via some
port. Any port you do not explicitly need should be shut down. This means that those unused services
on servers and individual workstations should be shut down. Both Windows (XP, Vista, or 7) and Linux
have built-in port-filtering capability. Windows 2000 Professional was the first Windows operating
system to include port-filtering capability. Windows XP expanded this to a fully functional firewall.
And more recently Windows 7 added a firewall that could block outgoing as well as incoming traffic.
Shutting down a service in Windows and port filtering are both discussed in more detail below.
You should also shut down any unused router ports in your network. If your network is part of a larger
WAN, then it is likely you have a router connecting you to that WAN. Every open port is a possible
avenue of entry for a malware or intruder. Therefore, every port you can close is one less opportunity
for such attacks to affect your system.
In Practice
Shutting Down a Service in Windows
For an individual machine that is not running firewall software, you do not directly close ports;
instead, you shut down the service using that port. For example, if you do not use an FTP service
ptg999
Basics of Assessing a System 223
FIGURE 11.1 Services.
The window in Figure 11.1 shows all services installed on your machine, whether they are running
or not. Notice that the window also displays information about whether a service is running,
whether it starts up automatically, and so forth. In Windows XP, more information can be seen by
selecting an individual service. When you double-click on an individual service in any version of
Windows (Windows XP, Vista, 7, Server 2003, or Server 2008), you see a dialog box similar to
Figure 11.2 that describes the details about that service. 
but you see that port is on, chances are that you unknowingly have an FTP service running on that
machine. In Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008, if you have administrative privileges, the
following three steps can be taken to shut down an unneeded service.
1. Go to the Control Panel. Double-click Administrative Tools (note in Windows 7 you first
have to click on System and Security).
2. Double-click Services. You should see a window similar to the one shown in Figure 11.1.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning224
FIGURE 11.2 Disabled services.
In the example shown in Figure 11.1, you see a fax service on a machine that does not require it.
To illustrate the procedure, this service is going to be disabled. Before you turn off any service,
however, you need to check whether other services depend on the one you are about to shut off.
If other services depend on the one you want to turn off and you proceed to turn it off, you will
cause the other services to fail.
3. Click on the Dependencies tab. In our case, the fax service has no dependencies.
4. Click the General tab.
5. Change the Startup type to Disabled.
6. Click the Stop button in the Service status section, if necessary. Your dialog box should
look similar to Figure 11.2. The fax service is now shut down.
7. Click OK to accept the edits made and close the Properties dialog box. Close the Services
dialog box and the Administrative Tools dialog box.
Shutting down unneeded ports and services is an essential and very basic part of computer security. As
mentioned above, every port open (and every service running) is a possible avenue for a hacker or virus
to get to your machine. Therefore, the rule is: If you don’t need it, shut it down and block it. 
It is best for you to first make a list of all software that you are running. Then, look up the ports and
protocols that you will need for that software and allow only those. It is important to keep in mind that
these are ports for incoming traffic. If your machine is not used as a database server, web server, or
ptg999
Basics of Assessing a System 225
other type of server and if your machine is a stand-alone one, you can (and should) close all ports.
Workstations on networks may need some ports open for network utilities. We will examine some
interesting utilities later in this chapter.
Protect
The next phase of assessing a system’s security is to ensure that all reasonable protective software and
devices are employed. This means, at a minimum, a firewall between your network and the outside
world. Firewalls were discussed in Chapter 2. You should also consider using an intrusion-detection
system (IDS) on that firewall and any web servers. Remember we discussed Snort IDS in a previous
chapter. An IDS is considered nonessential by some security experts; you can certainly have a secure
network without one. However, they are the only way to know of impending attacks, and there are free,
open source IDSs available. For that reason, I highly recommend them. The firewall and IDS will
provide basic security to your network’s perimeter, but you also need virus scanning. Each and every
machine, including servers, must have a virus scanner that is updated regularly. The point has already
been made that a virus infection is the greatest threat to most networks. As also previously discussed, it
is probably prudent to consider antispyware software on all of your systems. This will prevent users of
your network from inadvertently running spyware on the network. 
In Practice
Finding a Firewall
When selecting a firewall to use, you have a number of options. You can purchase a very inex-
pensive router-based firewall for your high-speed Internet connection. You can get a router that is
separate from your DSL or cable router. Or you can get one that includes the functions of your
cable or DSL router with the firewall. The websites listed below should be helpful to you in finding
more information on these options and determining which will best suit your needs.
■ Linksys: www.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=20&grid=5 (Note: Linksys was
purchased by Cisco, and the link should now take you to the Cisco site.)
■ Home PC Firewall Guide: www.firewallguide.com/
■ Broadband Guide: www.firewallguide.com/broadband.htm
In addition to the information on the firewall options available, you can also find many free or very
inexpensive firewall packages on the Internet. Following is a list of some of the more popular fire-
walls available via the Internet.
■ Firestarter: This is a free packet-filtering application for Linux available at 
www.fs-security.com. This software is installed a Linux machine designed to be 
used as your network firewall.
■ Norton Personal Firewall: This product is inexpensive and is available for multiple oper-
ating systems. A free trial download is available from www.symantec.com.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning226
■ McAfee Personal Firewall: This product is similar in price and basic function to Norton
Personal Firewall. You can find out more about this product at http://us.mcafee.com.
■ Outpost Firewall: This product is designed for the home or small office user. It has both a
free version and an enhanced commercial version. You can find out more about this
product at www.agnitum.com/products/outpost/.
For medium-sized or larger networks, with more flexible budgets, you might consider the options
listed below:
■ Citrix offers an application gateway specifically tailored for web servers. This solution is rela-
tively inexpensive and can be ideal for companies whose primary function is to provide
websites or web services. Information is available at www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/
subfeature.asp?contentID=2300448
■ The Firebox, from Watchguard Technologies (www.watchguard.com/products/fireboxx.asp),
is an application gateway firewall that is router based. It is relatively easy to set up and
configure and is appropriate for medium-sized networks.
And finally, for Linux users, you have a built-in firewall called IP Tables; this is the successor to the
earlier IP Chains. This is an excellent solution for any system using Linux.
Policies
While policies were discussed in detail in Chapter 10, “Security Policies,” we briefly review some
aspects of policies here. It is absolutely essential that any organization have clearly written policies on
computer security—and that those policies be strongly enforced by management. Those policies
should cover acceptable use of organizational computers, the Internet, email, and any other aspect of
the system. Policies should prohibit the installation of any software on the systems. Only IT personnel
should install software and only after they have verified its safety.
Policies should also advise users against opening unknown/unexpected attachments. Something that I
recommend is for people within an organization or department to use a codeword. If that codeword
does not appear in the body of the email (or in the subject line), then they do not open the attachment.
Most virus attacks spread via email attachments. The subject line and body of such email messages are
generated automatically by the virus itself. If all of your legitimate attachments have a codeword in the
subject line, it is highly unlikely that this word would be in the subject line of an email sent by a virus.
This alone could prevent your users from inadvertently opening a virus.
Polices should also be in place that clearly delineate who has access to what data, how backups are
performed, and what to do to recover data in the case of a disaster (commonly called a disaster
recovery plan). Data access must be limited to only those personnel with an actual need to access the
data. For example, not everyone in the human resources department needs access to disciplinary files
on all employees. Does your organization have a plan for what to do if a fire destroys your servers with
all their data? Where do you get new machines? Who gets them? Is there an offsite copy of the data
backup? All of these questions must be addressed in a disaster recovery plan.
ptg999
Basics of Assessing a System 227
There should be a policy regarding passwords: acceptable minimum length, lifetime of a password,
password history, and passwords to be avoided, such as any word that has a direct connection to the
user. For example, a user who is a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys should not use a password that has
any relation to that sports team. Also, passwords that relate to personal data, such as spouse’s birthday,
children’s names, or pet’s names, are poor choices. A password policy could also include recommenda-
tions or restrictions on a password.
FYI: Good Passwords
A good password is at least 8 (preferably 15) characters long; contains letters, numbers, and char-
acters; and combines upper- and lowercase. A good general practice is to select a word that has no
personal meaning to you, a random sequence of numbers, and then various-case letters and char-
acters to further disguise the password. For example, you might use something such as $TrEe785.
That password would be nearly impossible for anyone to guess and difficult for password-cracking
software to break. It would, however, also be difficult to remember. For this reason, many people in
the information security field are recommending the use of passphrases instead of passwords. These
create longer passwords that are even more difficult to break. An example would be: My telephone #
is 555-555-1234. This is a 30-character password containing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and
special characters. It is also much easier to remember than $TrEe785.
Additionally, a password should not be kept for long periods of time. A 90- or 180-day password
replacement schedule is good for most situations. This is referred to as password age. (This, of course,
must be weighed against the user’s access to sensitive information or data. A company financial officer
might change her password weekly; a nuclear arms engineer might change his password daily; and a
mail clerk might need to change her password on a much less frequent basis.)You can set many systems
(including Windows) to force the user to get a new password after a certain period of time. You should
also make sure the person does not merely reuse old passwords, referred to as password history and also
referred to in some operating systems as uniqueness. A good rule of thumb is a history depth of five—
meaning that the person cannot reuse any of their previous five passwords. Additionally, you may need
to implement a minimum password age to prevent users from immediately changing their password five
times to return to their current password. Generally, a minimum of one day is recommended.
FYI: How Extensive Should Policies Be?
This question frequently arises: How extensive should policies be? Should they be a few brief
pages or a lengthy manual? Various computer security experts will have differing opinions. My
opinion is that the policies should be lengthy enough to cover your organizational needs, but not
so lengthy as to be unwieldy. In short, overly long policy manuals are likely to be left unread by
employees and hence not be followed. If you absolutely must have a long policy manual, then
create a few brief submanuals for specific employee groups so as to increase the chances of the
policies being read and followed. It is probably a good idea to have new hires briefed on security
polices by someone from the IT Security department.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning228
FYI: Checklists and Policies
For your convenience and to assist in getting you started in securing your systems and estab-
lishing good policies, the SANS Institute website contains examples of checklists and policies
(www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/). Each of these is also available electronically through
the companion website for this text. 
Finally, policies should include specific instructions on what to do in case of an employee termination.
It is imperative that all of that person’s login accounts be immediately disabled and any physical access
they have to any part of the system be immediately discontinued. Unfortunately, many organizations
fail to address this properly and give an opportunity to a disgruntled former employee to inflict retri-
bution on his or her former employer.
Probe
An important step in assessing any network is to probe the network. We will look at several probes later
in this chapter. The key is to periodically probe your own network for security flaws. This should be a
regularly scheduled event—perhaps once a quarter. At a minimum, a complete audit of your security
should be completed once per year. That would, of course, include probing your ports. However, a true
security audit would also include a review of your security policies, your patching system, any security
logs you maintain, personnel files of those in secure positions, and so forth.
Physical
Lastly, you cannot ignore physical security. The most robustly secure computer that is left sitting unat-
tended in an unlocked room is not at all secure. You must have some policy or procedure governing the
locking of rooms with computers as well as the handling of laptops, PDAs, and other mobile computer
devices. Servers must be in a locked and secure room with as few people as is reasonably possible having
access to them. Backup tapes should be stored in a fireproof safe. Documents and old backup tapes
should be destroyed before disposal (e.g., by melting tapes, magnetizing hard disks, breaking CDs).
Physical access to routers and hubs should also be tightly controlled. Having the most hi-tech, profes-
sional information security on the planet but leaving your server in an unlocked room to which
everyone has access is a recipe for disaster. One of the most common mistakes in the arena of physical
security is co-locating a router or switch in a janitorial closet. This means that, in addition to your own
security personnel and network administrators, the entire cleaning staff has access to your router or
switch, and any one of them could leave the door unlocked for an extended period of time.
There are some basic rules you should follow regarding physical security:
■ Server rooms: The room where servers are kept should be the most fire-resistant room in your
building. It should have a strong door with a strong lock, such as a deadbolt. Only those person-
nel who actually have a need to go in the room should have a key. You might also consider a
ptg999
Securing Computer Systems 229
server room log wherein each person logs in when they enter or exit the room. There are actu-
ally electronic locks that record who enters a room, when they enter, and when they leave. You
may also wish to consider using biometric locks on critical areas such as server rooms. Consult
local security vendors in your area for more details on price and availability. 
■ Workstations: All workstations should have an engraved identifying mark. You should also
routinely inventory them. It is usually physically impossible to secure them as well as you
secure servers, but you can take a few steps to improve their security. Some companies choose
to attach the workstations to the desks with cables. This can be effective and affordable.
■ Miscellaneous equipment: Projectors, CD burners, laptops, and so forth should be kept under
lock and key. Any employee that wishes to use one should be required to sign it out, and it
should be checked to see that it is in proper working condition and that all parts are present
when it is returned.
Securing Computer Systems
In this section, you will examine various security specifics for an individual workstation, a server, and
a network. You should be aware, however, that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. A number of very
reputable organizations have put together step-by-step guides, or security templates, that you can use in
your network setting. These can be modified to fit your particular organization, or they can be used as
a starting point for you in forming your own security strategy.
■ The National Security Agency has a website with a number of specific network security guides:
www.nsA.gov/snac/
■ The Center for Internet Security offers a number of security guides and benchmarks:
www.cisecurity.com/
■ The SANS institute has a number of sample policies you can download and modify or use:
www.sans.org/resources/policies/
There are also templates that can be applied to many operating systems and applications (such as
Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Exchange) that will implement certain security precautions. These
templates can be found for many products and then simply installed on the appropriate machine. Some
security professionals prefer to handle the details of security themselves, but many administrators find
these templates to be useful—and they can be invaluable for the beginner.
■ Windows Security templates: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816585
■ MS Exchange templates: www.microsoft.com/exchange/default.mspx
■ A collection of Windows templates: http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Understanding-
Windows-Security-Templates.html. The use of these templates will at least give you a baseline
of security on the applications to which they are applied. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning230
Securing an Individual Workstation
There are a number of steps that any prudent individual can take to make their individual computer
secure. These steps should be taken for both home computers and workstations on a network. In the
former case, securing the individual computer is the only security option available. In the latter case,
securing the individual computers as well as the perimeter allows for a layered approach to security.
While some network administrators simply secure the perimeter via a firewall and/or proxy server, it is
generally believed that you should also secure each and every machine in your organization. This is
particularly vital in protecting against virus attacks and some of the distributed denial of service attacks
that you learned about in Chapter 4, “Denial of Service Attacks.”
FYI: Hardening a System
The process of securing a computer system against hackers, malware, and other intruders is
sometimes referred to as hardening a system. You may see the terms server hardening or router
hardening commonly used.
The first step with an individual computer is to ensure that all patches are appropriately applied.
Microsoft’s website has utilities that will scan your machine for needed patches for both Windows and
Microsoft Office. It is critical that you do this on a regular basis—once per quarter as a minimum. You
should also check your other software vendors to see whether they have some similar mechanism to
update patches for their products. It is amazing how many virus outbreaks have been widespread
despite patches being available to secure the flaws they exploited. Too many people simply do not
ensure that patches are applied regularly. For a home computer, this is the most critical step in your
security strategy and will protect you from a number of attacks designed to exploit security flaws. For
a networked workstation, this is still a vital piece of the overall security strategy and cannot be ignored.
The second step in securing an individual computer is restricting the ability to install programs or alter
the machine configuration. In a network environment, this would mean that most users do not have
permissions to install software or change any system settings. Only network administrators and desig-
nated support staff should have that ability. In a home environment, this would mean that only a
responsible party or parties (such as the parents) have access rights to install software.
One of the reasons for this particular precaution is to prevent users from accidentally installing a Trojan
horse or other malware on their machine. If a person is prevented from installing any software, then
there is no chance of inadvertently installing improper software such as a Trojan horse, adware, or
other malware. Blocking users from altering the machine’s configuration also prevents them from
changing system security settings. Novice users may hear of some way to change some setting and will
do so, not realizing the security risks they are exposing their system to.
A perfect example in which a novice might adversely alter security settings involves the Windows
Messenger service. This is not used for chat rooms or instant messaging, as many novices incorrectly
assume. It is instead used for network administrators to send a broadcast message to all people on a
ptg999
Securing Computer Systems 231
network. Unfortunately, some adware programs also use that service to circumvent pop-up blockers
and inundate you with ads. Thus, a security-conscious person might disable that service. You would not
want an inexperienced person to turn it back on by thinking it is needed for instant messaging. 
It is absolutely critical in any network environment that limits be placed on what the average user can
do to a machine’s configuration. Without such limits, even well-meaning employees could eventually
compromise security. This particular step is often met with some resistance from the organization. If
you are in charge of a system’s security, it is your job to educate the decision makers as to why this step
is so critical.
The next step has been discussed previously in this book. Each and every computer must have antivirus
and antispyware software. You must also set it to routinely automatically update its virus definitions.
Updated, running antivirus software is an integral part of any security solution. The two-pronged
approach of antispyware and antivirus software should be a major component in your individual
computer security strategy. Some analysts feel that antispyware is a nice extra, but not a critical
component. Others contend that spyware is a rapidly growing problem and will probably eventually
equal or surpass the dangers of virus attacks. 
Of course, if your operating system has a built-in firewall, it is a good idea to configure it and have it
turned on. Windows 7 and Linux both come with built-in firewall features. Turn them on and configure
them properly. The only significant problem you may encounter in implementing this step is that most
networks require a certain amount of traffic between key servers (such as the DNS server) and indi-
vidual computers. When you configure your firewall, make certain you are allowing appropriate traffic
through. If you are at home, you can simply block all incoming traffic. If you are on a network, you
must identify what traffic you need to allow.
Passwords and physical security, as discussed earlier in this chapter, are a critical part of computer
security. You must ensure that all users utilize passwords that are at least eight characters long and consist
of a combination of letters, numbers, and characters. In general, make sure that your password policy is
complete and that all employees follow it. This will ensure that your physical security system is sound.
Following these guidelines will not make your computer totally impervious to danger, but these guide-
lines will make your workstation as secure as it reasonably can be. Remember that, even in a network
environment, it is critical to also secure each individual computer as well as the perimeter. 
Securing a Server
The core of any network lies in its servers. This includes database servers, web servers, DNS servers,
file and print servers, and so on. These computers provide the resources for the rest of the network.
Generally, your most critical data will be stored on these machines. This means that these computers
are an especially attractive target for intruders and securing them is of paramount importance. 
Essentially, to secure a server, you should apply the steps you would to any workstation and then add
additional steps. There will not be a user on that machine routinely typing documents or using spread-
sheets, so extra-tight restrictions are unlikely to cause the same difficulties for end users that they
might on a workstation.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning232
To begin with, you must follow the same steps you would for a workstation. Each and every server
should have its software routinely patched. It should also have virus-scanning software and perhaps
antispyware as well. It is critical that access to these machines, both via logging on and physical
access, be limited to only those people with a clear need. There are, however, additional steps you
should take with a server that you might not take with a standard workstation.
Most operating systems for servers (e.g., Windows 2008 Server, Linux) have the ability to log a variety
of activities. These activities would include failed logon attempts, software installation, and other
activities. You should make sure that logging is turned on and that all actions that might pose any
security risk are logged. You then must make certain that those logs are checked on a periodic basis.
Remember that the data on a server is more valuable than the actual machine. For this reason, data
must be backed up on a regular basis. A daily backup is usually preferred but, in some cases, a weekly
backup might be adequate. The backup tapes should be kept in a secure offsite location (such as a bank
safety deposit box) or in a fireproof safe. It is critical that you limit access to those backup tapes just as
you would limit access to the servers themselves.
With any computer, you should shut down any service you do not need. However, with a server, you
may wish to take the extra step of uninstalling any software or operating system components you do
not need, meaning that anything not required for the server to function should be removed. But think
carefully about this before proceeding. Clearly, games and office suites are not needed for a server.
However, a browser might be necessary to update patches.
There is another step that should be taken with servers that is not necessary with workstations. Most
server operating systems have built-in accounts. For example, Windows has built-in administrator, guest,
and power user accounts. Any hacker who wants to try and guess passwords will begin by trying to guess
the passwords that go with these standard users. In fact, there are utilities on the Web that will do this
automatically for the would-be intruder. First, you should create your own accounts with names that do
not reflect their level of permission. For example, disable the administrator account and create an account
called basic_user. Set up basic_user as the administrator account, with appropriate permissions. (Of
course, only give that username and password to those people you want to have administrator privileges.)
If you do this, a hacker would not immediately guess that this account is the one that they want to crack.
Remember, hackers ultimately want administrative privileges on a target system; concealing which
accounts have those privileges is a vital step in preventing the hacker from breaching your security.
FYI: Handling Old Backup Media
Unfortunately, many network administrators simply throw old backup media in the trash. Persons
with malicious intent who retrieve this discarded media could restore it to their own machine. This
could give them access to your older data without breaking in to your system or could give them
very valuable clues as to your current security practices, depending on what is found on that
media. Old media (e.g., tapes, CDs, hard disks) should be thoroughly destroyed. For a CD, this
means physically breaking it. For a tape, this means partially or completely melting it. Hard disks
should be magnetized with a powerful magnet.
ptg999
Securing Computer Systems 233
There are a variety of Registry settings in any version of Windows that can be altered to increase your
security. If you use a scanning tool, such as Cerberus, it returns a report stating the weaknesses in your
Registry settings. What items in the Registry settings might cause a security problem? A few items that
are commonly examined include the following:
■ Logon: If your Registry is set so that the logon screen shows the last user’s name, you have
done half of the hacker’s work for her. Since she now has a username, she only needs to guess
the password.
■ Default Shares: Certain drives/folders are shared by default. Leaving them shared like this
presents a security hazard.
These are just a few of the potential problems in the Windows Registry. A tool such as Cerberus will
not only tell you what the problems are, but will make recommendations for corrections. To edit your
Registry, go to Start, select Run, and then key regedit. This will start the Registry editor. 
Securing a Network
Obviously, the first step in securing a network is to secure all computers that take part in that network,
including all workstations and servers. However, this is just one part of network security. By now it
should be clear that using a firewall and proxy server are also critical elements in network security.
Chapter 12, “Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare,” will provide more details on these devices.
For now, it is important to realize that you need to have them. Most experts also recommend using an
IDS. There are a number of such systems available—some are even free. These systems can detect
things, such as port scanning, which might indicate that a person is preparing to attempt a breach of
your security perimeter.
If your network is at all large, then you might consider partitioning it into smaller segments with a
firewall-enabled router between segments. Of course, “large” is a vague term and you will have to
decide if your network is large enough to require partitioning. In this way, if one segment is compro-
mised, the entire network will not be compromised. In this system, you might consider putting your
most important servers (database, file) on a secure segment.
Since web servers must be exposed to the outside world and are the most common point of attack, it
then makes sense to separate them from the rest of the network. Many network administrators will put
a second firewall between the web server and the rest of the network. This means that if a hacker
exploits a flaw in your web server and gains access to it, then he will not have access to your entire
network. This brings up the issue of what should be on your web server. The answer is: only what you
need to post web pages. No data, documents, or other information should be stored on that server, and
certainly no extraneous software. The operating system and web server software are all that are
required. You may add a few other items (such as an IDS) if your situation requires it. Any other
software running on that server is a potential security risk.
Another concept you should consider is the DMZ. A DMZ is a demilitarized zone. It essentially
involves setting up two firewalls, an outer and an inner firewall. Resources that must be accessible to
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning234
the outside world are between the two firewalls. The outer firewall is more permissive, and the inner
firewall is highly restrictive. There are even routers that include this functionality in a single box. By
plugging into certain ports, you are adding a device either behind the inner firewall, or in the DMZ.
This is shown in Figure 11.3.
 The Internet
Outer Firewall
Inner FirewallOrganization Network
DMZ
Web Server
FIGURE 11.3 DMZ.
You must also have policies that guide users in how to use the system, as we discussed earlier in this
chapter. The most robust security in the world will not be of much use if a careless user inadvertently
compromises your security. Keep in mind that you must have policies in place that guide users in what
is considered appropriate use of the system and what is not.
Just as you take steps to harden your servers (e.g., patching the operating system, shutting down
unneeded services), you should also harden your router. The specifics of what needs to be done will be
contingent on your particular router manufacturer and model, but a few general rules should be
followed:
ptg999
Scanning Your Network 235
■ Use good passwords: All routers are configurable. They can be programmed. Therefore, you
must obey the same password policies on a router that you would use on any server including
minimum password length and complexity, age of password, and password history. If your
router allows you to encrypt the password (as Cisco and other vendors do), then do it.
■ Use logging: Most routers allow for logging. You should turn this on and monitor it just as you
would monitor server logs.
■ Security rules: Some basic router security rules should also be followed:
■ Do not answer to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests for hosts that are not on
the user local area network (LAN).
■ If no applications on your network use a given port, that port should be also shut down on
the router.
■ Packets not originating from inside your LAN should not be forwarded.
These rules are simply a beginning. You will need to consult your vendor’s documentation for addi-
tional recommendations. You must absolutely pay as much attention to securing your router as you do
to securing your servers. The following links might be helpful:
■ Router security: www.mavetju.org/networking/security.php
■ Cisco router hardening: www.sans.org/rr/whitepapers/firewalls/794.php
Scanning Your Network
The only way to be sure your network is secure is to actually check for vulnerabilities and flaws. In this
section, we will look at some commonly used vulnerability scanners. These tools can be an invaluable
asset for any network administrator.
MBSA
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer is a free tool from Microsoft (just do a web search on the name
to get the latest version). It is also very simple to use. Critics point out that it is not as robust as other
tools, and that is an accurate assessment. However, it is easy to use, free, and ideal for a Windows
administrator who may not be well versed in security.
MBSA (version 2.2 as of this writing) will check one or more Windows machines to see if they have
the latest patches, have good password policies, and generally if they have basic security in place.
Once you run the program, you first choose whether you want to scan a single computer or multiple
computers, as shown in Figure 11.4.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning236
FIGURE 11.4 Starting MBSA.
For demonstration purposes, we will scan a single computer. When you choose that option, you will
see a screen that allows you to designate the computer to scan (it defaults to the computer you are on)
and what scans to perform. This is shown in Figure 11.5.
ptg999
Scanning Your Network 237
FIGURE 11.5 Scanning a single computer.
Then you simply start the scan. For a single computer, it won’t take long, but for multiple computers it
could take quite some time. When it is done, you will receive a report that details everything checked,
if it was okay or not, and it has links for deeper explanations if you need them. This is shown in 
Figure 11.6.
While I agree with critics that there are more robust scanning tools, I personally feel this particular tool
is an excellent choice for someone who is a security novice. It is easy to use and will give you
actionable information quickly.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning238
FIGURE 11.6 MBSA report.
NESSUS
Nessus (www.Nessus.org) is the premiere network vulnerability scanner. There is a free version for
personal use and a commercial version. This is perhaps the most widely used vulnerability scanner
available today. It is not nearly as simple to use as MBSA but has many more capabilities. We will
explore the basic functionality. If you have an interest in learning more about Nessus, then it is recom-
mended that you consult the documentation available at their website.
Once you install Nessus, you will have two icons on your desktop. One is the Nessus server the other
is the client. We will launch the server first, shown in Figure 11.7. The first thing you have to do is
register it. The process is quick, easy, and free.

You can leave the default settings for now. But you need to click on the Manage Users button and add
a user. For demonstration purposes, it does not matter what name and password you give them. When
you have done that, you will close out of the server and launch the client, shown in Figure 11.9.
FIGURE 11.9 Nessus client login screen.
The Nessus client is actually a web interface. Once you log in, you will see a page with a toolbar at the
top like the one shown in Figure 11.10.
FIGURE 11.10 Nessus client main screen.
It is important that you do things in a specific order. You first have to create a policy, then you can
create a scan, and when the scan is done you will have a report. So we will start by creating a simple
policy. When you click on Policy, you will see a screen like the one shown in Figure 11.11.

Scanning Your Network 241
FIGURE 11.11 Policies.
As you can see, there are some default policies already there. But we will make our own simple policy
just so you can see how it is done. If you click on the Add button, you will see a screen like the one
shown in Figure 11.12.
FIGURE 11.12 Add a new policy.
Give your new policy some meaningful name. For demonstration purposes, something like test policy
might be appropriate. We will leave default settings on this screen, but take the time to review all the
various items on this screen.
We are going to skip credentials for now. That is only necessary if, as part of the scan, you need Nessus
to be able to log on to various systems. We are going to go to the plug-ins screen, shown in Figure 11.13.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning242
FIGURE 11.13 Selecting plug-ins.
The plug-ins are the real strength of Nessus. There are literally thousands of plug-ins for almost every
conceivable type of vulnerability. When creating your own policies, they should be for specific types of
scans. What you are scanning will determine the plug-in you select.
We are going to leave the default selection, but you should take time to review the options available to
you. Nessus provides a truly impressive array of vulnerabilities it can scan for. For now, click the Next
button, which will take you to Preferences, then click Submit. You have just created a policy. Now click
on the Scan option on the toolbar at the top. You will see a screen like the one depicted in Figure 11.14.
FIGURE 11.14 The Scan screen.
ptg999
Getting Professional Help 243
Now click the Add button and you will see a screen like the one shown in Figure 11.15.
FIGURE 11.15 Add a new scan.
Give your scan a meaningful name, then select the policy to use for this scan, enter the IP addresses to
scan in the targets text field (you can either enter a computer name or an IP address) and start your scan.
When it is done, you will be notified and you can go to the Reports screen, shown in Figure 11.16.
FIGURE 11.16 Reports.
The best thing about the Nessus reports is that you can click on any item and drill down for details. You can
also export the report to several formats. Now in this section we have just given you a basic introduction to
Nessus. It is strongly recommended that you take the time to become more familiar with Nessus.
Getting Professional Help
You may decide that you need outside help to set up and test your system’s security. This option is one
that most security professionals would highly recommend if at all possible, particularly if you are new
to security. It can be extremely helpful to get a professional consultant to assist you in setting up your
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning244
initial security strategy and policies and perhaps do a periodic audit of your security. As mentioned in
Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Security,” there are a number of people who claim to be hackers
who are not. Frankly, there are also a number of self-proclaimed security experts who simply do not
have the requisite skills. The question here is: How do you determine whether an individual is qual-
ified? Following are some guidelines to consider in making this decision.
Experience is the most important factor when looking for a security professional. You want someone
with a minimum of five years of IT experience, with two years related to security. Often, this will be a
network administrator or programmer who has moved into security. Note that this is a minimum level
of experience. More experience is always better. It is certainly possible that someone with less expe-
rience might have the requisite skill, but it is unlikely. Everyone needs a place to start, but you do not
want your systems to be the place where someone is learning. 
The quality of the person’s experience is as important as the length of experience. Ask details about the
person’s experience. For example, exactly what role did she play in computer security? Did she simply
set up policies, or did she actually do hands-on security work? What was the result? Was her system
free from virus infections and hacker breaches or not? Can you contact her references? In short, simply
because a person states that she was responsible for information security on her resume is not enough.
You need to find out exactly what she did and what the results were.
Another important aspect of a security professional is education. Remember that computer security is
a very broad subject. One needs an understanding of networks, protocols, programming, and more. It
is entirely possible for a person with no formal education to have these skills, but it is less likely than if
they had a formal education. Generally, these skills will most likely be found in a person with expe-
rience and a degree in a computer- or math-related field. That may sound somewhat intellectually
snobbish, but it is a fact. There are many people in IT who are self-taught, such as people with history
degrees that are network administrators or psychology majors that are now programmers. However, the
more areas a person focuses in, the harder it is to obtain mastery. This is not to say that a person cannot
be a security professional without a computer science, math, or engineering degree. The point is simply
that this is one factor you should consider. If someone has an unrelated degree but meets or exceeds all
other qualifications, you might still consider them. Some colleges are beginning to offer security-
specific curriculum, and a few even offer security degrees. Clearly, specific training in computer
security would be the most preferable security background.
Certifications have become very controversial in the IT profession. Some people swear by them. You
can easily find many job advertisements that demand certain certifications, such as the CNE (Certified
Novel Engineer) or MCITP (Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional). Cisco certifi-
cations are also common (Cisco Certified Network Associate through Cisco Certified Internetworking
Engineer). On the other hand, you would have no problem finding some IT professionals who deni-
grate certifications and consider them utterly worthless. A more reasonable position is somewhat
between the two extremes. A certification can be a good indicator of a candidate’s knowledge of a
specific product. For example, if you want someone to secure your Microsoft network, looking at
people who are Microsoft certified is not a bad idea. You should balance that, however, by keeping in
mind that it is entirely possible for someone with a good memory to use the various study guides
ptg999
Getting Professional Help 245
available on the Internet and pass a test they don’t actually understand. That is where experience comes
in. A certification coupled with appropriate experience is a good indicator of skill.
In addition to the certifications for network administrators, there are a number of security-related certi-
fications. Some have more credibility than others. The Security+ exam from CompTIA and the CIW
Security Analyst are both conceptual exams. This means that they test a candidate’s knowledge of
security concepts and not their ability to actually implement any security solution. This means that, by
themselves, they may not indicate the skill level you need. But if, for example, you are securing a
network using Novell, a candidate who is a CNE and has CIW Security Analyst or Security+ might be
a good person to consider.
The most respected security certification is the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Profes-
sional). This test is a grueling six-hour exam and can only be taken if you first verify four years of
security-related experience (if you also have a degree) or five years of experience (if you do not have a
degree). CISSP holders are also required to submit a recommendation from another CISSP or an
officer of their company and to take continuing education credits to maintain the certification. This is
probably the most respected security-related certification. 
The Certified Ethical Hacker certification is relatively new, and is sponsored by the EC-Council
(www.eccouncil.org/). It is an interesting test in that it actually tests basic hacking skills. It has also
been the subject of some controversy. One must keep in mind that it tests basic hacking skills, not a
mastery of hacking. But if you keep that in mind, it is an excellent certification for any penetration
tester or security administrator to have.
GIAC (www.giac.org/) has a number of security-related certifications. These all have a very solid repu-
tation in the security industry. They are, however, more expensive than other tests, and for that reason
there are fewer security professionals that have them.
All certifications get some critics. The fact is that some people do attend boot camps and cram just
enough information in to pass a certification. However the same can be said of any qualification. It is
certainly the case that there are medical doctors who are incompetent, but I am certain that if you are
sick or injured you seek out a medical doctor. The reason is that you are more likely to get qualified
help than simply selecting some random person. The same is true of certifications. I think you should
keep in mind that certifications reflect a minimum skill level, not mastery. I would recommend any
security professional have a minimum of CISSP, CEH, and one “elective” (Security+, Microsoft certi-
fication, Cisco Certification, etc.). You may wish to consult the following two articles for at least one
view of the relative merits of various certifications:
■ www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1652336
■ www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1663684
With all of that being said, you should never hire a person based solely on certifications. Those certifi-
cations should simply be one element that you consider.
ptg999
CHAPTER 11 Network Scanning and Vulnerability Scanning246
Finally, you should consider personal background. A security consultant or full-time employee will, by
definition, have access to confidential information. Any legitimate security professional will not mind
giving you
■ References
■ Permission to check their credit history
■ Permission to check their criminal background
Anyone who seems reluctant to provide any of these items should be avoided. Therefore, an ideal
security consultant might be a person with five or more years of experience, a degree in a computer-
related discipline, a certification in your organization’s operating systems as well as one of the major
security certifications, and a completely clean background, with references. As a rule, you simply
cannot be too careful in hiring a security consultant.
Unless you have a highly trained security expert on staff, you should consider bringing in a security
consultant to assess your system at least once. In our current legal environment, liability for security
breaches is still being hotly debated. Companies are being sued for failing to practice due diligence in
computer security. It is simply a wise move, both from a computer industry perspective as well as from
a legal perspective, to do everything reasonable to ensure the security of your systems.

Summary
This chapter has outlined some basic items to look for in any security assessment. You should periodi-
cally assess your network/system for security vulnerabilities. A general recommendation would be a
quarterly assessment for noncritical/low-security sites and perhaps as frequently as a weekly assessment
for high-security sites. In any case, what are outlined in this chapter are the basics of assessing the
security of a network, and they should give you a start toward securing your own network.
Safe computing is a matter of securing your computer, your network, and your servers and using
common sense on the Web. It is important to rigorously apply security practices and standards to all
computers, whether they are home computers or part of an organizational network.

rity policies in the preceding exercises, it is now time to devise your own audit plan. This plan should
detail all the steps in an audit.
ptg999
Test Your Skills 253
Note: The second part of this project is contingent upon getting permission from some organization to
allow you to audit their security. It is also ideal for a group project.
Taking the audit plan you wrote, audit a network. This audit can be conducted for any sort of organi-
zation, but you should make your first audit one with a small network (fewer than 100 users).
PROJECT 11.2: Forming a Disaster Recovery Plan
Using the knowledge you have gained thus far, create an IT disaster recovery plan for an organiza-
tion. You may use a fictitious organization, but a real organization would be better. 
PROJECT 11.3: Writing a Security Policy Document
Note: This project is designed as a group project.
It is now time to bring all you have learned thus far together. Write a complete set of security policies
for an organization. Again, you may use a fictitious company, but real organizations are better. This
set of policies must cover user access, password policies, frequency of audits (both internal and exter-
nal), minimum security requirements, guidelines for web surfing, and so on.
PROJECT 11.4: Secure Web Servers
Using the information in this chapter as well as other resources, come up with a strategy specifically
for securing a web server. This strategy should include the security of the server itself as well as
securing the network from the server.
PROJECT 11.5: Adding Your Own Guidelines
Note: This project is ideal for a group project. 
This chapter has outlined some general procedures for security. Write an essay detailing your own ad-
ditional guidelines. These can be guidelines for individual computers, servers, networks, or any com-
bination thereof. 
Case Study
Juan Garcia is the network administrator for a small company that also maintains its own web
server. He has taken the following precautions:
■ All computers are patched, have antivirus software, and have unneeded services shut down.
■ The network has a firewall with proxy server and IDS.
■ The organization has a policy requiring passwords of ten characters in length, and they
must be changed every 90 days.
Has Juan done enough to secure the network? What other actions would you recommend he take?

Cyber Terrorism and Information
Warfare
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Explain what cyber terrorism is and how it has been used in some actual cases
■ Understand the basics of information warfare
■ Have a working knowledge of some plausible cyber terrorism scenarios
■ Have an appreciation for the dangers posed by cyber terrorism
Introduction
Throughout this book, various ways have been examined in which a person might use a computer to
commit a crime. This book has also looked into specific methods to make a system more secure. One
issue that has not been addressed is that of cyber terrorism. People in countries around the world have
grown accustomed to the ever-present threat of a terrorist attack, which could come in the form of a
bomb, a hijacking, releasing a biological agent, or other means. Most people have not given much
thought to the possibility of cyber terrorism.
The first question might be this: What is cyber terrorism? According to the FBI, cyber terrorism is the
premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and
data that results in violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents
(Dick, 2002). Cyber terrorism is simply the use of computers and the Internet connectivity between them
in order to launch a terrorist attack. In short, cyber terrorism is just like other forms of terrorism—it is only
the milieu of the attack that has changed. Clearly the loss of life due to a cyber attack would be much less
than that of a bombing. In fact, it is highly likely that there would be no loss of life at all. However, signif-
icant economic damage, disruptions in communications, disruptions in supply lines, and general degra-
dation of the national infrastructure are all quite possible via the Internet. 
Chapter 12

ptg999
Actual Cases of Cyber Terrorism 255
The real question might be what is the difference between cyber espionage and cyber terrorism. First
and foremost, the goal of espionage is simply to gather information. It is preferable to the spy if no one
is even aware that anything occurred. This is true for both corporate and international espionage. Cyber
terrorism, on the other hand, seeks to cause damage, and it needs to be as public as possible. The idea
is to strike fear into people. While some might find the topics related, they are actually quite different.
It is a strong possibility that, in time, someone or some group will try to use computer methods to
launch a military or terrorist attack against our nation. Some experts make the case that the MyDoom
virus (discussed in Chapter 4, “Denial of Service Attacks”) was an example of domestic economic
terrorism. However, an attack such as that may be only the tip of the iceberg. Sometime in the near
future, our nation may be the target of a serious cyber terrorism attack. This chapter will examine some
possible cyber terrorism scenarios, with the purpose of giving you a realistic assessment of just how
serious a threat this is. In the exercises at the end of the chapter, you will have the opportunity to
examine current acts of cyber terrorism, as well as potential threats, and the actions you can take to
help prevent them.
The first edition of this book discussed cyber terrorism, as well. That was in 2004. At that time, some
may have thought that the coverage of that topic was almost fiction. That there was no real threat from
cyber terrorism. That has proven to not be the case. One of the first indications that cyber terrorism is a
real threat was that in November 2006 the Secretary of the Air Force announced the creation of the Air
Force Cyber Command. This Command’s primary function is to monitor and defend American interest
in cyberspace. The AFCC draws upon the personnel resources of the 67th Network Warfare Wing as
well as other resources. It seems that  the United States Air Force takes the threat of cyber terrorism and
cyber warfare seriously and has created an entire command to counter that threat.
Actual Cases of Cyber Terrorism
Because some readers may wonder whether this is just fear mongering, let’s look at some actual cases
of cyber terrorism before we delve into the various aspects of it. How likely is a genuine cyber terrorist
attack? Well let’s look at some real-world cases. Later in this chapter, we will examine some older,
historical cases, to get a sense of perspective. However, in this section, we will only look at recent
attacks.
In May 2007, government offices of Estonia were subjected to a mass denial of service attack. This
attack was executed because some people opposed the government’s removal of a Russian WWII
memorial. While this is a relatively minor attack, it was politically motivated and thus qualifies as
cyber terrorism.
The year 2009 brought a number of Internet-based attacks, specifically against U.S. government
websites, such as the websites of the Pentagon and the White House (in the United States) and various
government agencies in South Korea. These attacks coincided with increased tensions with North
Korea. Clearly, these where examples of cyber terrorism, albeit relatively minor.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare256
In December 2009, a far more disturbing story came out. Hackers broke into computer systems and
stole secret defense plans of the United States and South Korea. Authorities speculated that North
Korea was responsible. The information stolen included a summary of plans for military operations by
South Korean and U.S. troops in case of war with North Korea, and the attacks traced back to a
Chinese IP address. This case is clearly an example of cyber espionage and a very serious one at that.
China Eagle Union
No discussion of cyber terrorism would be complete without a discussion of the China Eagle Union.
This group consists of several thousand Chinese hackers whose stated goal is to infiltrate western
computer systems. There are a number of web resources regarding this group:
■ www.thedarkvisitor.com/2007/10/china-eagle-union/
■ https://news.hitb.org/node/6164
■ http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/27/chinA.hackers/index.html 
Members and leaders of the group insist that not only does the Chinese government have no
involvement in their activities, but that they are breaking Chinese law and are in constant danger of
arrest and imprisonment. Many analysts find this claim dubious. Whether the Chinese government is
involved in these attacks or not, some experts consider a state of cyber warfare to currently exist
between China and the United States.
Economic Attacks
There are a variety of ways that a cyber attack can cause economic damage. Lost files and lost records
are one way. Chapter 9, “Computer Security Software,” discussed cyber espionage and mentioned the
inherent value of data. In addition to stealing that data, it could simply be destroyed, in which case the
data is gone and the resources used to accumulate and analyze the data are wasted. To use an analogy,
consider that a malicious person could choose to simply destroy your car rather than steal it. In either
case, you are without the car and will have to spend additional resources acquiring transportation.
In addition to simply destroying economically valuable data (remember that there is very little data that
does not have some intrinsic value), there are other ways to cause economic disruption. Some of those
ways include stealing credit cards, transferring money from accounts, and fraud. But it is a fact that
anytime IT staff is involved with cleaning up a virus rather than developing applications or adminis-
tering networks and databases, there is economic loss. The mere fact that companies now need to
purchase antivirus software and intrusion-detection software and hire computer security professionals
means that computer crime has already caused economic damage to companies and governments
around the world. However, the general damage caused by random virus outbreaks, lone hacking
attacks, and online fraud is not the type of economic damage that is the focus of this chapter. This
chapter is concerned with a concerted and deliberate attack against a particular target or targets for the
exclusive purpose of causing direct damage.
ptg999
Economic Attacks 257
A good way to get a firm grasp on the impact of this type of attack is to walk through a scenario. Group
X (which could be an aggressive nation, terrorist group, activist group, or literally any group with the
motivation to damage a particular nation) decides to make a concerted attack on our country. They find
a small group of individuals (in this case, six) who are well versed in computer security, networking,
and programming. These individuals, motivated either by ideology or monetary needs, are organized to
create a coordinated attack. There are many possible scenarios under which they could execute such an
attack and cause significant economic harm. The example outlined below is just one of those possible
attack modalities. In this case, each individual has an assignment, and all assignments are designed to
be activated on the same specific date:
■ Team member one sets up several fake e-commerce sites. Each of these sites is only up for 72
hours and pretends to be a major stock brokerage site. During the brief time they are up, the
site’s real purpose is only to collect credit card numbers/bank account numbers and so forth. On
the predetermined date, all of those credit card and bank numbers will be automatically, anony-
mously, and simultaneously posted to various bulletin boards/websites and newsgroups, making
them available for any unscrupulous individual who wishes to use them.
■ Team member two creates a virus. This virus is contained in a Trojan horse. Its function is to
delete key system files on the predetermined date. In the meantime, it shows a series of business
tips or motivational slogans, making it a popular download with people in business.
■ Team member three creates another virus. It is designed to create distributed denial of service
attacks on key economic sites, such as those for stock exchanges or brokerage houses. The virus
spreads harmlessly and is set to begin its distributed denial of service attack on the predeter-
mined date.
■ Team members four and five begin the process of footprinting major banking systems,
preparing to crack them on the predetermined date. Footprinting is the process of gathering
information. Some from public sources, others by scanning the target system/network.
■ Team member six prepares a series of false stock tips to flood the Internet on the predetermined
date.
If each of these individuals is successful in his or her mission, on the predetermined date several major
brokerages and perhaps government economic sites are taken down, viruses flood networks, and files
are deleted from the machines of thousands of businesspeople, economists, stockbrokers. Thousands of
credit cards and bank numbers are released on the Internet, guaranteeing that many will be misused. It
is also highly likely that the cracking team members four and five will have some success—meaning
that possibly one or more banking systems are compromised. It does not take an economist to realize
that this would easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps even billions of dollars. A concerted
attack of this nature could easily cause more economic damage to our country than most traditional
terrorists attacks (i.e., bombings) have ever done.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare258
FIGURE 12.1 A team member of Group X? 
You could extrapolate on this scenario and imagine not just one group of six cyber terrorists, but five
groups of six—each group with a different mission and each mission designed to be committed
approximately two weeks apart. In this scenario, the nation’s economy would literally be under siege
for two and one-half months.
This scenario is not particularly far-fetched when you consider that, in past decades, nuclear scientists
were sought after by various nations and terrorist groups. More recently, experts in biological weapons
have been sought by these same groups. It seems extremely likely that these groups will see the possi-
bilities of this form of terrorism and seek out computer security/hacking experts. Given that there are
literally thousands of people with the requisite skills, it seems likely that a motivated organization
could find a few dozen people willing to commit these acts.
Military Operations Attacks
When computer security and national defense are mentioned together, the obvious thought that comes
to mind is the possibility of some hacker breaking into ultra-secure systems at the Department of
Defense, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), or National Security Agency (NSA). However, such an
intrusion into one of the most secure systems in the world is very unlikely—not impossible, but very
unlikely. The most likely outcome of such an attack would be that the attacker is promptly captured.
Such systems are hyper-secure, and intruding upon them is not as easy as some movies might suggest.
However, there are a number of scenarios in which breaking into less-secure systems could jeopardize
our national defense or put military plans at risk.
ptg999
General Attacks 259
Consider less-sensitive military systems for a moment, for example, systems that are responsible for
basic logistical operations (e.g., food, mail, fuel). If someone cracks one or more of these systems, he
could perhaps obtain information that several C-141s (an aircraft often used for troop transports and
parachute operations) are being routed to a base that is within flight distance of some city—a city that
has been the focal point of political tensions. This same cracker (or team of crackers) also finds that a
large amount of ammunition and food supplies, enough for perhaps 5,000 troops for two weeks, is
simultaneously being routed to that base. Then, on yet another low-security system, the cracker (or
team of crackers) notes that a given unit, such as two brigades of the 82nd Airborne Division, has had
all military leaves canceled. It does not take a military genius to conclude that these two brigades are
preparing to drop in on the target city and secure that target. Therefore, the fact that a deployment is
going to occur, the size of the deployment, and the approximate time of that deployment have all been
deduced without ever attempting to break into a high-security system.
Taking the previous scenario to the next level, assume the hacker gets deep into the low-security logis-
tical systems. Then assume that he does nothing to change the routing of the members of the brigades
or the transport planes—actions that might draw attention. However, he does alter the records for the
shipment of supplies so that the supplies are delivered two days late and to the wrong base. So there
would be two brigades potentially in harm’s way, without a resupply of ammunition or food en route.
Of course, the situation could be rectified, but the units in question may go for some time without
resupply—enough time, perhaps, to prevent them from successfully completing their mission.
These are just two scenarios in which compromising low-security/low-priority systems can lead to
very significant military problems. This further illustrates the serious need for high security on all
systems. Given the interconnectivity of so many components of both business and military computer
systems, there are no truly “low-priority” security systems.
General Attacks
The previously outlined scenarios involve specific targets with specific strategies. However, once a
specific target is attacked, defenses can be readied for it. There are many security professionals who
work constantly to thwart these specific attacks. What may be more threatening is a general and unfo-
cused attack with no specific target. Consider the various virus attacks of late 2003 and early 2004.
With the exception of MyDoom, which was clearly aimed at the Santa Cruz Organization, these attacks
were not aimed at a specific target. However, the shear volume of virus attacks and network traffic did
cause significant economic damage. IT personnel across the globe dropped their normal projects to
clean infected systems and shore up the defenses of systems.
This leads to another possible scenario in which various cyber terrorists continuously release new and
varied viruses, perform denial of system attacks, and work to make the Internet in general, and e-
commerce in particular, virtually unusable for a period of time. Such a scenario would actually be more
difficult to combat, as there would not be a specific target to defend or a clear ideological motive to use
as a clue to the identity of the perpetrators.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare260
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisitions 
These are industrial systems used to operate and monitor large-scale equipment (for example, power
generators, civil defense alarms, water treatment plants). These systems are very attractive targets for
cyber terrorism. In 2009, 60 Minutes did a report on the vulnerability of power systems. They showed
that penetration testers working for the Department of Energy were able to take over a power generator
and potentially overload it, causing permanent damage and taking it offline. The famous Stuxnet virus
that infected Iranian nuclear facilities was exploiting a vulnerability in SCADA systems. 
These systems are of particular concern because damage to them is not simply an economic attack. It
is entirely possible for lives to be lost as a result of cyber attacks on SCADA systems. 
Information Warfare
Information warfare certainly predates the advent of the modern computer and, in fact, may be as old as
conventional warfare. In essence, information warfare is any attempt to manipulate information in pursuit
of a military or political goal. When you attempt to use any process to gather information on an opponent
or when you use propaganda to influence opinions in a conflict, these are both examples of information
warfare. Chapter 7, “Industrial Espionage in Cyberspace,” discussed the role of the computer in corporate
espionage. The same techniques can be applied to a military conflict in which the computer can be used
as a tool in espionage. Although information gathering will not be reexamined in this chapter, information
gathering is only one part of information warfare. Propaganda is another aspect of information warfare.
The flow of information impacts troop morale, citizens’ outlooks on a conflict, the political support for a
conflict, and the involvement of peripheral nations and international organizations.
Propaganda
Computers and the Internet are very effective tools that can be used in the dissemination of propa-
ganda. Many people now use the Internet as a secondary news source, and some even use it as their
primary news source. This means that a government, terrorist group, political party, or any activist
group could use what appears to be an Internet news website as a front to put their own political spin
on any conflict. Such a website does not need to be directly connected to the political organization
whose views are being disseminated; in fact, it is better if it is not directly connected. The Irish Repub-
lican Army (IRA), for example, has always operated with two distinct and separate divisions: one that
takes paramilitary/terrorist action and another that is purely political. This allows the political/infor-
mation wing, called Sinn Fein, to operate independently of any military or terrorist activities. In fact,
Sinn Fein now has their own website, shown in Figure 12.2, where they disseminate news with their
own perspective (www.sinnfein.org). In this situation, however, it is fairly clear to whoever is reading
the information that it is biased toward the perspective of the party sponsoring the site. A better
scenario (for the party concerned) occurs when there is an Internet news source that is favorably
disposed to a political group’s position without having any actual connection at all. This makes it easier
for the group to spread information without being accused of any obvious bias. The political group (be
it a nation, rebel group, or terrorist organization) can then “leak” stories to this news agency.
ptg999
Information Warfare 261
FIGURE 12.2 The Sinn Fein website.
Information Control
Since World War II, control of information has been an important part of political and military
conflicts. Below are just a few examples:
■ Throughout the Cold War, Western democracies invested time and money for radio broadcasts into
communist nations. This well-known campaign was referred to as Radio Free Europe. The goal
was to create dissatisfaction among citizens of those nations, hopefully encouraging defection, dis-
sent, and general discontent. Most historians and political analysts agree that this was a success.
■ The Vietnam War was the first modern war in which there was strong and widespread domestic
opposition. Many analysts believe that opposition was due to the graphic images being brought
home via television.
■ Today, the government and military of every nation are aware of how the phrases they use to
describe activities can affect public perception. They do not say that innocent civilians were
killed in a bombing raid. Rather, they state that there was “some collateral damage.” Govern-
ments do not speak of being the aggressor or starting a conflict. They speak of “preemptive ac-
tion.” Dissenters in any nation are almost always painted as treasonous or cowards.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare262
Public perception is a very important part of any conflict. Each nation wants their own citizens to be
totally in support of what they do and to maintain a very high morale. High morale and strong support
lead to volunteers for military service, public support for funding the conflict, and political success for
the nation’s leader. At the same time, you want the enemy to have low morale—to doubt not only their
ability to be successful in the conflict but also their moral position relative to the conflict. You want
them to doubt their leadership and to be as opposed to the conflict as possible. The Internet provides a
very inexpensive vehicle for swaying public opinion.
Web pages are just one facet of disseminating information. Having people post to various discussion
groups can also be effective. One full-time propaganda agent could easily manage 25 or more distinct
online personalities, each spending time in different bulletin boards and discussion groups, espousing
the views that his political entity wants to espouse. These can reinforce what certain Internet news
outlets are posting or they could undermine those postings. They can also start rumors. Rumors can be
very effective even when probably false. People often recall hearing something with only a vague
recollection of where they heard it and whether it was supported by any data.
Such an agent could have one personality that purports to be a military member (it would take very
little research to make this credible) and could post information “not seen in newscasts” that would cast
the conflict in either a positive or negative light. She could then have other online personas that entered
the discussion who would agree with and support the original position. This would give the initial
rumor more credibility. Some people suspect this is already occurring in Usenet newsgroups and
Yahoo! discussion boards. Obviously, Usenet and Yahoo! are just two examples. The Internet is replete
with various blogs, community sites, boards, etc.
FYI: Cyber Information Warfare Now
Anyone familiar with Yahoo! news boards (this is just one example, there are certainly many more)
has probably noticed an odd phenomenon. At certain times, there will be a flood of posts from
anonymous users, all saying essentially the exact same things—even using the exact same
grammar, punctuation, and phrasing—and all in support of some ideological perspective. These
flurries often happen in times when influence of public opinion is important, such as when an
election is nearing. Whether or not these postings are coordinated by any well-known or official
organization is debatable. However, they are an example of information warfare. One person or
group of people attempt to sway opinion by flooding one particular media (Internet groups) with
various items advocating one view. If they are lucky, some individuals will copy the text and email
it to friends who do not participate in the newsgroups, thus crossing over to another media and
spreading opinions (in some cases entirely unfounded) far and wide.
ptg999
Actual Cases 263
FYI: Disinformation—A Historical Perspective
While disinformation campaigns are certainly easier to conduct since the advent of mass commu-
nication, particularly the Internet, such activities did exist prior to the Internet, or even television.
For example, in the weeks leading up the famous D-Day invasion of World War II, the Allied forces
used a number of disinformation techniques:
■ They created documents and communiqués listing fictitious military units that would invade
from an entirely different location than the real invasion was planned.
■ They used Allied double agents to spread similar disinformation to the Germans.
■ A few small groups simulated a large scale invasion to distract the German army.
Disinformation
Another category of information warfare that is closely related to propaganda is disinformation. It is a
given that a military opponent is attempting to gather information about troop movements, military
strength, supplies, and so forth. A prudent move would be to set up systems that had incorrect infor-
mation and were just secure enough to be credible, but not secure enough to be unbreakable. An
example would be to send an encrypted coded message such that, when the message is decrypted, it
seems to say one thing, but to those who can complete the code it has a different message. The actual
message is “padded” with “noise.” That noise is a weakly encrypted false message, whereas the real
message is more strongly encrypted. In this way, if the message is decrypted, there exists a high like-
lihood that the fake message will be decrypted and not the real one. General Gray, USMC, put it best
when he said, “Communications without intelligence is noise; intelligence without communications is
irrelevant” (Information Warfare, 2004).
The goal of any military or intelligence agency is to make certain our communications are clear and
that the enemy can only receive noise.
Actual Cases
It should be noted that there are voices in the computer security industry that think cyber terrorism or
cyber war are simply not realistic scenarios. Marcus Ranum of Information Security magazine states as
much in the April 2004 issue. He and others claim that there is no danger from cyber terrorism and that,
in fact, “The whole notion of cyberwarfare is a scam” (Information Security, 2004). However,
computer warfare and cyber terrorism have already been used on a small scale. It seems quite plausible
that, in a matter of time, it will be seen on a much larger scale.
Even if you believe that the scenarios outlined in the earlier sections of this chapter are merely the
product of an overactive imagination, you should consider that there have already been a few actual
incidents of cyber terrorism, although much less severe than the theoretical scenarios. This section
examines some of these cases so as to show you how such attacks have been carried out in the past.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare264
The incidents listed below were reported in testimony before the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism
Committee on Armed Services U.S. House of Representatives (Cyberterrorism, 2000). Earlier in this
chapter, we listed more recent attacks, but these older attacks are important to illustrate just how long
this problem has been going on.
■ In 1996, a computer hacker allegedly associated with the white supremacist movement tem-
porarily disabled a Massachusetts ISP and damaged part of the ISP’s record-keeping system.
The ISP had attempted to stop the hacker from sending out worldwide racist messages under
the ISP’s name. The hacker signed off with the threat, “You have yet to see true electronic ter-
rorism. This is a promise.”
■ In 1998, ethnic Tamil guerrillas swamped Sri Lankan embassies with 800 emails a day over a
two-week period. The messages read, “We are the Internet Black Tigers and we’re doing this to
disrupt your communications.” Intelligence authorities characterized it as the first known attack
by terrorists against a country’s computer systems.
■ During the Kosovo conflict in 1999, NATO computers were blasted with email bombs and hit
with denial of service attacks by hacktivists (the name applied to individuals who work for their
causes using cyber terrorism) protesting the NATO bombings. In addition, businesses, public
organizations, and academic institutes received highly politicized virus-laden emails from a
range of Eastern European countries, according to reports. Web defacements were also com-
mon. After the Chinese embassy was accidentally bombed in Belgrade, Chinese hacktivists
posted messages such as, “We won’t stop attacking until the war stops!” on U.S. government
websites.
The good news is that these particular attacks caused little damage and were clearly the product of
amateurs. However, it may only be a matter of time before more-damaging attacks are perpetrated by
far more skilled cyber terrorists. Yet it is clear that cyber terrorism, at least on a low–intensity scale, is
already beginning. These warnings can be heeded and the issues taken seriously, or they can simply be
ignored until disaster strikes.
In addition to those cases listed above, there have been other credible threats or actual incidents of
cyber attacks in the past several years:
■ In 2002, Counterpane Internet Security reported (as shown in Figure 12.3) a credible threat of a
Chinese-backed, all-out cyber attack planned on the United States and Taiwan (2002). A private
group of Chinese hackers, called the Chinese Eagle Union, planned to attack routers and web
servers across the United States and Taiwan. The attack never materialized, but unconfirmed re-
ports suggested that the CIA took the threat seriously.
ptg999
Actual Cases 265
FIGURE 12.3 Counterpane Internet Security report on a planned cyber attack.
■ In June of 2000, Russian authorities arrested a man they accused of being a CIA-backed hacker.
As shown in Figure 12.4, this man allegedly hacked into systems of the Russian Domestic Se-
curity Service (FSB) and gathered secrets that he then passed on to the CIA (BBC Report,
2000). This example illustrates the potential for a skilled hacker using his knowledge to conduct
espionage operations. This espionage is likely occurring much more often than is reported in
the media, and many such incidents may never come to light.
FYI: The Threat of Cyber Terrorism
Fortunately, to date, the examples given in this text are about the most dramatic that have been made
public. Cyber terrorism is not a big problem today; it is the problem that is looming on our horizon. 
Alternative media sources have been reporting that both the CIA and NSA have employed hackers for
some time. This might be easily dismissed as false were it not for the fact that such hackers have
actually been caught, as in the Russian story. One might even go so far as to say that, in our modern
age, for intelligence gathering agencies not to employee cyber intelligence-gathering techniques would
be a dereliction of their duty.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare266
FIGURE 12.4 BBC report on an arrested hacker.
What is also frightening to consider are reports that our satellites, used for communication, weather,
and military operations, could be vulnerable to hacking (Info World, 2002). Such vulnerabilities seem
less likely simply because of the skill level required to execute such an attack. As previously
mentioned, hacking/cracking is like any other human endeavor—by the law of averages, most people
are mediocre. The level of skill required to compromise security on a satellite system is far greater than
that required to compromise the security of a website. Of course, that does not mean that such an attack
is impossible, but simply that it is less likely.
Future Trends
By carefully analyzing what is occurring presently in cyber crime and terrorism along with the recent
history of that field, you can extrapolate and make reasonably accurate estimates for what trends will
dominate in the near future. This section will endeavor to do that. There are certainly positive and
negative trends that should be considered.
ptg999
Future Trends 267
Positive Trends
It does seem that various governments are beginning to take notice of this problem and are taking some
steps to ameliorate the dangers. For example, then Senator John Edwards (D-NC) proposed two bills in
2002 aimed at allocating $400 million for cybersecurity efforts. The first measure, called the Cyberter-
rorism Preparedness Act of 2002 (Tech Law, 2002), a portion of which is shown in Figure 12.5, allo-
cated $350 million over five years for improving network security, first for federal systems and then for
the private sector. It would also create a group assigned to gather and distribute information about the
best security practices. The Cybersecurity Research and Education Act of 2002 (The Orator, 2002), a
portion of which is shown in Figure 12.6, would provide $50 million over four years for fellowships
that would be used to train IT specialists in cyber security. It also calls for the creation of a web-based
university where administrators can get updated training. The Cybersecurity Research and Education
act was passed and became Public Law 107-305. The Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002 was
not passed. However, many of its goals where addressed by the Patiort Act.
FIGURE 12.5 The Cyberterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002.
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare268
FIGURE 12.6 The Cybersecurity Research and Education Act of 2002.
Title VIII of the U.S. Patriot Act specifically deals with cyber terrorism. The number of cyber attacks
included in that definition of cyber terrorism is expansive, including attempts to damage or alter
medical records and releasing a virus in a target system. Penalties are also clearly set out.
More recently, in 2010 the United States Department of Defense established the U.S. Cyber Command
(USCYBERCOM). This unit is based in Ft. Meade, Maryland, and is a joint task force representing
components of all four U.S. armed services.
Negative Trends
Unfortunately, as legislative bodies become aware of this problem and focus some resources on the
issue, the threats continue to grow. In a paper commissioned by the Rand Corporation (Hoffman,
2003), it is noted that even groups such as Al Qaeda—who have not used cyber terrorism as one of their
attack modalities as of this writing—have used Internet and computer technology resources to plan
their various activities and coordinate training.
As early as 2000, the U.S. General Accounting Office warned of several possible cyber terrorism
scenarios (The Tech Law Journal, 2000). As shown in Figure 12.7, their concerns involved far more
ptg999
Defense against Cyber Terrorism 269
lethal attackers than any of the scenarios that have been outlined in this chapter. They proposed
possible attack scenarios in which the computer-controlled machinery in a chemical plant was altered
in order to cause a release of toxic chemicals into the environment. This could be done in a variety of
ways, including simply causing the machinery to drastically overproduce, overheat, or perhaps prema-
turely shut down equipment. The panel also contemplated scenarios in which water and power supplies
were interrupted or compromised via computer systems. In essence, their focus was on the potential for
massive casualties as a direct result of a cyber-based attack rather than the economic damage on which
this chapter’s scenarios focused.
FIGURE 12.7 Rand report on cyber terrorism.
Defense against Cyber Terrorism
As the world becomes more dependent upon computer systems, the danger of cyber terrorism will
grow. Clearly, there must be a much stronger emphasis on computer security. In addition to the basic
security measures already recommended in this book, there are also some recommendations for
preparing for and protecting systems against cyber terrorism:
ptg999
CHAPTER 12 Cyber Terrorism and Information Warfare270
■ Many recommend a Manhattan Project-level government program designed to prepare for and
defend against cyber warfare.
■ Major academic institutions must begin dedicated research and academic programs that are
devoted solely to computer security.
■ Computer crime must be treated far more seriously, with stronger punishments and more active
investigation of suspected crimes.
■ It is unreasonable to ask every police department to have a computer-crime specialist on staff.
However, state-level investigative agencies should be able to hire such personnel. Rather than
take law enforcement officers and train them in basic computer crime, the recommendation
exists to take highly skilled computer professionals and train them in law enforcement. To
adequately combat cyber terrorism, one absolutely must first and foremost be a highly qualified
computer expert.
■ An emergency reporting system may need to be implemented so that security professionals
from various industries have a single source where they can report attacks on their systems and
can view the issues with which other security professionals are dealing. This could enable secu-
rity professionals as a group to more quickly recognize when a coordinated attack is occurring.
In addition, you can make some additions to and variations on your existing security measures. For
example, you should have a recovery process in place so that data can be quickly recovered should
someone delete important files. You should also, as recommended in Chapter 9, assess what data is of
most value and focus your attention on that data. But, as this chapter points out, you must also consider
how data that would at first appear to be of less value may actually reveal more information about you
personally or your company than is prudent.

Summary
It is clear that there are a variety of ways in which cyber terrorist attacks could be used against any
industrialized nation. Many experts, including various government panels, senators, and terrorism
experts, believe that this is a very real threat. This means that it is more important than ever to be
extremely vigilant in securing your computer systems. You must also look beyond the obvious uses of
data and see how someone with an intent to harm or cause economic hardship could use seemingly
unimportant information. In the exercises at the end of this chapter, you will have a chance to explore
various cyber terrorism and information warfare threats.

Introduction
In the preceding chapters we have examined many facets of computer security. Three of those issues
lead us to the content of this chapter. The first is identity theft, the second is hacking, and the third is
investigating potential employees for sensitive positions.
In order for a criminal to perpetrate identity theft they have to take a small amount of information they
find on their target and use that to garner even more information. Perhaps a discarded credit card
receipt or utility bill becomes the starting point from which the perpetrator finds enough information to
assume the victim’s identity. This chapter will show you some techniques that use the Internet to find
additional information about a person. You need to be aware of how this is done, in order to be better
prepared to defend against it and so that you are aware of what information about you personally is
available.
Hackers, at least skilled hackers, will want information about a target person, organization, and system
in order to assist in compromising security. Whether the perpetrator is attempting to use social engi-
neering or simply trying to guess a password, having information about the target will facilitate the
task. Once you realize how easy it is to gain personal information about someone, you will realize why
Chapter 13
276
ptg999
General Searches 277
security experts are so adamant that you must not use passwords that are in any way associated with
you, your profession, your hobbies, or anything that might be traced back to you.
Finally, when you are hiring employees that might have access to sensitive data, simply calling the
references they provide is not an adequate method of checking into their background. And hiring a
private investigator may be impractical. The information in this chapter might be of use to you in
conducting some level of investigation on your own.
This may surprise some readers, but network administrators are of particular significance to be investi-
gated before hiring. Most companies perform the same cursory check of network administrators as
they do of any other person. That usually consists of verifying degrees/certifications and calling refer-
ences. With some companies it might include a credit check and a local criminal check. However, a
network administrator should be more thoroughly investigated. The reason is quite simple, regardless
of how tight your security is, it cannot keep out the person who sets it up and maintains it. If you are
considering hiring a network administrator for your company, knowing that he or she has been affil-
iated with hacking groups might be of interest to you. Or simply knowing that they have had lapses in
judgment might indicate a stronger possibility that they will have similar lapses in the future. This may
seem a bit paranoid, but by this point in this book you should have developed a little healthy paranoia.
The Internet can be a valuable investigation tool. It can be used to find out about potential employees,
babysitters, etc. Much of the information on the Internet is also free. Many states have court records
online, and there are many other resources you can use to find information. In this chapter, we will
examine some of the various resources you can use on the Internet to locate critical information.
Before beginning this discussion, a few points need to be made clear, the first being that this infor-
mation is a two-edged sword. Yes, you can use it to find out if a potential business partner has previ-
ously been sued or declared bankruptcy or if your child’s little league coach has a criminal record.
However, as we briefly mentioned, a less-scrupulous person can also use these techniques to gather
detailed information about you, either for the purpose of identity theft or perhaps stalking. Some
people have suggested to me that perhaps I should not put this information (and some other items that
appear in various chapters) in this book. However, my opinion is that the hackers, crackers, and perpe-
trators of identity theft already know about these resources. My hope is to level the playing field. I
would also warn all readers that invading other people’s privacy is fraught with ethical, moral, and in
many cases, legal ramifications. It would be advisable to obtain written permission before running a
background check on any person—or, better yet, play it safe and only perform searches on your own
name. It must also be stressed that I am neither an attorney nor a law enforcement officer. I am simply
providing you with techniques and resources. If you have questions about legality, you should refer
those questions to an attorney.
General Searches
Sometimes you simply want to find an address, phone number, or email address for a person. Or
perhaps that is the starting point for a more thorough investigation. There are a number of absolutely
ptg999
CHAPTER 13 Cyber Detective278
free services on the Web that will allow you to perform this sort of search. Some are better than others,
and obviously the more common the name you are searching for the harder it will be to find the right
one. If you do a search for John Smith in California, you might have a tough time dealing with all the
results you get. No matter what search mechanism you utilize (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) the problem
is the same.
A fairly easy to use service is the Yahoo! People Search. When you go to www.yahoo.com you see a
number of options on the page. One option is the People Search shown in Figure 13.1. Or you can
simply go directly to people.yahoo.com.
FIGURE 13.1 Yahoo! People Search.
When you select this option you will see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 13.2. In this
screen, you enter a first and last name, as well as a city or state. You can then search for either a phone
number/address or an email. 
FIGURE 13.2 Search options.
ptg999
General Searches 279
To illustrate how this works, I did a search on my own name, in Texas (where I live). As Figure 13.3
shows, now it just so happens that I recently moved. The data shown is the old address, not the new
one. That illustrates that these searches are not perfect. It also shows an inaccurate phone number.
However, the address was accurate up until very recently. You may also note that in some cases (as with
mine) the search with options is the same as the search without. The issue is that I have a less common
last name. If you are searching for someone with a common name, then the options can be very useful
in refining your search.
FIGURE 13.3 People Search results.
Another useful site for addresses and phone numbers around the world is www.infobel.com. This site
has the advantage of being international, allowing you to seek out phone numbers and addresses in a
variety of countries. As you can see from Figure 13.4, the first step is to select a country to search in. 
FIGURE 13.4 Infobel home page.
ptg999
CHAPTER 13 Cyber Detective280
Once you have selected your country, you can then narrow your search further by providing as much
information as you can on the person you are trying to locate. A first and last name, however, is a
minimum.
These are just two of the many sites that allow you to investigate and discover a person’s home address
or telephone number. Several other good sites you should consider are listed here:
■ www.yellowpages.com
■ www.theultimates.com/white/
■ www.FaceBook.com
■ www.whowhere.com
■ www.switchboard.com
■ www.LinkedIn.com
It is important to remember that the more information you can provide, and the more you narrow down
your search, the greater the likelihood of finding what you are looking for. All of these websites can
assist you in finding phone numbers and addresses, both current and past. For a background check on
an employee, this can be useful in verifying previous addresses.
FYI: Respecting Privacy
You might wonder why I would be willing to put my home address and phone number in a
published book. To begin with, anyone reading this chapter could easily have done their own
search and found my information. And, in order to illustrate the process, I needed a name to use.
For the liability reasons mentioned earlier, I could not have used someone else’s name. However,
should readers wish to contact me, they are strongly encouraged to do so via my website
(www.chuckeasttom.com) and email address (chuckeasttom@yahoo.com) rather than via phone. I
try to answer all my email, but frequently avoid my phone. And I am certainly not encouraging
anyone to make a surprise visit to my home!
Court Records and Criminal Checks
A number of states are now putting a variety of court records online. Everything from general court
documents to specific records of criminal history and even lists of sex offenders. This sort of infor-
mation can be critical before you hire an employee, use a babysitter, or send your child to little league.
In the following sections, we discuss a variety of resources for this sort of information.
ptg999
Court Records and Criminal Checks 281
Sex Offender Registries
First, you should become familiar with the online sex offender registries. The FBI maintains a rather
exhaustive list of individual state registries. You can access this information at www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/cac/
Registry.htm. Every state that has an online registry is listed on this website, as shown in Figure 13.5. Obvi-
ously, some states have done a better job of making accurate information public than have others. For
example, Texas has a rather comprehensive site. You can find it at http://records.txdps.state.tx.us/. This site
allows you to either look up an individual person or to put in a ZIP code (or city name) and find out any
registered sex offenders in that area. Figure 13.6 shows the search screen for the Texas site mentioned. 
FIGURE 13.5 FBI state registry of sex offenders.
One of the most compelling things about the Texas sex offender registry is that it lists the offense the
person was convicted of as well as a photo of the offender. This is important since the term sex offender
covers a wide variety of crimes. Some of which may not, for example, impact whether you should hire
this person. It is important to know what a person was convicted of before you decide they are
unsuitable to be interacting with your children or working in your organization.
It should also be noted that there in an app for the iPhone/iPad called Offender Locator that will take
your GPS location and list registered sex offenders nearby.
Some sex offenders have committed heinous crimes and many parents will want to use this information
to find out about potential babysitters and coaches. This information may also be applicable to
employment screenings. However, anytime any information is used for employment screening, it is
advisable to check the laws in your area. You may not legally be able to base employment decisions on
certain information. As with all legal questions, your best course of action is to consult a reputable
attorney. 
ptg999
CHAPTER 13 Cyber Detective282
FIGURE 13.6 Texas sex offender search page.
Caution
Mistaken Identity
There have been cases of mistaken identity with sex offender lists. Any time you find negative
information on a person you are investigating—whatever the source—you have an ethical respon-
sibility to verify that information before you take any action on it.
Civil Court Records
There are a variety of crimes, as well as civil issues, a person might be involved in that would make
them unsuitable for a particular job. If you are hiring a person to work in your human resources
department and oversee equal opportunity issues, knowing if they had been involved in domestic
violence, racially motivated graffiti, or other similar issues, might affect your employment decision.
Or, if you are considering a business partnership, it would be prudent to discover if you prospective
partner has ever been sued by other business partners, or has ever filed for bankruptcy. Unfortunately,
in any of these cases, you cannot simply rely on the other parties’ honesty. You need to check these
things out for yourself.
ptg999
Court Records and Criminal Checks 283
Unfortunately, this area of legal issues has not been transferred to a web format as well as sex crimes.
However, many states and federal courts do offer online records. One of the best organized and most
complete on this issue is the state of Oklahoma. You can find their website at www.oscn.net/
applications/oscn/casesearch.asp, and their home search page is shown in Figure 13.7. 
FIGURE 13.7 Oklahoma online court records.
This site allows you to search by last name, last and first name, case number, and more. You will get a
complete record of any case you find, including current disposition and any filings. This includes both
civil and criminal proceedings. Oddly enough, there are at least five different websites offering infor-
mation on Oklahoma court cases for a fee—when all of that information is online and free. This illus-
trates a key point to keep in mind. There are a number of sites/companies that offer to do searches for
you, for fees ranging from $9.95 to $79.95. It is true that they can probably do it faster than you. But it
is also true that you can find the exact same information these people do, for free. And hopefully this
chapter will equip you with the information you need to do that successfully.
ptg999
CHAPTER 13 Cyber Detective284
Other Resources
There are many other websites that can be quite helpful for your searches. There are a few that deserve
particular attention. The National Center for State Courts has a website at www.ncsconline.org/D_KIS/
info_ court_web_sites.html that lists links to state courts all over the United States. It also lists several
international courts in countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This website, as
shown in Figure 13.8, is an excellent starting point if you are seeking court records. There is a government
access site that helps you find all federal courts. That website is www.uscourts.gov/court_locator.aspx.
FIGURE 13.8 National Center for State Courts website.
The following list is designed to give you a starting point for online searches across the United States.
These websites should help you start your search for court records:
■ Pacer: www.pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/
■ Prison searches: www.ancestorhunt.com/prison_search.htm
■ Federal prison records: www.bop.gov/
■ Public records: www.searchsystems.net/
■ United Kingdom public records: www.pro.gov.uk/
■ The Bureau of Federal Prisons: www.bop.gov/
ptg999
Usenet 285
As you begin searching the Internet, you will find other sites that appeal to you. This may be due to
their ease of use, content, or other factors. When you do find such sites, bookmark them. In a short
time, you will have an arsenal of online search engines. Also, your proficiency with using them will
increase and you will learn which to use for which kind of information. This will allow you to become
adept at quickly finding information that you need online.
Usenet
Many readers who are new to the Internet (in the past five years) may not be familiar with Usenet.
Usenet is a global group of bulletin boards that exist on any subject you can imagine. There are specific
software packages used to view these newsgroups, but for some time now they have been accessible
via web portals. The search engine Google has an option on their main page called Groups. When you
click on that option, you are taken to Google’s portal to Usenet newsgroups, as shown in Figure 13.9. 
FIGURE 13.9 Google access to Usenet groups.
Caution
Usenet Information
Anyone can post anything on Usenet. There are no restrictions at all. So simply because you
find a negative comment about a person on Usenet, it is not wise to automatically assume that
comment is true. These postings can only be viewed as part of an investigation and only credi-
ble if other facets of the investigation also support the postings you find.
ptg999
CHAPTER 13 Cyber Detective286
As you can see, newsgroups are divided into broad categories. For example newsgroups devoted to
science topics would be found under the heading sci. This includes groups like sci.anthropology,
sci.logic, sci.math.stat, and more. The heading alt is a catchall for anything and everything. This
category includes things ranging from alt.hacking to alt.adoption. 
You may be thinking that, while all this is fascinating, it does not have anything to do with tracking
down information. But actually it does. If, for example, you were hiring a network administrator, you
could see if she had posted in various network administration groups, and if those postings revealed
key information about her network. This tool may be the single most important investigative tool you
have, if you are willing to take the time and ferret out the information you need.

Summary
We have seen in this chapter that the Internet can be a valuable resource for any sort of investigation. It is
often one of the tools that hackers and identity thieves use to gain information about their target. However,
it can also be a valuable tool for you in researching a prospective employee or business partner. It can also
be invaluable for you to routinely find out what information is on the Internet about you. Seeing strange

EXERCISES
For all exercises and projects in this chapter, you will concentrate your investigation on some person.
It is best if you investigate yourself (which makes it easier to evaluate the accuracy of what you find)
or if someone in the class or the instructor volunteers to be the target of the investigation. There are
ethical issues with simply investigating random people without their knowledge or permission. It is
also important to avoid embarrassing someone in the classroom. So the volunteer targets of the inves-
tigation should be certain they will not be embarrassed by whatever is found. Substitute the name of
the person you are investigating for John Doe or Jane Doe in the projects and exercises.
EXERCISE 13.1: Finding Phone Numbers
1. Beginning with Yahoo! People Search, seek out phone numbers and addresses for John Doe.
2. Use at least two other sources to look up John’s phone number.
Did you get too little information or too much information? Were you able to determine the correct,
current number?
EXERCISE 13.2: Criminal Records Checks
1. Using sources listed in this chapter or other websites, look for criminal background informa-
tion about John Doe. Start with the state John currently resides in, then check other states, par-
ticularly those that might have shown up with John’s name in Exercise 1.
2. Expand your search to check for federal crimes as well.
EXERCISE 13.3: Checking Court Cases
1. Search court records for any court cases for Jane Doe’s business.
2. Check state licensing agency websites, if applicable, for any history or complaints on John’s
business.
EXERCISE 13.4: Finding Business Information on Usenet
1. Access Usenet.
2. Search bulletin boards and other groups that Jane Doe may have posted to in connection with
her business.
Were you able to find out more about Jane’s business through her postings to a Usenet group?

Test Your Skills 291
EXERCISE 13.5: Blocking Information
This chapter illustrated the many ways you can access information about someone and pointed out the
potential hazards of having too much personal information available on the Internet. So, what can you do
to prevent unscrupulous individuals from finding out too much about you? Check the primary websites
listed in this chapter (i.e., Yahoo! and Google) to see if they provide any means to block your information
from being distributed. Are there any other means of blocking access to your personal information?
PROJECTS
PROJECT 13.1: Investigating a Person
Using all of the web resources in this chapter, and any others you come across, do a complete investi-
gation of Jane Doe. Try to determine her address, phone number, occupation, age, and any criminal
history. You might even check Usenet postings and find out clues as to Jane’s hobbies and personal
interests as well. Create a brief report on Jane based on your findings.
PROJECT 13.2: Investigating a Company
Using all of the web resources in this chapter, and any others you come across, do a complete investiga-
tion of John Doe’s business. How long has he been in business? Are there any complaints about the busi-
ness with any regulatory agency? Any complaints on Usenet boards? Any business relationships? Any
past court proceedings? Write a report discussing your analysis of this business based on your findings.
PROJECT 13.3: The Ethics of Investigation
Write an essay discussing the ethics of online investigations. Do you feel these investigations are an
invasion of privacy? Why or why not? If you do feel they are an invasion of privacy, what do you
think can be done about it? Are there problems with getting inaccurate information?
Case Study
Henry Rice, the owner and CEO of a small company, has been conducting a search for a new
human resource administrator. After many rounds of interviews, he has narrowed his search down
to two individuals that he feels are the best candidates. Each has very similar qualifications so
Henry’s decision may very well be based on the information he finds when he checks their refer-
ences and performs a background check.
Henry has received written permission from each to conduct a background check. Where should
Henry begin his search? What sites or sorts of information would be most critical for him to
check? What type of information could weigh heavily for a person working in human resources?
Write a brief essay outlining the steps Henry should take in conducting his research.

Introduction to Forensics
Chapter Objectives
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises, you will be able
to do the following:
■ Understand basic forensics principles
■ Make a forensic copy of a drive
■ Use basic forensics tools
Introduction
In the preceding 13 chapters, you have been introduced to a variety of security topics: from concepts
like the CIA triangle, to attacks such as session hijacking, to counter measures like IDS and honey
pots. In this chapter, we are going to cover the basics of computer forensics. This is a very important
topic for anyone involved in computer security or network administration. It is frequently the case that
the first responder to a computer crime is the network administrator, not a law enforcement officer. And
if you fail to handle the evidence properly, you may render it unusable in a court and ruin any chances
of convicting the perpetrator.
However, remember that the steps outlined in this chapter are general guidelines. You should definitely
consult whatever forensics standards are used in your jurisdiction. If you are not a law enforcement
officer, you will still want to familiarize yourself with the procedures used by local law enforcement
and to follow the same steps. If for some reason you cannot acquire the procedures used by your local
law enforcement agency, then you can find federal guidelines. Here are some sources:
■ United States Secret Service: www.secretservice.gov/ectf.shtml
■ Federal Bureau of Investigation: www.cert.org/tech_tips/FBI_investigates_crime.html
■ FBI Computer Forensics: www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/august/rcfls_081809
Chapter 14

ptg999
General Guidelines 293
It is also important to keep in mind that a few jurisdictions have passed laws requiring that in order to
extract the evidence the investigator must be either a law enforcement officer or a licensed private
investigator. This is a controversial law, given that normally private investigator training and licensing
does not include computer forensics training. You should check with specifics in your state. However,
many of those states will allow you to forensically examine a computer if you have the permission of
the owner. So this would not prohibit you from forensically examining computers in your company.

There are some general guidelines you should always follow in any forensic examination. You want to
have as little impact on the evidence as possible. This means you want to examine it, and not to alter it.
You want to have a clear document trail for everything that is done. And of course you want to secure
your evidence.
Don’t Touch the Suspect Drive
The first, and perhaps most important, is to touch the system as little as possible. You do not want to
make changes to the system in the process of examining it. Let’s look at one possible way to make a
forensically valid copy of a drive. Some of this depends on Linux commands, which you may or may
not be familiar with. If you are not, I have had students with no Linux experience use these same
commands and be able to accomplish the task of making a forensic copy of a drive.
First you will need a bootable copy of Linux. Some books recommend Knoppix, but I have found Back-
Track to be more consistently reliable. You will actually need two copies. One on the suspect machine
and one on the target machine. Whichever version of Linux you use, the steps will be the same:
First you have to completely wipe the target drive. 
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb1 bs=2048
Now we need to set up that target forensics server to receive the copy of the suspected drive we wish to
examine. The Netcat command helps with that. The specific syntax is as follows:
nc –l –p 8888 > evidence.dd
We are telling the machine to listen on port 8888 and put whatever it receives into evidence.dd.
Now on the suspect machine we have to start sending the drive’s information to the forensics server:
dd if=/dev/hda1 | nc 192.168.0.2 8888 –w 3
Of course, this assumes that the suspect drive is hda1. If not, then replace that part of the command
with the partition you are using. This also assumes the server has an IP address of 192.168.0.2. If not,
replace with whatever your forensics server IP address is.
ptg999
CHAPTER 14 Introduction to Forensics294
You will also want to create a hash of the suspect drive. Later you can hash the drive you have been
working with and compare that to the hash of the original drive and confirm that nothing has been
altered. You can make a hash using Linux shell commands:
md5sum /dev/hda1 | nc 192.168.0.2 8888 –w 3
When you are done, you have a copy of the drive. It is often a good idea to make two copies: One you
will work with, and another will simply be stored. But in no case do you do your forensic analysis on
the suspect drive.
Document Trail
Beyond not touching the actual drive, the next issue is documentation. If you have never worked in any
investigative capacity, the level of documentation may seem onerous to you. But the rule is simple:
Document everything.
When you first discover a computer crime, you must document exactly what events occurred. Who was
present and what were they doing? What devices were attached to the computer, what connections did
it have over the network/Internet? What hardware was being used and what operating system?
Then when you begin your actual forensic investigation you must document every step. Start with
documenting the process you use to make a forensic copy. Then document every tool you use, every
test you perform. You must be able to show in your documentation everything that was done.
Secure the Evidence
First and foremost, the computer must be taken offline to prevent further tampering. Now there are
some limited circumstances where a machine would be left online to trace down an active, ongoing
attack. But the general rule is take it offline immediately. 
The next step is to limit access to the machine. No one who does not absolutely need access to the
evidence should have it. Hard drives should be locked in a safe or secure cabinet. Analysis should be
done in a room with limited access. 
You must also be able to document every person who had access to the evidence, how they interacted
with it, and where the evidence was stored. There must be no period of time that you cannot account
for the evidence. This is called chain of custody.
FBI Forensics Guidelines
Beyond the general guidelines we have just discussed, the FBI gives some specific guidelines. In most
cases, they will overlap with what we have discussed, but it is still useful to cover the FBI recommen-
dations.
ptg999
Finding Evidence on the PC 295
If an incident occurs, the FBI recommends that the first responder preserve the state of the computer at
the time of the incident by making a backup copy of any logs, damaged or altered files, and of course
any files left by the intruder. This last part is critical. Hackers frequently use various tools and may
leave traces of their presence. Furthermore the FBI warns that if the incident is in progress, activate any
auditing or recording software you might have available. Collect as much data about the incident as
you can. In other words, this might be a case where you do not take the machine offline, but rather
analyze the attack in progress.
Another important step is to document the specific losses suffered due to the attack. Losses typically
include the following:
■ Labor cost spent in response and recovery. (Multiply the number of participating staff by their
hourly rates.) 
■ If equipment was damaged, the cost of that equipment.
If data was lost or stolen, what was the value of that data? How much did it cost to obtain that
data and how much will it cost to reconstruct it?
■ Any lost revenue, including losses due to downtime, having to give customers credit due to in-
convenience, or any other way in which revenue was lost.
Documenting the exact damages due to the attack is just as important as documenting the attack itself.
The FBI computer forensic guidelines stress the importance of securing any evidence. The FBI also
stresses that you should not limit your concept of computer evidence to PCs and laptops. Computer
evidence can include the following:
■ Logs (system, router, chat room, IDS, firewall, etc.)
■ Portable storage devices (USB drives, external drives, etc.)
■ Emails
■ Devices capable of storing data such as iPod, iPad, tablets
■ Cell phones
The FBI guidelines also stress making a forensic copy of the suspect drive/partition to work with and
creating a hash of that drive.
Finding Evidence on the PC
Once you have secured the evidence and made a forensic copy, it is time to start looking for evidence.
That evidence can come in many forms.
ptg999
CHAPTER 14 Introduction to Forensics296
Finding Evidence in the Browser
The browser can be a source of both direct evidence and circumstantial or supporting evidence. Obvi-
ously in cases of child pornography, the browser might contain direct evidence of the specific crime.
You may also find direct evidence in the case of cyber stalking. However, if you suspect someone of
creating a virus that infected a network, you would probably only find indirect evidence such as the
person having searched virus creation/programming-related topics.
Even if the person erases his history, it is still possible to retrieve it. Windows stores a lot of infor-
mation in a file called index.dat (information such as web addresses, search queries, and recently
opened files). There are a number of tools you can download from the Internet that will allow you to
retrieve and review the index.dat file. Here are a few:
■ www.eusing.com/Window_Washer/Index_dat.htm
■ www.acesoft.net/index.dat%20viewer/index.dat_viewer.htm
■ http://download.cnet.com/Index-dat-Analyzer/3000-2144_4-10564321.html
Finding Evidence in System Logs
Regardless of what operating system you are using, the operating system has logs. Those logs can be
critical in any forensic investigation and you should retrieve them.
Windows Logs
Let’s start with Windows XP/Vista/7. With all of these versions of Windows, you find the logs by
clicking on the Start button in the lower-left corner of the desktop and then clicking the Control Panel.
You then will click on Administrative Tools and the Event Viewer. Here are the logs you would check
for. (Note that not all appear in every version of Windows.)
NOTE: With all of these you have to turn the logging on; otherwise, there will be nothing in these logs.
■ Security log: This is probably the most important log from a forensics point of view. It has
both successful and unsuccessful login events. 
■ Application log: This log contains various events logged by applications or programs. Many
applications will record their errors here in the application log. 
■ System log: The System log contains events logged by Windows system components. This
includes events like driver failures. This particular log is not as interesting from a forensics
perspective as the other logs are.
■ ForwardedEvents log: The ForwardedEvents log is used to store events collected from remote
computers. This will only have data in it, if event forwarding has been configured.
■ Applications and Services logs: This log is used to store events from a single application or
component rather than events that might have systemwide impact. 
ptg999
Finding Evidence in System Logs 297
Windows servers will have similar logs. However with Windows systems you have an additional
possible concern. It is possible that the attacker cleared the logs before leaving the system. There are
tools that will allow one to wipe out a log. It is also possible to simply turn off logging before an attack
and turn it back on when you are done. One such tool is auditpol.exe. Using auditpol \\ipaddress
/disable turns off logging. Then when the criminal exits they can use auditpol \\ipaddress
/enable to turn it back on. There are also tools, like WinZapper, that allow one to selectively remove
certain items from event logs in Windows
Linux Logs
Obviously Linux also has logs you can check. Depending on your Linux distribution and what services
you have running on it (like MySQL), some of these logs may not be present on a particular machine:
■ /var/log/faillog: This log file contains failed user logins. This can be very important when
tracking attempts to crack into the system.
■ /var/log/kern.log: This log file is used for messages from the operating system’s kernel. This is
not likely to be pertinent to most computer crime investigations.
■ /var/log/lpr.log: This is the printer log and can give you a record of any items that have been
printed from this machine. That can be useful in corporate espionage cases.
■ /var/log/mail.*: This is the mail server log and can be very useful in any computer crime inves-
tigation. Emails can be a component in any computer crime, and even in some noncomputer
crimes such as fraud.
■ /var/log/mysql.*: This log records activities related to the MySQL database server and will
usually be of less interest to a computer crime investigation.
■ /var/log/apache2/*: If this machine is running the Apache web server, then this log will show
related activity. This can be very useful in tracking attempts to hack into the web server.
■ /var/log/lighttpd/*: If this machine is running the Lighttpd web server, then this log will show
related activity. This can be very useful in tracking attempts to hack into the web server.
■ /var/log/apport.log: This records application crashes. Sometimes these can reveal attempts to
compromise the system or the presence of a virus or spyware.
■ /var/log/user.log: These contain user activity logs and can be very important to a criminal 
investigation.

CHAPTER 14 Introduction to Forensics298
Getting Back Deleted Files
It is a fact that criminals frequently attempt to destroy evidence. And this is also true with computer
crimes. The criminals may delete files. However there are a variety of tools you can use to recover such
files, particularly in Windows. Disk Digger is a free tool that can be used to recover Windows files.
This is a very easy to use tool. There are more robust tools, but the fact that this is free and easy to use
makes it perfect for students learning forensics. Let’s walk through its basic operation. 
On the first screen, shown in Figure 14.1, you simply select the drive/partition you wish to recover files
from.
FIGURE 14.1 Add a new scan.
On the next screen, you select the level of scan you want to do. This is shown in Figure 14.2. Obviously
the deeper the scan, the longer it can take.
Then you will get a list of the files that where recovered. You can see this in Figure 14.3. 
You can see the file and the file header. You can also choose to recover the file if you wish. Obviously,
it is possible that Disk Digger will only recover a file fragment. But that can be enough for forensics.

CHAPTER 14 Introduction to Forensics300
Operating System Utilities
There are a number of utilities built in to the operating system that can be useful in gathering some
forensic data. Given that Windows is the most commonly used operating system, we will focus on
those utilities that work from the Windows command line. However, one of the key issues in
conducting forensics work is to be very familiar with the target operating system. You should also note
that many of these commands are most useful on a live running system to catch attacks in progress.
Net Sessions
This command lists any active sessions connected to the computer you run it on. This can be very
important if you think an attack is live and ongoing. If there are no active sessions, the utility will
report that, as shown in Figure 14.4.
FIGURE 14.4 Net Sessions.
Openfiles
This is another command useful for finding live attacks ongoing. This command will list any shared
files that are currently open. You can see this utility in Figure 14.5.
FIGURE 14.5 Openfiles.
ptg999
The Windows Registry 301
Fc
Fc is a command you can use with a forensic copy of a machine. It compares two files and shows the
differences. If you think a configuration file has been altered you can compare it to a known good
backup. You can see this utility in Figure 14.6.
FIGURE 14.6 Fc.
Netstat
This command is also used to detect ongoing attacks. It lists all current network connections, not just
inbound, but outbound as well. You can see this utility in Figure 14.7.
FIGURE 14.7 Netstat.
The Windows Registry
The Windows Registry is an incredible repository of potential valuable forensics information. It is the
heart of the Windows machine. There are a number of interesting pieces of data you can find here. It is
beyond the scope of this chapter to make you an expert in the Windows Registry, but it is hoped that
ptg999
CHAPTER 14 Introduction to Forensics302
you will continue on and learn more. One important thing you can find, from a forensics perspective, is
any USB devices that have been connected to the machine.
The Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ControlSet\Enum\UBSTOR lists USB devices
that have been connected to the machine. It is often the case that a criminal will move evidence to an
external device and take it with them. This could indicate to you that there are devices you need to find
and examine.
