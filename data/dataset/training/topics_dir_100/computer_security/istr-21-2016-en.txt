INTRODUCTION
Symantec has established one of the most 
comprehensive sources of Internet threat data in the 
world through the Symantec™ Global Intelligence Network, 
which is made up of more than 63.8 million attack 
sensors and records thousands of events per second. 
This network monitors threat activity in over 157 countries 
and territories through a combination of Symantec 
products and services, such as Symantec DeepSight™ 
Intelligence, Symantec™ Managed Security Services, 
Norton™ consumer products, and other third-party data 
sources.
In addition, Symantec maintains one of the world’s most comprehensive vulnerability 
databases, currently consisting of more than 74,180 recorded vulnerabilities (spanning more 
than two decades) from over 23,980 vendors representing over 71,470 products.
Spam, phishing, and malware data is captured through a variety of sources, including the 
Symantec Probe Network, a system of more than five million decoy accounts, Symantec.
cloud, and a number of other Symantec security technologies. Skeptic™, the Symantec.
cloud proprietary heuristic technology, is able to detect new and sophisticated targeted 
threats before they reach customers’ networks. Over nine billion email messages are 
processed each month and more than 1.8 billion web requests filtered each day across 13 
data centers. Symantec also gathers phishing information through an extensive anti-fraud 
community of enterprises, security vendors, and more than 52 million consumers and 175 
million endpoints.
Symantec Website Security secures more than one million web servers worldwide with 
100 percent availability since 2004. The validation infrastructure processes over six billion 
Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) look-ups per day, which are used for obtaining the 
revocation status of X.509 digital certificates around the world. The Norton™ Secured Seal is 
displayed almost one billion times per day on websites in 170 countries and in search results 
on enabled browsers. 
These resources give Symantec analysts unparalleled sources of data with which to identify, 
analyze, and provide informed commentary on emerging trends in attacks, malicious code 
activity, phishing, and spam. The result is the annual Symantec Internet Security Threat 
Report, which gives enterprises, small businesses, and consumers essential information to 
secure their systems effectively now and into the future.

2016 Internet Security Threat Report 5
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Introduction
Symantec discovered more than 430 million new unique pieces of malware in 
2015, up 36 percent from the year before. Perhaps what is most remarkable 
is that these numbers no longer surprise us. As real life and online become 
indistinguishable from each other, cybercrime has become a part of our daily 
lives. Attacks against businesses and nations hit the headlines with such 
regularity that we’ve become numb to the sheer volume and acceleration of 
cyber threats.  
Most threat reports only scratch the surface of the threat landscape, whereas 
the breadth of Symantec’s data enables the Internet Security Threat Report 
(ISTR) to examine multiple facets, including targeted attacks, smartphone 
threats, social media scams, and Internet of Things (IoT) vulnerabilities, as well 
as attackers’ tactics, motivations, and behaviors. While there is much to be 
learned from this comprehensive view into the threat landscape, the following 
are six key findings and trends from 2015.
A New Zero-Day Vulnerability Was Discovered  
on Average Each Week in 2015
Advanced attack groups continue to profit from 
previously undiscovered flaws in browsers  
and website plugins 
In 2015, the number of zero-day vulnerabilities discovered 
more than doubled to 54, a 125 percent increase from the 
year before. Or put another way, a new zero-day vulner-
ability was found every week (on average) in 2015. In 
2013, the number of zero-day vulnerabilities (23) doubled 
from the year before. In 2014, the number held relatively 
steady at 24, leading us to conclude that we had reached a 
plateau. That theory was short-lived. The 2015 explosion in 
zero-day discoveries reaffirms the critical role they play in 
lucrative targeted attacks.
Given the value of these vulnerabilities, it’s not surpris-
ing that a market has evolved to meet demand. In fact, 
at the rate that zero-day vulnerabilities are being discov-
ered, they may become a commodity product. Targeted 
attack groups exploit the vulnerabilities until they are 
publicly exposed, then toss them aside for newly discov-
ered vulnerabilities. When The Hacking Team was exposed 
in 2015 as having at least six zero-days in its portfolio, it 
confirmed our characterization of the hunt for zero days 
as being professionalized.  
Vulnerabilities can appear in almost any type of software, 
but the most attractive to targeted attackers is software 
that is widely used. Again and again, the majority of these 
vulnerabilities are discovered in software such as Internet 
Explorer and Adobe Flash, which are used on a daily 
basis by a vast number of consumers and professionals. 
Four of the five most exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in 
2015 were Adobe Flash. Once discovered, the zero days 
are quickly added to cybercriminal toolkits and exploited. 
At this point, millions will be attacked and hundreds of 
thousands infected if a patch is not available, or if people 
have not moved quickly enough to apply the patch.

Over Half a Billion Personal Records  
Were Stolen or Lost in 2015
More companies than ever are not reporting  
the full extent of their data breaches
At the close of 2015, the world experienced the largest data 
breach ever publicly reported. An astounding 191 million 
records were exposed. It may have been the largest mega-
breach, but it wasn’t alone. In 2015, a record-setting total 
of nine mega-breaches were reported. (A mega-breach is 
defined as a breach of more than 10 million records.)
The total reported number of exposed identities jumped 
23 percent to 429 million. But this number hides a bigger 
story. In 2015, more and more companies chose not to 
reveal the full extent of the breaches they experienced. 
Companies choosing not to report the number of records 
lost increased by 85 percent. A conservative estimate by 
Symantec of those unreported breaches pushes the real 
number of records lost to more than half a billion.
The fact that companies are increasingly choosing to hold 
back critical details after a breach is a disturbing trend. 
Transparency is critical to security. While numerous data 
sharing initiatives are underway in the security industry, 
helping all of us improve our security products and 
postures, some of this data is getting harder to collect.
Major Security Vulnerabilities in Three Quarters 
of Popular Websites Put Us All at Risk
Web administrators still struggle to stay current  
on patches
There were over one million web attacks against people 
each and every day in 2015.  Many people believe that 
keeping to well-known, legitimate websites will keep them 
safe from online crime. This is not true. Cybercriminals 
continue to take advantage of vulnerabilities in legitimate 
websites to infect users, because website administrators 
fail to secure their websites. More than 75 percent of all 
legitimate websites have unpatched vulnerabilities. Fifteen 
percent of legitimate websites have vulnerabilities deemed 
‘critical,’ which means it takes trivial effort for cybercrim-
inals to gain access and manipulate these sites for their 
own purposes. It’s time for website administrators to step 
up and address the risks more aggressively.
Spear-Phishing Campaigns Targeting 
Employees Increased 55 Percent in 2015
Cyber attackers are playing the long game  
against large companies
In 2015, a government organization or a financial company 
targeted for attack once was most likely to be targeted 
again at least three more times throughout the year. 
Overall, large businesses that experienced a cyber attack 
saw an average of 3.6 successful attacks each.  
In the last five years, we have observed a steady increase 
in attacks targeting businesses with less than 250 
employees, with 43 percent of all attacks targeted at small 
businesses in 2015, proving that companies of all sizes are 
at risk. 
It’s not just Fortune 500 companies and nation states at 
risk of having IP stolen–even the local laundry service is 
a target. In one example, an organization of 35 employees 
was the victim of a cyber attack by a competitor. The 
competitor hid in their network for two years stealing 
customer and pricing information, giving them a signif-
icant advantage. This serves as a clear warning that all 
businesses are potentially vulnerable to targeted attacks. 
In fact, spear-phishing campaigns targeting employees 
increased 55 percent in 2015. No business is without risk. 
Attackers motivated purely by profit can be just as tech-
nically sophisticated and well-organized as any nation 
state-sponsored attackers. Take, for example, the Butterfly 
gang, who steal information to use in stock manipulation.
Ransomware Increased  
35 Percent in 2015
Cyber criminals are using encryption as a weapon to 
hold companies’ and individuals’ critical data hostage
Ransomware continues to evolve. Last year, we saw Cryp-
to-ransomware (encrypting files) push the less damaging 
locker-style ransomware (locking the computer screen) out 
of the picture. Crypto-style ransomware grew 35 percent 
in 2015. An extremely profitable type of attack, ransom-
ware will continue to ensnare PC users and expand to any 
network-connected device that can be held hostage for a 
profit. In 2015, ransomware found new targets and moved 
beyond its focus on PCs to smart phones, Mac, and Linux 
systems. Symantec even demonstrated proof-of-concept 
attacks against smart watches and televisions in 2015.

Symantec Blocked 100 Million Fake Technical 
Support Scams in 2015
Cyber scammers now make you call them  
to hand over your cash
While ransomware continues to grow as a threat, it is not 
the only threat that people face. As people conduct more 
of their lives online, attackers are finding new ways to lure 
victims. Fake technical support scams, first reported by 
Symantec in 2010, have evolved from cold-calling unsus-
pecting victims to the attacker fooling victims into calling 
them directly. Attackers trick people with pop-ups that alert 
them to a serious error or problem, thus steering the victim 
to an 800 number, where a “technical support representa-
tive” attempts to sell the victim worthless services. In 2015, 
Symantec blocked 100 million of these types of attacks.
Attackers continue to find ways to profit from what can 
be stolen online. Last year, Netflix expanded into new 
countries, attracting the attention of attackers. Symantec 
researchers discovered logins and passwords to legiti-
mate Netflix accounts being sold on the black market. The 
account access information was stolen via phishing or 
malware. Of course, reselling account access on the black 
market is not a new phenomenon. Symantec continues to 
see stolen hotel loyalty, airline frequent flyer, and gaming 
accounts advertised for sale on the black market.

THE INTERNET OF 
THINGS
SMARTPHONES  
AND MOBILE DEVICES
Smartphones are an increasingly 
attractive target for online criminals. 
As a result, they are investing in 
more sophisticated attacks that 
are effective at stealing valuable 
personal data or extorting money 
from victims. Although Android users 
remain the main target, 2015 saw 
effective attacks on Apple devices as 
well, and iOS devices did not need to 
be jail-broken to be compromised.
One Phone Per Person
The world bought more than 1.4 billion smartphones in 2015, up 
10 percent from the 1.3 billion units sold in the previous year, 
according to IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker 
(January 27, 2016). Five out of six new phones were running 
Android, with one in seven running Apple’s iOS operating 
system (Smartphone OS Market Share, 2015, Q2). One mobile 
manufacturer, Ericsson, predicts there could be as many as 6.4 
billion smartphone subscriptions by the end of 2020, almost one 
per person.
At the same time, high-end phones and tablets have powerful 
processors and with 4G network, they have high-bandwidth 
connectivity. They also contain valuable personal information. 
In 2015, Apple Pay launched in more countries around the 
world. With Samsung Pay and Android Pay also competing to 
manage the cards in your wallet, other mobile payment systems 
are likely to follow. All of this makes smartphones very attrac-
tive to criminals.

MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
Cross-Over Threats
With many app stores, users are able to browse, purchase, and 
remotely install apps from their desktop, providing a unique 
opportunity for a cross-over of threats. In one example with 
Google Play, customers can browse the Play Store from their 
computer using a normal web browser, installing apps directly 
onto their phone. Recent examples of some Windows malware 
have exploited this by stealing browser cookies for Google Play 
sessions from the infected desktop computer and using these 
stolen cookies (essentially the users’ credentials), impersonat-
ing the user to remotely install apps onto the victims’ phones 
and tablets without their knowledge or consent.

The number of mobile vulnerabilities has increased every year 
over the past three years. Unlike Android devices, iOS vulner-
abilities have been a critical part of gaining access to an iOS 
device, especially for jail-breaking. Jail-breaking enables a user 
to install apps that are not authorized on the Apple Store and 
bypasses the integral security of iOS. It is much more difficult to 
compromise a non-jailbroken device, as this typically requires 
an app to be installed by downloading it from the Apple Store. 
Apple is well-known for its stringent screening processes, which 
is why the number of malicious iOS apps is so much smaller 
than for Android.
In 2012, IOS.Finfish had been the first example of a malicious 
iOS app to be discovered in the Apple Store. Finfish was able to 
steal information from a compromised device. OSX.Wirelurker 
emerged in 2014, which used an attack involving USB connec-
tions to a Mac or PC, potentially enabling apps to be installed on 
non-jailbroken iOS devices. 
However, in 2015, attacks using XcodeGhost and YiSpecter were 
revealed not to require vulnerabilities, or to be jail-broken, in 
order to compromise an iOS device. We will be taking a closer 
look at these and other mobile threats later in this section. 
Mobile Vulnerabilities by Operating System
    T Vulnerabilities on the iOS platform have accounted for the greatest number 
of mobile vulnerabilities in recent years, with research often fueled by the 
interest to jail-break devices or gain unauthorized access to install malware.

Android Attacks Become More Stealthy
Android malware is becoming stealthier. For example, malware 
authors started to obfuscate code to bypass signature-based 
security software. Additionally, before they begin their attacks, 
some malware can now check to see if it is running on real 
phones or the kind of emulators or sandboxes that security 
researchers use.

How Malicious Video Messages Could  
Lead to Stagefright and Stagefright 2.0
No matter how quickly Google patches critical vulnerabilities in 
the Android OS, the speed at which end-users receive updates is 
dependent on their device manufacturers, and sometimes this can 
take longer. This was highlighted when on July 2015, seven vulner-
abilities were patched that could allow attackers to compromise 
affected devices by simply sending them a malicious multimedia 
message (MMS); all the intended victim had to do was to look at the 
malicious message, triggering an exploit.
The seven vulnerabilities involved were collectively known as 
the “Google Stagefright Media Playback Engine Multiple Remote 
Code Execution Vulnerabilities,” (CVE-2015-1538, CVE-2015-1539, 
CVE-2015-3824, CVE-2015-3826, CVE-2015-3827, CVE-2015-3828 
and CVE-2015-3829), and all were related to an Android component 
known as libStageFright, which handled media playback. Joshua 
Drake, from Zimperium zLabs, reported the vulnerabilities to 
Google in April and May 2015, raising further concerns that while 
Google had provided patches to its partners, many manufacturers 
took much longer providing patches to protect their customers. The 
severity of these vulnerabilities was compounded by the fact that 
despite the availability of a patch from Google, users remained at 
risk until carriers and manufacturers rolled out their own patches. 
This can often take weeks or months, and many older devices may 
never have a patch pushed out to them at all.
However, Google was keen to point out that devices with Android 
4.0 and higher (approximately 95% of active Android devices), 
have protection against a buffer overflow attack built-in, using a 
technology called Address Space Layout Randomization, (ASLR). 
Additionally, Android users were able to turn-off the automatic 
retrieval of multimedia messages through the built-in Messaging 
application, as well as through Google Hangouts.
Whilst this afforded partial mitigation, it could not prevent the 
vulnerabilities from being exploited if a malformed or malicious 
multimedia message was downloaded and opened.
In October 2015, two more Android vulnerabilities (CVE-2015-
6602 and CVE-2015-3876), similar to the original Stagefright bug, 
were disclosed. Again, if exploited they could allow an attacker to 
gain control of a compromised device, this time when the intended 
victim viewed a preview of an .mp3 or .mp4 file. By creating 
malicious audio or video files, attackers could entice a user to 
preview a song or video on an unpatched Android device. 
Google had previously patched the libStageFright library so it 
no longer automatically processed such messages; however, it 
remained possible for attackers to exploit libStageFright through 
the mobile browser. Dubbed Stagefright 2.0, these new vulnerabil-
ities could also be exploited through man-in-the-middle attacks 
and through third-party applications that still used Stagefright. 
Discovered and reported in August, the patches for these new 
vulnerabilities were included in Google’s October Monthly Security 
Update.

MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
Android Users under Fire with Phishing  
and Ransomware
Besides familiar tricks such as hiding malicious code inside 
ostensibly legitimate apps, or being disguised as something 
more useful, attackers are using more sophisticated techniques 
to make money from their victims. For example, Symantec 
researchers uncovered a new Android phishing Trojan that tricks 
users into entering their banking credentials by popping up a 
fake login page on top of legitimate banking apps. Similarly, the 
latest Android ransomware copies Google’s design style to make 
it appear more legitimate and intimidating when it displays fake 
FBI warnings on users’ lockscreens. We have also seen phone 
ransomware start to encrypt files, such as pictures, rather than 
simply change the phone’s access PIN.
Apple iOS Users Now More at Risk than Ever
Thanks to Apple’s tight control over its app store and operating 
system, threats to iPhones and iPads have been infrequent and 
limited in scale. This changed in 2015.
   T In 2015, we identified nine new iOS threat families, 
compared to four in total previously.
   T Bootlegged developer software, known as XcodeGhost, 
infected as many as 4,000 apps. 
   T The YiSpecter malware bypassed the app store altogether by 
using the enterprise app provisioning framework. 
   T Researchers found Youmi embedded in 256 iOS apps. This 
software is used in apps to display advertising, but also 
sends personal information to a remote location without 
users’ consent.
   T Vulnerabilities in Apple’s AirDrop wireless file transfer 
system could allow an attacker to install malware on an 
Apple device.
Ransomware Goes Mobile
    T Imagine the frustration of a user who downloads a cool new app to their 
phone only to find the device locked with an FBI warning on the home 
screen when they try to log in. 
    T They have two options: pay a ‘fine’ and hope that the attackers unlock the 
phone or give up access to precious photos, contacts, and memories.
iOS App Developers Haunted by XcodeGhost 
As Apple sells more and more iPads and iPhones, we believe that 
criminals will increasingly target them, drawn in part by the 
higher disposable income (on average) of their owners. However, 
owners and Apple users should no longer assume that Apple 
devices are immune from attack. In September 2015, malware 
was discovered in a number of iOS applications in China and was 
discovered in a number of legitimate Apple Store apps, including 
WeChat, a popular IM application. The problem was that these 
apps were not specifically designed to be malicious, but rather 
their developers had been compromised with malware that was 
embedded into the apps they were developing.
The malicious code, known as XcodeGhost (detected as 
OSX.Codgost), had been discovered in certain unofficial versions 
of Apple’s integrated development environment, Xcode. Develop-
ers of iOS applications that used these infected versions of Xcode 
were unknowingly allowing malicious code to be inserted into 
their own official iOS applications, putting their own users at risk.
If a user downloads and installs an infected app, XcodeGhost 
uploads information about the device to its command and 
control (C&C) server. The attacker would then be able to issue 
commands through the C&C server to perform actions including:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 14
MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
   T Creating fake phishing alerts to steal the victim’s username 
and password
   T Reading and writing data on the device’s clipboard, which 
could be used to uncover passwords copied from a password 
management tool
   T Hijacking the browser to open specific URLs, which could 
lead to further exploits
It has been estimated that hundreds of iOS apps on the Apple 
App Store were infected, potentially affecting hundreds of 
thousands of users, particularly in China, where the WeChat app 
is particularly popular.
This threat did not require a jailbroken iOS device, as with other 
iOS threats previously, making it a new and rather worrying 
development in the mobile threat landscape. Symantec blocked 
33 attacks in 2015, between September and December. Moreover, 
it wasn’t just Apple’s iOS that came under fire in 2015. Mac OS X, 
the company’s popular desktop operating system, also saw a rise 
in vulnerabilities, exploits, and threats during the year.
YiSpecter Shows How Attackers Now Have iOS 
Firmly in Their Sights 
In 2015, we saw an escalation in threats targeting the iOS 
platform, including YiSpecter (detected as IOS.Specter), which 
was also discovered in October 2015. YiSpecter was specifical-
ly designed to target Chinese speakers and has affected mainly 
users in East Asia, including China and Taiwan. 
YiSpecter is a Trojan horse that is able to exploit both jailbro-
ken and non-jailbroken iOS devices; it essentially provides a 
back door onto the compromised device and installs adware. 
The Trojan allows an attacker to accomplish a range of tasks, 
including uninstalling apps, downloading new fraudulent apps, 
and forcing other apps to display adverts.
Targeting Non-Jailbroken iOS Devices  
and Certificate Abuse 
YiSpecter was the first iOS threat that took advantage of Apple’s 
enterprise app provisioning framework to compromise non-jail-
broken devices. The framework is used by many businesses to 
legitimately deploy private apps to their workforce without 
having to make them publicly available on the official App Store. 
Apps are built and signed with enterprise certificates, and do 
not need to be vetted by Apple before being distributed outside 
of the App Store. This also affords more scope for businesses 
to develop apps with features that would otherwise be rejected 
by Apple, but could still be signed and deployed legitimately 
through the framework.
However, as demonstrated with YiSpecter, iOS enterprise certifi-
cates can also be used to package and sign their malware. It’s not 
known exactly how the attackers gained access to certificates, 
but it’s possible that they registered with Apple as an enterprise, 
paying the necessary fees and following the vetting procedure. 
Alternatively, they may have been able to steal legitimate certif-
icates from an already-registered developer or by partnering 
with one.
Once the attackers had access to a valid enterprise certificate, 
they were able to create, sign, and distribute their malicious 
apps, potentially to any iOS device, without any further inter-
vention from Apple. Of course, when Apple learns of the 
misuse of any enterprise certificate, it can be instantly revoked, 
rendering any apps signed by it useless. Enterprise-signed apps 
can generally only be installed once the user accepts the request 
to trust the app or developer. From experience, we know that 
asking the user whether they trust an app or developer is rarely 
an effective security measure, but it is one last line of defense 
that needs to be crossed before the malware can be installed.
Exploiting Apple’s Private APIs
One of the reasons that YiSpecter included more advanced func-
tionality was because it also used Apple’s own private APIs to 
perform activities that standard iOS apps cannot. These “private 
APIs” are reserved for Apple’s own apps to be able to perform 
a range of system-level actions. Other iOS developers are not 
supposed to use these APIs in their apps, and any third-par-
ty apps that do so are rejected from the Apple App Store. Of 
course, YiSpecter is able to circumvent the official App Store, 
instead relying on unofficial distribution channels to spread the 
malware. As a result, the threat is able to take advantage of the 
private APIs for its own purposes.
Cross-Platform Youmi Madware Pilfers 
Personal Data on iOS and Android 
In October 2015, Apple pulled as many as 256 apps from its App 
Store for apparently violating the company’s privacy guidelines. 
The apps had used third-party advertising technology from a 
company called Youmi (detected as Android.Youmi), which was 
secretly being used to access private information, including 
Apple ID email addresses and International Mobile Station 
Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers. 
Soon after this, the same advertising library was discovered in a 
number of Android apps, where it was being used to perform a 
range of actions that could also compromise the user’s privacy, 
including harvesting their GPS location and phone number, as 
well as downloading additional, potentially unwanted applica-
tions.
Distinguishing Madware
Adware and its mobile counterpart, mobile Adware (or madware), 
has been around for many years and is a popular way of financing 
free apps, where the app developer is paid a fee for each of the 
adverts presented to their users. Many people are happy relin-
quish a small area of the screen for advertising in exchange for a 
free app; however, this may sometimes happen without consent 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 15
MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
or be particularly aggressive. Symantec recorded a 77 percent 
rise in apps containing unwanted madware.
Ad-blocking tools have grown in popularity as a way to avoid 
this, and by blocking mobile ads, they also help to reduce mobile 
data costs incurred with madware traffic and minimize the 
number of on-screen ads. Furthermore, such software can also 
help to improve the security posture of a device by blocking 
potentially unwanted madware that may be installed without 
the user’s permission or knowledge.
App Analysis by Symantec’s Norton Mobile Insight
    T Symantec analyzed 71 percent more apps in 2015 and more than three 
times as many (230 percent) more were classified as malicious. A 30 
percent rise in grayware was owing in large part to a 77 percent rise in 
apps containing unwanted madware.

Protecting Mobile Devices
We recommend that people and employers treat mobile devices 
like the small, powerful computers that they are and protect 
them accordingly, including:
   T Access control, including biometrics where possible.
   T Data loss prevention, such as on-device encryption.
   T Automated device backup.
   T Remote find and wipe tools, in the event of a lost device.
   T Regular updating. For example, the latest version of 
Android, codenamed Marshmallow (version 6.0), was 
launched in October and includes a number of features 
designed specifically to thwart attackers. According to 
Statista, in October 2015, KitKat (version 4.4) was still the 
most widely used version of Android at 38.9 percent, and 
Lollipop (version 5.0) accounted for 15.6 percent.
   T Refrain from downloading apps from unfamiliar sites and 
only install apps from trusted sources. 
   T Don’t jailbreak devices. Jailbroken devices are often more 
susceptible to security issues.
   T Pay particular attention to permissions requested by an app.
   T Update apps as often as possible, or if a suspicious app is 
identified, delete it and wait for a new version to be made 
available.
   T Change your Apple ID password, or your Google Play 
password, if you suspect your account has been compro-
mised. This advice extends to safeguarding account 
credentials on any third-party app store.
   T Watch out for any suspicious emails or push notifications 
to your device asking for your credentials, or any other 
personally identifying information.
   T Until a patch is applied, proceed cautiously when using your 
mobile browser to preview unsolicited audio and video files.
   T Android users are advised to apply any security updates 
issued by their carrier or device manufacturer as they 
become available.
   T Additional mobile security solutions can also help safeguard 
against malicious software, and enterprises should consider 
mobility management tools that can help secure and 
control mobile devices within an organization.

MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
Looking Ahead
We predict that mobile threats will continue to proliferate in 
2016. We may soon see PC-like exploit kits for phones commer-
cialized on the black market. 
At the same time, Apple and Google are working hard to secure 
their operating systems and wider ecosystems. In particular, 
we anticipate improvements in the techniques used to validate 
and sign applications, as well as in application delivery. Phone 
users will become accustomed to frequent on-by-default appli-
cation and operating system updates, and the need for security 
software on their mobile devices.
This is perhaps an indicator of progress, rather than a cause for 
despair. It suggests that security researchers, operating system, 
developers, and app writers are, in fact, paying more attention 
to mobile security by identifying and fixing more problems. 
Although we expect mobile devices to come under growing 
attack over the next year, there is also hope that with the right 
preventative measures and continuing investment in security, 
users can achieve a high level of protection against them.
THE INTERNET OF THINGS 
Internet-connected things are 
multiplying rapidly. We saw many 
proof-of-concept and real-world 
attacks in 2015, identifying serious 
vulnerabilities in cars, medical 
devices, and more. Manufacturers 
need to prioritize security to 
reduce the risk of serious personal, 
economic, and social consequences.
Billions and Billions of Things
The Internet of Things has already arrived. We only have to look 
around at our own environment to see the impact it is having on our 
everyday lives. The average smart phone now has more computing 
power than the Space Shuttle; a smartwatch now downloads 
updates from the Internet; the point-of-sale terminals at a coffee 
shop are all connected to the company’s central financial system; 
many cars now have satellite navigation and Bluetooth connections; 
an Internet-connected thermostat can control the temperature in 
our homes. 
In the USA, for example, there are 25 online devices per 100 inhab-
itants, and that is just the beginning. Gartner forecasts that 6.4 
billion connected things will be in use worldwide in 2016, and will 
reach 20.8 billion by 2020 (Gartner, Inc., press release, November 
10, 2015).
If the Internet of Things is to deliver the promised $2 trillion 
economic benefit, designers and manufacturers have to address 
fundamental security challenges. The prospects, however, are not 
good.
The Insecurity of Things
Over the last year, Symantec has seen an increase in proof-
of-concept attacks and growing numbers of IoT attacks in the 
wild. In numerous cases, the vulnerabilities were obvious and 
all too easy to exploit. IoT devices often lack stringent security 
measures, and some attacks are able to exploit vulnerabilities in 
the underlying Linux-based operating systems found in several 
IoT devices and routers. Many issues stem from how securely 
vendors implemented mechanisms for authentication and 
encryption (or not). Here are some examples:
    T Cars. Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles after 
researchers demonstrated a proof-of-concept attack where 
they managed to take control of the vehicle remotely. In the 
UK, thieves hacked keyless entry systems to steal cars.
    T Smart home devices. Millions of homes are vulnerable to 
cyberattacks. Symantec research found multiple vulnerabili-
ties in 50 commercially available devices, including a ‘smart’ 
door lock that could be opened remotely online without a 
password. 
    T Medical devices. Researchers have found potentially deadly 
vulnerabilities in dozens of devices such as insulin pumps, 
x-ray systems, CT-scanners, medical refrigerators, and 
implantable defibrillators. 
    T Smart TVs. Hundreds of millions of Internet-connected TVs 
are potentially vulnerable to click fraud, botnets, data theft, 
and even ransomware, according to Symantec research.
    T Embedded devices. Thousands of everyday devices, 
including routers, webcams, and Internet phones, share the 
same hard-coded SSH and HTTPS server certificates, leaving 
more than 4 million devices vulnerable to interception and 
unauthorised access.
We expect to see more stories like this in the coming year. If a 
device can be hacked, it likely will be. In addition, where there 
are proof-of-concept attacks, real attacks invariably follow. We 
may even expect to see IoT devices as the preferred route for 
attacking an organization, and potentially the most difficult for 
incident response staff to recognize and remove.
Given the present poor state of security on connected devices, 
they will present an increasingly attractive target to criminals 
who look for easy targets in the same way that burglars prefer 
houses without alarms or resident dogs.

MOBILE DEVICES & THE INTERNET OF THINGS
Home Automation to Reach  
a Tipping Point by 2020
Despite the increased attention and rapid development, the 
Internet of Things has not reached a critical mass when it comes 
to home automation. Perhaps one of the final hurdles holding 
IoT dominance back has to do with standardized communi-
cation protocols. So far, we have seen plenty of growth with 
interconnected IoT devices using well-established protocols, 
such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth®. Devices that utilize 802.11b/g/n/
ac wireless protocols, including Smart TVs, intelligent thermo-
stats, IP cameras, and other devices, are cropping up everywhere. 
Devices that employ Bluetooth 4.0, such as fitness trackers, 
smart watches, and other wearables, have also helped IoT gain 
significant traction in that market.
However, these communication protocols fall flat in many home 
automation cases. The latest Wi-Fi technologies work great 
for quick and efficient wireless connections, but have power 
requirements that can put a strain on smaller devices. Bluetooth 
does operate better in this scenario, but its short range does 
not make it ideal for communication from more than a few feet 
away. That’s not to say that it cannot be done. It just has not 
been possible to do it cheaply enough to bring the technology 
to ubiquity.
A number of vendors have stepped in to address these communi-
cations challenges, though none has yet to dominate the market. 
This has resulted in a fragmented market of competing wireless 
communication specifications tied to specific vendors or vendor 
groups. What may finally open the gates for small, low powered 
IoT devices is Wi-Fi HaLow™ (IEEE 802.11ah), a new communica-
tions protocol for IoT and wearable devices, slated to be finalized 
and certified between 2016 and 2018. Once released, router 
manufacturers could quickly incorporate the protocol to their 
products, as with other communications protocols like 802.11ac, 
and in so doing, open the doors for consumers to automate their 
homes more easily and cheaply.
Of course, when introducing any new technology, the attack 
surface expands, which presents a variety of new problems from 
a security standpoint. Proprietary IoT networks have already 
been found with multiple security vulnerabilities, some trivial 
and some serious. The fundamental question regarding IoT and 
home automation is not, “How do we do this?” It is, “How do we 
do this securely?”
With the adoption of common standards, it is likely that older 
proprietary protocols will fall by the wayside, paving the way 
for potentially greater consolidation in the marketplace. While 
larger, well-known brand names will continue to release their 
own products, smaller, innovative IoT companies will become 
attractive targets for organizations seeking to quickly expand 
their portfolios into those areas. However, cybersecurity must 
be at the core for the adoption of this new breed of IoT tech-
nology to succeed. As more homes become connected, it will be 
difficult for consumers to ignore the benefits that this new tech-
nology will promise.
It is always important to weigh the convenience of remote 
control, automation, ease of use, and the benefits they can bring, 
against the potential risks introduced that could lead to hackers 
opening IoT locks, disabling IoT burglar alarms, or generally 
wreaking havoc with IoT devices.
How to Protect Connected Devices
Protecting the Internet of things requires the same holistic 
approach as other areas of IT security. Unfortunately, both 
Industrial IoT ecosystems, like the Industrial Internet Consor-
tium (IIC), and consumer IoT ecosystems, such as the AllSeen 
Alliance, are still very early in defining standards for this 
rapidly evolving area. To address this, Symantec published its 
Security Reference Architecture, and contributed to the IIC and 
AllSeen efforts, along with the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) IoT 
Trust Framework, and the US Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) Security Tenets for Life Critical Embedded Systems. 
Effective security requires layers of security built into devices 
and the infrastructure that manages them, including authenti-
cation, code signing, and on-device security (such as Embedded 
Critical System Protection technology). Analytics, auditing, and 
alerting are also key to understanding the nature of threats 
emerging in this area. Finally, strong SSL/TLS encryption tech-
nology plays a crucial role in authentication and data protection.
Towards a Secure, Connected Future
As with other aspects of Internet security, some threats are 
more dangerous than others are, and while a hacked fitness 
monitor may be an inconvenience, a vulnerability in millions of 
cars may present a more serious danger. Similarly, a backdoor 
in a medical device may give thieves access to medical records, 
albeit on a relatively small-scale, or it may lead to serious injury 
or potentially even death. 
The remedies are well-understood, but manufacturers need to 
prioritize security and find the right balance between innovation, 
ease-of-use, and time-to-market constraints. Fundamentally, 
companies and consumers need to be assured that suppliers are 
building security into the IoT devices they are buying.   

WEB ATTACKS, TOOLKITS, AND 
EXPLOITING VULNERABILITIES 
ONLINE
If web servers are vulnerable, then 
so are the websites they host and 
the people who visit them. Attackers 
are exploiting any vulnerability they 
can to compromise websites and 
commandeer their host servers. The 
ease of use and wide availability 
of web attack toolkits is feeding 
the number of web attacks, which 
doubled in 2015.
Website owners still aren’t patching and updating their websites 
and servers as often as perhaps they should. This is like leaving 
a window open through which cybercriminals can climb through 
and take advantage of whatever they find.
Over the past three years, more than three quarters of websites 
scanned contained unpatched vulnerabilities, one in seven (15 
percent) of which were deemed critical in 2015.

Problematic Plugins
It’s not just the operating systems making web servers vulner-
able. While many of the major content management system 
providers have improved security and implemented automatic 
updates in recent years, the security of plugins for these systems 
is still a big problem.

with 12 in 2014 (50 percent), and five in 2013 (22 percent).  With 
such rich pickings, it’s clear to see why attackers are partial to 
exploiting Flash. Apple, Google, and Mozilla have all expressed 
their concerns with the Flash plugin, and Google recently 
announced that Flash will no longer be supported natively in 
Chrome. Mozilla continues to support Flash within Firefox as an 
exception to the general plugin policy. 
From a security perspective, we expect Adobe Flash will 
gradually fall out of common usage over the next year.

WEB THREATS
Exploiting Plugins for Web Servers 
It’s not only plugins for web browsers that are vulnerable and 
exploited. Take WordPress, which now powers a quarter of the 
world’s websites, for example. Anyone can write a WordPress 
plugin―and they often do. Plugins range from the useful to the 
completely ridiculous, such as Logout Roulette: “on every admin 
page load, there’s a 1 in 10 chance you’ll be logged out.” 
The problem is, some plugins are shockingly insecure. Windows 
attracts many exploits because of its large user base, and the 
same applies to WordPress plugins. Vulnerable plugins found on 
WordPress sites can and will be exploited.
Plugins, whether for browsers or servers, need to be updated 
regularly as they are vulnerable to security flaws, and out-of-
date versions should be avoided where possible.
Minimize Risk from Plugins
    T Update plugins regularly.
    T Watch the media and security lists for warnings.
    T Be very selective about the plugins used to reduce your attack 
surface.
 
Infection by Injection
In 2015, Symantec also saw the return of Team GhostShell, 
which claims to have hacked a significant number of websites. 
Earlier this year, the Symantec Security Response team reported: 
“From first appearances, the recently released list of hacked 
websites seems to be random and there is no indication that any 
particular country or sector is being targeted. The group is more 
than likely hacking websites based on their vulnerability.
In keeping with its previous modus operandi, it is likely that 
the group compromised the databases by way of SQL injection 
attacks and poorly configured PHP scripts.”
Again, these are hacks that most likely could have been 
prevented with better website and server management. SQL 
injection is a long-established attack method, which continues 
to work because of an unnecessary weakness in the parameters 
administrators establish for search queries.
Web Attack Exploit Toolkits
It is difficult to defend against new and unknown vulnerabili-
ties, particularly zero-day vulnerabilities for which there may 
be no patch, and attackers are trying hard to exploit them faster 
than vendors can roll out patches.
In 2015, following the breach of Hacking Team, an Italy-based 
company, previously unknown zero-day exploits were made 
public by the attackers. Exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities 
were shared, and within hours, integrated into exploit toolkits. 
Angling for Malicious Ads
The Angler exploit kit, first seen in 2013, is arguably among 
the most sophisticated exploit kits available today, and has 
pioneered many technical advances that other exploit kits have 
often followed, including the use of anti-cybersecurity counter-
measures. For example, Angler is able to download and execute 
malware from memory, without needing to write any files to disk, 
in an attempt to evade detection by traditional security technol-
ogy. Additionally, one significant factor in Angler’s incredible 
growth in 2015 is that it has been very fast at integrating the 
growing number of new zero-day exploits into its arsenal.
Top Five Web Attack Toolkits
    T The Angler exploit kit was the most common exploit kit in use during 2015, 
and accounted for 23 percent of all exploit-kit web attacks. It has grown 
considerably in the last year and was not featured in the top five for 2014.

Angler was the most active exploit kit in 2015, and hundreds 
of thousands of attacks by this kit were blocked by Symantec 
on a daily basis. In total, the number of Angler-based attacks 
blocked numbered over 19.5 million. Angler’s favorite delivery 
mechanism was malvertisments, favoring exploited Adobe Flash 
vulnerabilities. Windows was the preferred target for Angler 
in 2015. Windows 7 in particular accounted for 64 percent of 
Angler attacks, and Windows 8.1 accounted for 24 percent. 
Moreover, Mac OS X did not appear to be in the firing line for 
attackers using the Angler toolkit in 2015, but this is expected 
to change as cybercriminals seek to exploit the Apple ecosystem.
Tech Support Scams Go Nuclear, Spreading 
Ransomware
In 2015, Symantec recorded an increase in tech support scams, 
equivalent to a 200 percent rise compared to the previous year. 
Tech support scams are not a new tactic, and hundreds of 
thousands of people worldwide are targeted on a daily basis. 
The earliest types of tech support scams involved call center 
workers cold-calling users, trying to sell them technical support 
packages to resolve non-existent problems on their intended 
victims’ computers. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 22
WEB THREATS
These scams have evolved over time, and more recent examples 
may display seemingly endless fake warning messages, urging 
the intended victims to call a toll-free number for help. On 
calling the number, seemingly professional-sounding call center 
staff try to convince their intended victims to install malware 
and other unwanted applications onto their computers, while 
claiming it will fix their problems. 
In the latest twist, tech support scammers were found using 
the Nuclear exploit kit to drop ransomware onto its intended 
victims’ computers. The scammers could distract the user while 
the ransomware encrypts files on their computer, perhaps 
increasing their chances of earning money from the victim. 
While this wasn’t the first time tech support scammers have been 
discovered installing ransomware, the most recent examples 
include a malicious HTML iframe on their website, redirecting 
visitors to a server hosting the Nuclear exploit kit. The exploit 
kit was found to be taking advantage of the recent Adobe Flash 
Player Unspecified Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-
2015-7645), among other vulnerabilities. On success, it either 
dropped Trojan.Cryptowall (ransomware) or Trojan.Miuref.B (an 
information-stealing Trojan).
This was the first time Symantec has seen tech support scams 
used in parallel with the Nuclear exploit kit to deliver ransom-
ware, and if this proves to be an effective combination, this 
trend is set to continue. While it may be quite plausible that 
tech support scammers and exploit kit attackers have joined 
forces, it is possible that the tech support scammers’ own web 
servers were compromised by a separate group who are using 
the Nuclear exploit kit.
Blocked Tech Support Scams
    T In total, Symantec blocked more than 100 million malware or exploit-kit 
attacks relating to tech support scams in 2015.
    T The countries targeted the most by tech support scams were the US, UK, 
France, Australia, and Germany.

Malvertising
The middle of 2015 was filled with accounts of malvertising 
affecting almost every segment of the ad-supported Internet. 
One possible explanation is that malvertising is simply an 
easier way to infect site visitors than spamming out links to 
infected websites. It’s much easier for an attacker to try and 
compromise a popular site or seek to host malicious ads on 
popular, high-traffic websites because it means they don’t need 
to consider the complex nuancing of social engineering, elimi-
nating one more step in the bad guys’ “pipeline.”
Ad companies often don’t request a lot of information from 
people submitting ads, making it easy for criminals to masquer-
ade as legitimate businesses and upload malicious ads, which 
can appear on any number of sites. 
Thanks to the use of cookies, malware authors can also tailor 
their malicious code or redirects to target almost any subset of 
users, by geography, time of day, company, interests, or recent 
Internet activity.

WEB THREATS
Unfortunately, malvertising is notoriously difficult to track 
and criminals have become increasingly clever, removing the 
malicious code from their ads after an hour or two, making it 
almost invisible. Since it is powerful, effective, and hard to 
analyze, we expect the use of malvertising to continue to grow. 
Consequently, an increased demand for ad-blockers may in turn 
help to reduce the negative impact of malvertising.
CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  
FOR WEBSITE OWNERS
Whether it’s the way we shop, 
work, or pay our tax bill, trust and 
confidence in online services has 
become critical to our way of life. 
Thankfully, changes are coming to 
the way we use and secure the 
Internet to reinforce trust in online 
privacy, security, and transactions.
Website security encompasses more than the information in 
transit between a server and visitors to a website. Organiza-
tions need to think about their websites as parts of an entire 
ecosystem that needs constant care and attention if they want 
to retain people’s trust and confidence.
The consequences of failing to bolster website security are likely 
to extend beyond the costs to an individual company: it will 
damage consumer confidence and the wider economic fallout 
could be huge.
Put Your Money Where Your Mouse Is
The scales finally tipped during the 2015 Thanksgiving holiday 
weekend in the US, as the number of consumers shopping online 
exceeded those shopping in store, according to the National 
Retail Foundation.
E-commerce is big business, and Ecommerce Europe reported 
that global business-to-consumer ecommerce turnover grew 
by 24 percent, reaching $1.9 billion in 2014. However, that may 
seem small compared to the $6.7 trillion that Frost & Sullivan 
estimates the business-to-business e-commerce market will be 
worth by 2020. Frost & Sullivan’s forecast includes all forms of 
electronic commerce including using Internet and electronic 
data interchange systems.
Even governments are becoming increasingly dependent on 
digital services to keep their books balanced. The British govern-
ment, for example, recently revealed that it had saved £1.7 
billion through digital and technology transformation in 2014.
While SSL/TLS certificates, trust marks, and good website 
security all help maintain the online economy, all this economic 
activity could be at risk if people lose trust and confidence in the 
security foundations of the online economy.
Websites Are Still Vulnerable to Attacks 
Leading to Malware and Data Breaches
Websites are a critical element in major attacks: they are a way 
into the network, they are a way into sensitive data, and they are 
a way to reach customers and partners.
For example, the rise in malware aimed at Linux web servers―
including website hosts―proves that criminals have realized 
that the infrastructure behind websites is as valuable, if not 
more so, than the information encrypted by SSL/TLS certifi-
cates.
Many attacks against website infrastructure could be prevented 
with regular maintenance and patching, but the numbers 
suggest that website owners just aren’t managing to keep up. 
Three quarters of the websites Symantec scanned in 2015 had 
vulnerabilities―a number that hasn’t shifted in years.
Cybercriminals continued to find vulnerabilities in the underly-
ing infrastructure of website security in 2015, including FREAK, 
which allowed attackers intercepting a secure connection to 
force the server to downgrade to encryption an easier-to-crack 
protocol.
Distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have also 
continued to prove disruptive to businesses 2015. While large-
scale attacks such as the one that hit the BBC at the end of 2015 
tend to grab headlines, businesses of every size are a target for 
attack and often smaller sites can suffer as part of the collateral 
damage when a host has to shut down a server, taking multiple 
sites offline, because of an attack on just one of its clients.
Mitigation tactics and tools exist to defend against DDoS attacks, 
but website managers need to take the time to understand and 
deploy them if they are to keep their websites safe.
Moving to Stronger Authentication 
It’s not all bad news. There have been several advances in both 
the strength and adoption of SSL/TLS certificates in 2015 
as well as initiatives by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to make 
issuing SSL/TLS certificates more transparent.
Crucially, nearly 40 percent of all downstream Internet traffic in 
the US is now encrypted, according to research from Sandvine, 
and this is expected to grow to more than 70 percent of the 
world’s Internet traffic over the coming year. 
Unfortunately, in a world where everything is encrypted, 
consumers have a false sense of security that whenever they see 
HTTPS in the browser, the website that they are on has been 
SHARE

WEB THREATS
validated and authenticated and must therefore be genuine. 
In reality, online fraud has historically occurred on Domain 
Validated (DV) sites, which offer no validation of the organiza-
tion behind the site. 
With DV certificates, the CA will verify that a contact at the 
domain in question approves the certificate request, usually via 
email or telephone, and this is often automated. Consequent-
ly, DV certificates are usually cheaper than the more rigorous 
Extended Validation (EV) SSL certificates, which require more 
vetting and validation. 
While DV certificates verify the consent of a domain owner, 
they make no attempt to verify who the domain owner really is, 
making it ideal for both phishing and MITM (man-in-the-mid-
dle) attacks. Symantec expects to see a move by organisations, 
particularly those driven by PCI compliance, to strengthen the 
requirements for stronger authentication, and the adoption of 
EV SSL certificates providing greater levels of assurance.
Encryption of SSL/TLS will also become stronger with the shift 
from SHA-1 to SHA-2. Historically, SHA1 is a very popular 
one-way hashing function, where each hash generated from a 
source is intended to be unique. There should be no “collision” 
where two different sources will generate the same hash; 
however, the first weaknesses were identified as early as 2005. 
This came to a head in 2014 when Google announced it would 
soon no longer support sites using SHA1 and will display 
security warnings to visitors trying to access sites with SHA-1 
certificates expiring after 1st January 2017. Several other 
browser vendors followed suit, spelling the inevitable end for 
SHA-1. 
The security community is making great progress, and there is a 
real opportunity to significantly reduce the number of success-
ful website attacks, but it will only happen if website owners 
step up and take action too.
Accelerating to Always-On Encryption
Nearly 40 percent of all downstream Internet traffic in the US is 
now encrypted, according to research from Sandvine, and this is 
expected to grow to more than 70 percent of the world’s Internet 
traffic over the year. This sudden upsurge is down to a number 
of factors:
    T Big company commitment. Some of the biggest names 
on the Internet have already adopted HTTPS, including 
Facebook, Twitter and, more recently, Netflix.
    T Search engine preference. Google announced in 2014 that 
the adoption of ‘HTTPS everywhere’ would have a positive 
impact on search rankings, encouraging site owners to adopt 
it to get an edge in search engine rankings.
    T HTTP upgrade. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
the organization in charge of creating standards for the 
Internet, published a new version of the Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol in 2015. Dubbed HTTP/2, it will likely be adopted as 
standard in the near future and, as the draft states, HTTP/2 
enables a “more efficient use of network resources,” meaning 
HTTP/2 is designed to deliver better, faster responsive 
performance for websites out of the box. And every major 
browser has said its support for HTTP/2 is only going to be 
over SSL/TLS. In effect, this makes encryption mandatory 
for sites using this new standard.
The hope is that within the next few years, every page on the 
Internet will have an SSL/TLS certificate. Symantec is already 
working with web hosting providers to help them provide 
encryption as part of their service to website owners.
Reinforced Reassurance
Several major browsers are also changing their security indi-
cators―the colours and symbols used in the address bar to 
indicate to visitors how safe a site is―to make it clear when an 
SSL/TLS-secured web page includes unsecured content that is 
vulnerable to man-in-the-middle tampering. In other words, 
this will make it clearer when a site fails to achieve always-on 
encryption and the danger this poses.
This is just one example of the drive to offer added reassurance 
to websites visitors and online shoppers, which also includes 
trust marks and shopping guarantees, which help to allay the 
fears many shoppers have when they shop online and can’t see 
the store owner in person or hold the goods they’re buying in 
their hands.

WEB THREATS
Websites Need to Become Harder to Attack 
Organizations need to be more proactive around SSL/TLS imple-
mentation. It’s not a one-and-done task. Tools that automate 
and streamline the process are essential.
Updates are released regularly for SSL/TLS protocol libraries, 
such as OpenSSL, to protect against such vulnerabilities, but 
website owners still have to install them. The move from SHA-1 
certificates to the much stronger SHA-2 is also accelerating, but 
again organizations have to deploy the new certificates properly 
for the change to be effective. 
Rather than thinking solely about protection, website managers 
need to think about protection, detection, and response. They 
need to use automation tools to monitor their websites continu-
ally for signs of vulnerability or attack, block those attacks, and 
then report, update, and patch accordingly.
SSL/TLS AND THE  
INDUSTRY’S RESPONSE
SSL/TLS remains at the heart of 
online privacy, authentication, and 
encryption, but around them is an 
infrastructure of trust that requires 
maintenance and vigilance if it is to 
remain effective. The industry must 
learn and adapt.
The Evolution of Encryption
On August 11, 1994, Daniel Kohn sold a CD to a friend in Phil-
adelphia. His friend used his credit card to spend $12.48, plus 
shipping costs, in a transaction that, for the first time ever, 
was protected by encryption technology. The site Daniel ran at 
the time required customers to download a special browser to 
conduct secure transactions, which employed the PGP encryp-
tion standard that his website relied on.
Reporting the next day, the New York Times commented:
“Alarmed by increasing reports of security breaches on the 
Internet, many people and businesses are reluctant to transmit 
sensitive information, including credit cards numbers, sales 
information, or private electronic mail messages, on the 
network.”
Twenty years later, people’s concerns remain the same, although 
their behaviour suggests they’re willing to take the risk of 
relying on their bank for help if something goes wrong. Without 
a consistent and secure SSL/TLS infrastructure, however, this 
fragile state of trust will crumble and ecommerce simply won’t 
be able to function.
Strength in Numbers
The strength of SSL/TLS has come a long way since 1994, and 
this year saw the switch from SHA-1 to SHA-2 as the industry 
standard moving forward. 
As computing power has increased, so has a hacker’s ability 
to break hashing algorithms through sheer brute force. Many 
experts predict that SHA-1 will become vulnerable in the very 
near future. That’s why the major browsers have agreed to stop 
supporting SHA-1 certificates during the next two years so that 
any visitors trying to access a site continuing to use them will 
see a security warning.
“The current plan is to [stop accepting SHA-1 certificates] on 
January 1, 2017.  However, in light of recent attacks on SHA-1, 
we are also considering the feasibility of having a cut-off date as 
early as July 1, 2016,” says Mozilla, and there has been discus-
sion of bringing those dates even further forward to accelerate 
the change.
Symantec offers a free upgrade service, but large organizations 
need to ensure they have a full migration plan in place to update 
any devices and applications that may not currently recognize 
SHA-2.
Time to freak out?
    T The vulnerability known as FREAK was discovered back in 
March 2015. Attackers who intercepted the setting up of a secure 
connection between an affected server and client could force them 
to use ‘export-grade’ encryption, a much weaker form of encryption 
than is usually used today, therefore making the transacted 
message easy to break with the computing resources available 
today. 
    T It’s estimated that servers supporting 9.6 percent of the top one 
million website domains were initially vulnerable to attack and nine 
months later, 8.5 percent remain so.
Slipping through the Cracks
Despite encryption getting stronger, many of the attacks aimed 
at SSL/TLS this year have focused on weaknesses in the wider 
SSL/TLS ecosystem. 
Symantec has seen a much greater focus in the last year on the 
code libraries related to SSL/TLS implementations, and as a 
result, we have seen a regular stream of vulnerability updates 
and fixes. 
That’s the good news. But the most common unpatched vulner-
abilities on web servers in the last year reveal that website 
owners aren’t keeping up with the releases. It’s vital that website 
managers maintain the integrity of their SSL/TLS implementa-
tions. It’s not a fit-and-forget task.

dangerous as 2014’s Heartbleed, OpenSSL released several 
updates and patches throughout 2015. OpenSSL is one of the 
most widely-used implementations of the SSL and TLS cryp-
tographic protocols and is used on two-thirds of all web servers.
The updates it released were for vulnerabilities that ranged 
from low risk to high severity and which could allow attackers 
to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks to eavesdrop on secure 
communications or to launch denial-of-service attacks.
Checks and Balances
In order to strengthen the SSL/TLS ecosystem, Symantec 
has pushed for the widespread adoption of DNS Certification 
Authority Authorization (CAA). This allows an organization, or 
DNS owner, to specify which certificate authority (CA) it will buy 
SSL/TLS certificates from. If a malicious actor, or an employee 
who doesn’t know company policy, tries to purchase a certificate 
from a CA not on the approved list, that CA can check the CAA 
and alert the DNS owner of the request. 
This reduces the risk of rogue certificates being issued in a legit-
imate organization’s name without its knowledge, which in turn 
would reduce the risk of criminals being able to set up certified 
phishing sites.
In an effort to better spot rogue certificates, Symantec is also 
complying with Google’s request to log all EV certificates we 
issue on its Certificate Transparency log. As of March 2016, 
Symantec is also logging OV and DV certificates. Along with 
software that can monitor and audit certificates and their use, 
this creates, as its authors say, “an open framework that lets 
anyone observe and verify newly issued and existing SSL certif-
icates in nearly real time."
Trust Services, Electronic Identification (eID), 
and Electronic Trust Services (eTS)
In September 2015, the European Commission completed the 
adoption of all the implementing acts required for adoption 
of the new  eIDAS Regulation. This regulation marks a major 
change in the regulatory environment to enable secure and 
seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens, 
and public authorities across Europe.
Moreover, it is also an important step forward in promoting 
greater security requirements for Certificate Authorities (CAs) 
with the implementation of an EU Trust Mark for Qualified 
Trust Services. The new trust mark will help in clearly differ-
entiating qualified trust services from others in the market, 
fostering greater transparency and confidence in such essential 
online services.   

SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND 
EXPLOITING THE INDIVIDUAL
The sophistication and ruthlessness 
of some of the attacks and tactics 
used by cybercriminals in 2015 
have demonstrated how vulnerable 
individuals are online and chipped 
away at public confidence in online 
security. Data breaches, government 
surveillance, and good old-fashioned 
scams came together to further 
encroach on personal privacy, 
whether it is personal photos, login 
credential or medical histories. 
Personal data is anything but private.
Trust No One 
In 2015, Symantec saw plenty of traditional scams and 
malware attacks intended to gather personal information. For 
example, one scam promised large numbers of followers for 
free on Instagram, while seeking to fool people into revealing 
their passwords. Some attacks impersonated tax officials in 
an attempt to trick people into downloading malicious email 
attachments.
In their simplest form, many scams still rely on the poor security 
habits of the general public to succeed. However, we have also 
seen how poor website security can expose customer data. In the 
latter example, it doesn’t matter how strong a password may be 
if the website is vulnerable to a data breach.
More concerning are attacks in 2015 that made use of sophisti-
cated social engineering to bypass the two-factor authentication 
systems designed to safeguard users.
By going through a legitimate password-reset process and 
posing as Google via SMS, however, one scam was able exploit 
the public’s trust in a reputable brand to gain access to email 
accounts without raising the victims’ suspicions.

SOCIAL MEDIA & SCAMS
Secrets and Lies
While traditional scams continued, 2015 also saw more salacious 
scams and threats to privacy.
Online ‘sextortion’ has been around for years, and more 
recent examples, particularly prevalent in Asia, have turned 
to malicious Android apps. These scammers, using an attrac-
tive avatar or profile picture, encourage the intended victim to 
share sexually-explicit videos. The criminals then encourage 
the victim to “continue the liaison” using an Android app, which 
also gathers the victim’s phone number, account details, and all 
of their contacts. 
Now with an incriminating video, and a list of the victim’s 
friends and family, the gang threatens to send the sexually 
explicit content to the victim’s entire contact list unless they 
pay up. Because of the sensitive nature of the threat, victims 
often find it difficult to go to the authorities and end up sending 
hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to the attacker.
In the wake of the Ashley Madison attack, a spike in spam 
messages with subject lines like “How to Check if You Were 
Exposed in Ashley Madison Hack” or “Ashley Madison hacked, 
is your spouse cheating?” were reported. The hack was perhaps 
more unusual in that its ramifications went well beyond the 
financial sphere to affect people’s personal relationships and 
reputations.
Social Engineering  
Using Social Media
Social media remains a favored target 
of scammers, as criminals seek to 
leverage the trust people have in their 
own social circles to spread scams, 
fake links, and phishing. To succeed, 
the social engineering involved must 
be convincing, and so we see more 
progressive and ingenious tactics to 
dupe potential victims.
One scam in particular went to great 
lengths to create an entire family 
tree of hundreds of thousands of fake 
Twitter accounts, each branch boosting 
the credibility of the one above, to gain 
followers, and retweets from genuine 
Twitter users. At the top of the family 
tree were accounts impersonating news 
outlets and celebrities, even curating 
real tweets from the genuine accounts 
to make them seem more credible. 
Through the discovery of these 
imposter accounts, we identified three 
account types that were being used:
   T ‘Mockingbird’ accounts: use brand and celebrity imagery for 
impersonation
   T ‘Parrot’ accounts: fake accounts using stolen tweets and 
photographs of real women
   T ‘Egg’ accounts: act like new users with no tweets and use the 
default “egg” avatar
Each tweet from a Mockingbird account received nearly 1,000 
retweets and 500 favorites, which were not genuine, as they orig-
inated from a secondary account, which we called the Parrot. In 
turn, Parrot accounts, follow anyone and everyone in the hope 
that genuine Twitter users will follow them back, a remarkably 
effective tactic. 
If these Parrot accounts only retweeted spam from the Mock-
ingbird accounts, they would quickly be spotted, which is why 
they also posted other tweets too, typically copying tweets and 
retweeting memes from genuine Twitter users.
On the other hand, the majority of Egg accounts never composed 
a single tweet. Instead, they would simply be used to bolster the 
number of followers of the Parrot accounts in the hundreds. 
This complex operation centered on weight-loss spam. The 
operators went to great lengths to avoid anti-spam measures 
and were able to operate for a long time.

SOCIAL MEDIA & SCAMS
Social networking scams require some form of interaction, 
and manual sharing remained the main route for social media 
attacks in 2015, expanding on the technique that had snow-
balled in the previous year.

    T Manual Sharing – These rely on victims to actually do the work of 
sharing the scam by presenting them with intriguing videos, fake 
offers, or messages that they share with their friends.
    T Fake Offering – These scams invite social network users to join a 
fake event or group with incentives, such as free gift cards. Joining 
often requires the user to share credentials with the attacker or send 
a text to a premium rate number.
    T Likejacking – Using fake “Like” buttons, attackers trick users into 
clicking website buttons that install malware and may post updates 
on a user’s newsfeed, spreading the attack.
    T Fake Apps – Users are invited to subscribe to an application that 
appears to be integrated for use with a social network, but is not as 
described, and may be used to steal credentials or harvest other 
personal data.
    T Fake Plugin – Users are invited to install a plugin to view a video, but 
the plugin is malicious and may spread by re-posting the fake video 
message to a victim’s profile page without permission. Examples 
include installing a fake YouTube premium browser extension to 
view the video, or noticing that a DivX plugin is required, and the fake 
plugin masquerades as such. For more information visit:

vehicle-scammers
Language and Location Is No Barrier
Other forms of attack seen in 2015 also prove just how sophis-
ticated and ruthless criminals are willing to be to make a profit. 
Wherever you live or whatever language you speak, you could 
still be under threat from cyber attackers. Take Boleto, a payment 
system used in Brazil for example. Boleto may be considered a 
niche, very local system, and yet in 2015, three malware families 
emerged specifically targeting it. 
Similar localized attacks around the world show that cyber-
criminals are putting in the effort to manipulate victims no 
matter the location or the language. Adapting phishing scams 
using phishing toolkits makes it extremely easy to conduct a 
campaign against a target in one country, change the templates, 
and quickly target another elsewhere. Often the language used 
in such localized attacks has been automatically translated 
through the templates and may appear convincing to a non-na-
tive speaker.
Number of Phishing URLs on Social Media
    T The chart shows how social media has played a crucial role in the social 
engineering of attacks in the past. In recent years, these sites have 
clamped-down on such abuses, and made it much harder for the attackers 
to exploit them.

Safeguarding Against Social Engineering
Cybercrime costs the global economy up to US$575 billion 
annually according to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, 
whose report goes on to say that in a potential worst-case 2020 
‘Cybergeddon’ scenario, cybercrime could extract up to a fifth of 
the value created by the Internet. 
It is everyone’s responsibility to do all they can to prevent that 
from happening.
For consumers, it’s time kick bad habits. Many people know 
the basics of good cybersecurity, yet people continue to share 
their passwords. In fact more than a third of people who share 
passwords in the United States have shared the password to 
their online banking account. People need to start taking more 
responsibility for shoring up their online security. 
Users should more wary of who they follow on social media. Bots 
can appear more and more like a real person, and are sometimes 
difficult to spot. When choosing who to trust on social media, 
consider the following advice:
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 31
SOCIAL MEDIA & SCAMS
    T Be skeptical of new followers. If a random person follows 
you, do not automatically follow them back. Look at their 
tweets. Are they retweeting content that looks like spam? If 
they are, they are most likely a bot.
    T Numbers can lie. Even if these random followers have tens 
of thousands of followers, those numbers can easily be faked. 
Do not base your decision to follow them back based on how 
many people follow them.
    T Look for the “verified” badge. Twitter users should always 
check to see if a well-known brand or famous celebrity has 
been verified by Twitter before following. The blue verified 
badge denotes that Twitter has authenticated the true owner 
of an account.
Taking risks with cybersecurity is not acceptable, and we should 
reject the misconception that privacy no longer exists. Privacy is 
something precious, and should be protected carefully.
For businesses, this means approaching security in terms of 
education, cybersecurity awareness training, and good digital 
hygiene. Every employee should be part of the effort to stay 
digitally healthy. CIOs and IT managers need to be aware of 
just how many risks they face and start proactively monitoring 
for symptoms so that they can diagnose digital diseases before 
putting customer data and customer confidence at risk.
EMAIL AND COMMUNICATIONS 
THREATS
IT systems continue to come 
under attack from rapidly evolving 
malware. Email remains the medium 
of choice for cybercriminals and 
email volumes continue to grow, as 
phishing and spam decline—the latter 
of which accounted for more than 
half of inbound email traffic. Phishing 
attacks were more targeted and 
malicious emails grew in number 
and complexity, highlighting how 
email remains an effective medium 
for cybercriminals.
Email Abuse 
Email continues to dominate digital communications, regard-
less of the rising popularity of instant messaging technology 
for both business and consumer use. Symantec estimates there 
were approximately 190 billion emails in circulation each day in 
2015, a number that we predict to grow by as much as 4 percent 
by the end of 2016. On average, each business user sent and 
received 42 emails each day, and a growing number of individ-
uals were reading email on mobile devices. For cybercriminals 
who want to reach the largest number of people electronically, 
email is still the favored way to do it.
No wonder it is still widely used by Internet criminals for spam, 
phishing, and email malware. In 2015, Symantec saw email 
threats decline. Email-based attacks from phishing and malware 
are categorized as spam, and accounted for approximately one 
percent of all spam email. Symantec provides further analysis of 
spam classified as malware and phishing, as these threats have 
potentially significant, harmful consequences. 
Symantec scans a significant proportion of the global business 
email traffic, giving us a unique insight into this medium and 
the security threats it poses. Many business emails will never 
be sent outside of an organization, with approximately three 
quarters of external business email traffic being inbound, more 
than half of which was spam.  
Spam Trends
More than half of inbound business email traffic was spam in 
2015, despite a gradual decline over recent years. In 2015, spam 
reached its lowest level since 2003. However, the spam problem 
is not going away. Spammers are finding other ways to reach 
their audiences, including the use of social networking and 
instant messaging, two of the most popular types of applica-
tions found on mobile devices. In exploiting them in addition to 
email, spammers continually seek to evolve their tactics.
In addition, Symantec has observed an increase in what 
is commonly known as “snowshoe spam.” As an analogy, 
snowshoes are designed to spread the wearer’s weight across a 
wide area, and snowshoe spamming distributes large volumes of 
spam across a wide range of IP addresses. As the name implies, 
this technique seeks to circumvent anti-spam technology, such 
as propagation latency and IP address reputation, by sending 
large volumes of spam messages in very short bursts. By also 
quickly rotating domains and recirculating IP addresses, this 
can make them more difficult to block quickly.

Phishing Trends
Over the years, phishing campaigns have become much easier 
to operate, thanks to the evolving cybercriminal marketplace. 
Attackers will cooperate, with some specializing in phishing 
kits, and others selling them on to other scammers who want to 
conduct phishing campaigns. 
These kits often trade for between US$2 and $10, and their users 
do not require much in the way of technical skills to operate them 
or customize their webpages to suit their needs. Scammers may 
use the data stolen from these attacks for their own purposes, or 
sell it on underground marketplaces for a profit.
Symantec has reported a concerning increase in the number and 
sophistication of phishing attempts, targeting specific depart-
ments within organizations. While some phishing attempts may 
seem obvious, such as a fake delivery tracking emails, the Legal 
and Finance departments at some company were targeted with 
well-crafted phishing attacks. 
Some of these included wire transfer attempts, and while it may 
seem surprising, some companies have lost millions of dollars 
because employees were fooled into believing wire transfer 
requests and other phishing attacks were genuine. The social 
engineering involved in these phishing attacks is more sophis-
ticated and targeted. They not only send generic scams to large 
numbers of people, but seek to develop ongoing relationships, 
validate access to company information, and build trust. 
Social engineering requires research and reconnaissance, 
reviewing social media profiles, and the online activity of 
potential targets to learn about their job, their co-workers, and 
the organizational structure. With this information so easily 
obtained online, phishing emails are more personalized, and 
convincing―displaying an understanding of the business and 
knowledge of key executives and work processes.
Many businesses are a prime target, and an assumption that 
technology can provide automatic protection is a false one. While 
leveraging sophisticated controls and technology for protection, 
organizations still rely on the capability of its employees to 
detect advanced and targeted phishing campaigns.
One successful attempt can do serious harm to a company’s 
reputation and credibility.

Email Malware Trends
As with phishing fraud, malware distributed in emails requires 
social engineering to convince its recipient to open the attach-
ment or to click on a link. Attachments can be disguised as fake 
invoices, office documents, or other files, and often exploits an 
unpatched vulnerability in the software application used to open 
that type of file. Malicious links may direct the user to a compro-
mised website using a web attack toolkit to drop something 
malicious onto their computer. 
Threats like Dridex exclusively use spam email campaigns, and 
incorporate real company names in the sender address and in 
the email body. The vast majority of Dridex spam masquerades 
as financial emails, such as invoices, receipts, and orders. The 
emails include malicious Word or Excel attachments with a 
payload that drops the actual malware designed to target online 
banking information.
The cybercriminal group behind this particular attack has used 
many different techniques for sending spam and malware: from 
simple malware attachments, hyperlinks in the message body 
that point to an exploit kit landing page, malicious PDF attach-
ments, and document macros.
Email malware has not been in decline in the same way as 
general spam, and because of its relatively low volume in 
comparison, it is more subject to fluctuation. Spikes occur when 
large campaigns are undertaken.

Communications Attacks
We saw a succession of attacks and vulnerabilities in the under-
lying encryption used to secure email transmissions. For 
example, the Logjam attack exploits a weakness in the key 
exchange mechanism that begins any encrypted exchange.
    T Customers can check their domains for Logjam, and other major 
vulnerabilities, using Symantec’s SSL Toolbox. 
    T Use this free tool to check for major issues, such as POODLE 
or Heartbleed, as well as potential errors in your SSL/TLS 
certificate(s) installation.
Email Encryption
Email encryption is valuable because it protects the privacy 
of messages and can help to authenticate senders. It is under 
threat because of vulnerabilities in the underlying technology 
(see above) but also because it is not widely used. 
Although webmail systems such as Microsoft’s Outlook.com 
and Google Mail use encryption on the clients, and almost all 
email systems prioritize encrypted transmission, a surpris-
ing proportion of email is sent in the clear using unencrypted 
SMTP transfers. Google reports that in 2015, around 57 percent 
of inbound emails were encrypted compared with 51 percent 
the year before. The number of outbound encrypted emails 
rose from 65 percent to 80 percent in the same period. It isn’t 
unusual for some spam to be sent using encryption. As long ago 
as 2010, the Rustock botnet used TLS encryption as a means to 
disguise the spam it was sending. 
Good desktop and gateway email encryption tools do exist, 
including Symantec’s own, but companies need to make better 
use of the technology available to them to protect email in 
transit and at rest.

Email Security Advice
Organizations and individuals need to realize that even if they 
do not think they are an obvious target for cybercriminals, it 
does not mean they are immune. 
On a personal level, this means remaining vigilant by:
   T Not opening emails from unknown senders
   T Looking for the padlock and checking the encryption certifi-
cate on any sites where you enter sensitive data
   T Not using unsecure networks when accessing sensitive data
For organizations to remain vigilant by:
   T Deploying email encryption where possible
   T Ensuring that email is scanned for malware, spam, and 
phishing
   T Using web security systems to block access to known 
phishing sites
Looking Ahead
With a continual three-year decline, we expect phishing attacks 
to remain at least at current levels, if not decline further. 
Phishing attacks have become more targeted, and less scatter-
gun. Many attacks have shifted towards social media, adding to 
the decline in email numbers. Some parts of the world suffer 
more from email phishing attacks than others―with the greatest 
decline in many English-speaking countries, North America and 
parts of Western Europe.
People will continue to do more and more online, and because 
Internet access and online transactions are growing in popu-
larity among developing countries, we may even see growth 
in phishing attacks in these areas. For example, paying utility 
bills, booking doctors’ appointments, applying to a university, 
managing frequent flyer accounts, and taking out insurance all 
provide fruitful inspiration for phishing attacks. 
As organizations deliver more services online they need to be 
mindful of the need for security, and they have to work with 
customers to educate them further and build trust. In addition, 
they may need to consider two-factor authentication to ensure 
customer confidence and reduce the cost of phishing fraud.
As we have noted, cybercriminals are increasingly moving 
towards more complex email threats, where malware authors, 
ransomware creators, phishers, and scammers will seek to 
exploit what they perceive to be the weakest link in the chain―
humans. Social engineering, or “head hacking,” is a vital 
ingredient to any would-be attacker that is trying to gain access 
to systems that hold potentially valuable information.   

TARGETED ATTACKS
TARGETED ATTACKS,  
SPEAR PHISHING, AND 
INTELLECTUAL  
PROPERTY THEFT
Widespread, persistent, and 
sophisticated attacks against 
government organizations and 
businesses of all sizes pose greater 
risks to national security and the 
economy. The number of zero-day 
vulnerabilities grew, and evidence 
of them being weaponized for 
use in cyberattacks was revealed. 
Spear-phishing campaigns became 
stealthier, targeting fewer individuals 
within a smaller number of select 
organizations.
Persistent Attacks
In February 2015, 78 million patient records were exposed in 
a major data breach at Anthem, the second largest healthcare 
provider in the US. Symantec traced the attack to a well-fund-
ed attack group, named Black Vine, that has associations with 
a China-based IT security organization, called Topsec. Black 
Vine is responsible for carrying out cyberespionage campaigns 
against multiple industries, including energy and aerospace, 
using advanced, custom-developed malware.
Other high-profile targets of cyberespionage in 2015 included 
the White House, the Pentagon, the German Bundestag, and the 
US Government’s Office of Personnel Management, which lost 
21.5 million personnel files, including sensitive information 
such as health and financial history, arrest records, and even 
fingerprint data.
These attacks are part of a rising tide of sophisticated, well-re-
sourced, and persistent cyberespionage attacks around the 
world. Targets include state secrets, intellectual property such 
as designs, patents, and plans, and as evidenced by recent data 
breaches, personal information. 
Symantec’s continuing investigation into the Regin Trojan 
gives us a further glimpse into the technical capabilities of 
state-sponsored attackers. It revealed 49 new modules, each 
of which adds new capabilities, such keylogging, email and file

access, and an extensive command-and-control infrastructure. 
Symantec analysts commented that the level of sophistication 
and complexity of Regin suggests that the development of this 
threat could have taken well-resourced teams of developers 
many months or years to develop.
Currently, spear-phishing and watering-hole attacks that 
exploit compromised websites are the favored avenues for 
targeted attacks. However, as additional layers of technology 
are introduced to an organization, its attack surface expands. 
With businesses turning more to cloud technology and the prev-
alence of IoT devices, we expect to see targeted attacks seeking 
to exploit vulnerabilities in these systems within the next year 
or two. Cloud services particularly vulnerable to exploits, such 
as SQL injection flaws, will likely be targeted first. Spear-phish-
ing campaigns exploiting misconfiguration and poor security by 
users, rather than cloud service providers, will bear low-hanging 
fruit for the attackers.
In order to remain below the radar, spear-phishing campaigns 
have increased in number, but have become smaller with fewer 
individuals targeted in each campaign. We expect spear-phish-
ing campaigns will soon consist of just a single target, or a few 
select individuals at the same organization. Moreover, the larger 
spear-phishing campaigns will likely all be conducted using 
web-based watering hole attacks, with compromised websites 
exploiting highly-coveted zero-day vulnerabilities.
Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Watering Holes
Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly valuable to attackers. 
Indeed, because zero-day vulnerabilities are such a seemingly 
rare commodity, attackers will closely guard their exploits so 
that they may be used for longer and remain undetected. 
Sophisticated watering-hole attacks, using compromised 
websites, activate only when a visitor to that website originates 
from a particular IP address. Reducing collateral damage in this 
way makes it less likely that the covert attack is discovered. 
Moreover, this approach also makes it more difficult for security 
researchers who may visit the website from a different location. 
Once an exploit is disclosed publically by the relevant vendor, 
these watering-hole sites will often switch to using another 
unpublished exploit for a different zero-day vulnerability in 
order to remain hidden. 
The breach of Hacking Team in 2015 stood out because the 
attackers weren’t after money or identities; they were after 
cyberweapons, such as zero-day exploits. Hacking Team is 
an Italian outfit that specializes in covert surveillance and 
espionage software marketed at government users. Previously 
unknown zero-day exploits were uncovered in the attack and 
made public by the attackers. Details of weaponized zero-day 
vulnerabilities and numerous Trojans used by the group were 
shared within days on public forums, and within hours, exploit 
kit authors had integrated them into their exploit toolkits.
Diversity in Zero Days
There was an unprecedented 54 zero-day vulnerabilities found 
throughout 2015, more than doubling the number found in the 
previous year. Discovering unknown vulnerabilities and figuring 
out how to exploit them has clearly become a go-to technique for 
advanced attackers, and there is no sign of this trend changing.
Zero-Day Vulnerabilities
    T Zero-day vulnerabilities command high prices on the black market. 
Because of this, and because of their very nature we believe that the 
number of zero-day vulnerabilities yet to be discovered is much higher.
2013 Change 2014 Change 2015
23 +4% 24 +125% 54
Most of the zero days seen in 2015 target old, “faithful” tech-
nologies that have been targeted for years. Attackers racked up 
10 individual zero-day vulnerabilities against Adobe’s Flash 
Player during the year. Microsoft received equal attention from 
malicious zero-day developers, though the 10 zero day vulner-
abilities found targeting their software was distributed across 
Microsoft Windows (6x), Internet Explorer (2x), and Microsoft 
Office (2x). The Android operating system was also targeted 
through four zero-day vulnerabilities during 2015.
Zero-Day Vulnerabilities, Annual Total
    T The highest number of zero-day vulnerabilities was disclosed in 2015, 
evidence of the maturing market for research in this area.

TARGETED ATTACKS
What is concerning, though not surprising, is that there were 
11 zero-day vulnerabilities that were used to exploit open 
source software. Some exploits targeted common libraries and 
packages, while others went after open source web develop-
ment tools, like content management systems and e-commerce 
platforms. Networking protocols were also highly targeted, with 
continued attacks against OpenSSL, as well as Samba.
However, what should give most people cause for concern is 
that attackers appear to be discovering and exploiting zero-day 
vulnerabilities in industrial control systems (ICSs)—devices 
used to control things ranging from industrial manufacturing to 
power plants. There were seven known zero-day vulnerabilities 
during 2015 targeting a variety of different manufacturers and 
different devices.

The motivations behind such attacks are not clear, and could 
range from geopolitical disputes to ransom-related attacks. 
Regardless, if not monitored carefully, such attacks could have 
serious consequences in the future, and it doesn’t look likely to 
go away anytime soon.

In the case of CVE-2015-5119, Symantec already had signatures 
that were able to detect exploits four days before the vulnerabil-
ity was publically disclosed. Sometimes, existing signatures can 
be successful in blocking attacks exploiting new vulnerabilities, 
and signatures are frequently updated to block more attacks 
even where protection exists beforehand. Additionally, this 
vulnerability was among those exposed in the breach against 
Hacking Team.
Spear Phishing
It’s not only websites that may contain hidden exploits. A previ-
ously-unknown vulnerability may be exploited to attack an 
organization using an infected document attached in an email. 
Such an attack is known as spear phishing, and relies heavily on 
very good social engineering in order to dress-up the email to 
appear convincing. 
Spear-phishing emails are sent in waves, or campaigns, to a 
very small group of people, often not all at once, but individu-
ally or where more than one person in an organization may be 
targeted. Over time, different exploits may be used against the 
same people, should these attacks prove ineffective. However, in 
recent years attackers quickly switch tactics after a few failed 
attempts in order to remain undetected. In previous years, 
they were more likely to continue with different exploits or by 
targeting different individuals within the organization.

Spear-Phishing Email Campaigns
    T In 2015, the number of campaigns increased, while the number of attacks 
and the number of recipients within each campaign continued to fall. With 
the length of time shortening, it’s clear that these types of attacks are 
becoming stealthier.

Spear-phishing attacks are less likely to arouse suspicion with 
campaigns that are smaller, shorter, and target fewer recipi-
ents. A few years ago, a targeted attack campaign may have been 
directed to a hundred or more individuals, any one of whom may 
become suspicious and raise the alarm. With fewer people, this 
probability is greatly reduced.
In 2015, the Finance sector was the most targeted, with 34.9 
percent of all spear-phishing email directed at an organization 
in that industry, 15 percentage points higher than the previous 
year. The likelihood of an organization in this sector being 
targeted at least once in the year was 8.7 percent (approximate-
ly 1 in 11). With so many attacks destined for this sector, some 
businesses were being targeted more aggressively than others. 
Typically, such an organization may expect to be targeted at least 
four times during the year. The attackers only have to succeed 
once, whereas the businesses must thwart each and every attack 
to remain secure. Businesses should already be thinking about 
what to do when (not if) such a breach occurs.
Top Industries Targeted in Spear-Phishing Attacks
    T In 2015, we combined the Services groups (previously, “Services, 
Professional” and “Services, Non-Traditional”) into one group. We have also 
identified some of the most frequently targeted sub-sectors, including the 
Energy sector, which includes some mining industries, and Healthcare, 
which is part of the Services category.
    T *The Risk in Group figure is a measure of the likelihood of an organization 
in that industry being attacked at least once during the year. For example, 
if there are 100 customers in a group and 10 of them were targeted, that 
would indicate a risk of 10 percent.

TARGETED ATTACKS
   T Advanced Threat Group 8 (ATG9, a.k.a. Emissary Panda) 
– Attacks against financial, aerospace, intelligence, telecom-
munications, energy, and nuclear engineering industries 
in search of intellectual property; notable for exploiting 
CVE-2015-5119, a zero-day exploit revealed in the Hacking 
Team breach
   T Waterbug and Turla – Russia-based espionage spear-phish-

Profiting from High-Level Corporate Attacks 
and the Butterfly Effect
Butterfly is a group of extremely well-organized, highly-capable 
hackers who are spying on companies with a view to profiting on 
the stock market by selling market-sensitive information to the 
highest-bidder. The types of information the attackers poten-
tially had access to included emails, legal documents, policy 
documents, training materials, product descriptions, and data 
harvested from specialist security systems. Stolen materials 
such as these could also be valuable for insider-trading purposes.
Symantec first saw these attacks in 2012 and 2013 when they 
compromised some well-known companies including Apple, 
Microsoft, and Facebook. However, they also employ sophisticat-
ed counter-measures to cover their tracks, including encrypted 
virtual command and control servers.

Cybersecurity, Cybersabotage, and Coping 
with Black Swan Events
A Black Swan event is an event that was unprecedented and 
unexpected at the time it occurred; however, after further 
analysis, experts sometimes conclude that it could have been 
predicted. The term originates from the belief that all swans were 
white, until in 1697, black swans were discovered in Australia. 
If advanced cyberespionage is so common, it is perhaps curious 
that cybersabotage is not. The capabilities required to inflict 
physical damage are similar to those needed for cyberespionage, 
and the target set is growing thanks to the proliferation of Inter-
net-connected devices, including industrial control systems.
The British Government’s 2015 security and defense review 
sums up the challenges neatly:
“The range of cyber actors threatening the UK has 
grown. The threat is increasingly asymmetric and global. 
Reliable, consistent cyber defense typically requires 
advanced skills and substantial investment. But growing 
numbers of states, with state-level resources, are devel-
oping advanced capabilities which are potentially 
deployable in conflicts, including against CNI [Critical 
National Infrastructure], and government institutions. 
And non-state actors, including terrorists and cyber 
criminals can use easily available cyber tools and tech-
nology for destructive purposes.”
The Stuxnet cyberattack on the Iranian nuclear program is the 
best-known example of an Internet attack on physical infra-
structure. It may be that other successful attacks have occurred 
in the shadows or that infections are in place, but haven’t been 
activated yet. It seems unlikely that the world’s critical infra-
structure is immune. An attack at the end of 2014 on a German 
steel mill is a warning of potentially more serious attacks to 
come. 
Speculations about possible cybersabotage continued into 2015 
with the discovery of an information-stealing threat named 
Trojan.Laziok. This particular threat appears to have been 
designed for reconnaissance style attacks aimed at the energy 
sector, particularly in the Middle East. Laziok wasn’t implicitly 
designed to attack and bring down critical infrastructure, but 
rather to gather information about the systems it compromised. 
As we discussed in ISTR 20, these attacks can be just as potent as 
direct attacks against critical systems, improving an attacker’s 
ability to press further into an environment simply by learning 
more about the types of systems they are traversing. Simply 
put, if an attacker knows what types of computers he or she has 
or can compromise, they can decide how to proceed in order to 
carry out their malicious goals.

TARGETED ATTACKS
Cybersabotage and  
the Threat of “Hybrid Warfare”
The notion of hybrid threats has been around for a long time in 
cybersecurity, traditionally referring to malware that has many 
different attack vectors―such as dropping malicious Trojan code 
onto an infected device and infecting other code on the system, 
while spreading itself through email or some other means. The 
term “hybrid warfare,” however refers to a type of warfare that 
is a combination of conventional and unconventional informa-
tion and cyber warfare. According to NATO, “the term appeared 
at least as early as 2005 and was subsequently used to describe 
the strategy used by the Hezbollah in the 2006 Lebanon War.”
It wasn’t until the end of 2015 where speculations about cybers-
abotage turned into real indications of one such attack. On 
December 23, a power failure hit the Ivano-Frankivisk region 
in western Ukraine. Details emerged over the coming days and 
weeks of a multi-pronged cyber attack that not only disabled 
power in eight provinces in the region, but also masked the 
activity of the attackers and made it difficult to assess the extent 
of the outage.
The malware behind the attack appears to be a potent combi-
nation of the BlackEnergy Trojan (Backdoor.Lancafdo) and 
Trojan.Disakil. In order to carry out the attack, the BlackEnergy 
Trojan was most likely used to traverse the network, allowing 
the attackers to gather information about the computers they 
compromised until they reached the critical systems that 
allowed them to disconnect breakers, resulting in the loss of 
electricity in the region. However, it doesn’t appear as though 
the Trojan itself disconnected the power. Rather, it allowed the 
attackers to discover the critical systems and then gain full 
control of them, after which they could use the original software 
on these systems to take down the power grid.
While noteworthy to this point, the attackers responsible appear 
to have planned the attack to such an extent that they were able 
to prolong the outage beyond the point it was pinpointed as an 
actual cyberattack. One way they were able to do this was by 
performing a telephone denial-of-service (TDoS) attack against 
the power supplier’s call center, preventing customers from 
calling in, and leaving operators in the dark as to the extent of 
the outage.
However, the one-two punch in the attack appears to be tied 
to the use of Trojan.Disakil in the attack. A highly destructive 
Trojan, Disakil was likely used to overwrite system files and wipe 
master boot records on computers that operators would turn to 
in order to bring the power back online. So not only was the 
power taken down, so too were the systems used to restore it, 
forcing operators to manually restore power in circumstances 
they normally would be able to do so through available software.
As with any cyber attack, attribution can be difficult to determine. 
Based on circumstantial evidence and current geopolitical 
disputes, it is fairly easy to draw conclusions; however, there is 
no smoking gun in this case. What is known is that the group 
behind the BlackEnergy Trojan has been active for many years 
and has targeted multiple organizations in the Ukraine, as well 
as Western European countries, NATO, and others. Around the 
time of these attacks, this group was also discovered attacking 
media organizations in the Ukraine. It is likely this won’t be the 
last we hear of them.
The cybersabotage attacks in Ukraine generated much debate 
about the use and effectiveness of hybrid warfare, and it is likely 
this won’t be the last we hear of these types of attacks, particu-
larly as international tensions remain high in some parts of the 
world, and managing the risks from cyberterrorism moves up 
the agenda for many national governments.
Small Business and the Dirty Linen Attack 
Of course, small businesses have smaller IT budgets, and conse-
quently spend less on cybersecurity than their large enterprise 
counterparts. However, this trend has continued for years, 
in spite evidence that shows a greater proportion of targeted 
spear-phishing attacks each year are intended for small busi-
nesses. 
In 2015, 43 percent of targeted spear-phishing blocked by 
Symantec were destined for small businesses, compared with 
34 percent in 2014. Additionally, the attackers focus narrowed, 
concentrating on fewer companies, and approximately 3 percent 
of small businesses were targeted in 2015, compared with 45 
percent in the previous year. On average, these organizations 
were targeted at least twice during the year. This shift from a 
scattergun approach of more widely dispersed attacks in 2014, 
to a more sniper-style line of attack converging on fewer targets 
in 2015 also helps to keep these attacks below the radar.
One of the most difficult challenges is knowing when your orga-
nization is in the sights of cyber attackers, particularly when 
most cybersecurity headlines focus on nation states vying for 
company secrets, and the tens of millions of credit card details 
and other personal data exposed in breaches. It’s all too easy to 
believe that a targeted attack only happens to other companies. 
However, no business is too small or too obscure to become a 
target and one good example that shows this is the Dirty Linen 
Attack.
Perhaps an unlikely target, General Linens Service, Inc. is a 
very small company, with only one location and 35 employees. 
They provide a linen service to restaurants and the hospitality 
industry, including uniforms and carpet cleaning. As unlikely a 
targeted as it would seem for a nation state, it was a competi-
tor, General Linen Services, LLC. that had been hidden in their 
network for two years. Perhaps the similar choice of company 
name was deliberate, because for two years they were able to 
steal customers by accessing the targeted company’s invoices, 
allowing them to see how much they were charging, giving them 
a significant advantage. The question was how they achieved 
this; a small business conducting cyberattacks on a rival seemed

TARGETED ATTACKS
extreme. However, it transpired that the attackers noticed that 
both companies used the same software for their web portal, 
and the targeted company had not changed the default admin-
istration password. This enabled the attackers to access their 
data 157 times. The good news is that General Linen Services, 
LLC was caught and convicted, and General Linens Service, Inc. 
discovered the importance of following security best practices.
Industrial Control Systems  
Vulnerable to Attacks
Industrial control systems (ICSs) are found in many areas of 
industrial production and utility services worldwide, and are 
routinely connected to the Internet for remote monitoring and 
control. Uncovering vulnerabilities in these systems is a major 
area of research, emphasized by the growth in the numbers of 
these vulnerabilities in 2015.
The actual number of vulnerabilities affecting ICSs is estimated 
to be much higher, since many organizations standardize their 
platforms by using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, 
such as Windows or Linux that are also subject to vulnerabilities, 
but which are not counted here. Furthermore, ICS management 
systems connected with enterprise networks can increase the 
potential exposure to threats more typically associated with 
these operating systems.
Vulnerabilities Disclosed in Industrial Control Systems

Obscurity is No Defense
The most valuable form of protection against cyberespionage is 
simply to be aware that it is possible. All businesses are poten-
tially vulnerable to targeted attacks using techniques such 
as watering hole attacks and spear phishing. Small size and 
obscurity are no protection. 
Indeed, in 2015 small businesses accounted for a greater propor-
tion (43 percent) of spear-phishing attacks, but the likelihood 
of being targeted diminished. While more attacks were destined 
for that group, they were focused on a smaller, more discreet 
number of businesses (3 percent). 
Contrast this with large enterprises, which accounted for 35 
percent of the spear-phishing attacks, and 1 in 2.7 (38 percent) 
were targeted at least once. This suggests a much more extensive 
scale where campaigns were more scattergun in their approach.
Having acknowledged the risk, organizations can take steps 
to protect themselves by reviewing their security and incident 
response plans, getting advice and help if required, updating the 
technical defenses, putting good personnel policies and training 
in place, and staying up to date with the latest information.   

DATA BREACHES LARGE 
AND SMALL 
Whether an insider attack, or 
criminal fraud focused on websites 
and point-of-sale devices, data 
breaches continued in 2015, costing 
victims more than ever. The number 
of mega-breaches climbed to 
the highest level since 2013. The 
number of breaches where the full 
extent of a breach was not revealed, 
increased; fewer companies declined 
to publish the numbers, unless 
required to do so by law.
The State of Play
Symantec figures show the total number of breaches has 
risen slightly by 2 percent in 2015. The year also saw nine 
mega-breaches, surpassing 2013’s record of eight breaches 
containing more than 10 million identities each. Another new 
record was set near the end of the year when 191 million identi-
ties were exposed, surpassing the previous record for the largest 
single data beach.
Helped in no small part by this massive breach, the overall total 
number of identities exposed has jumped 23 percent to 429 
million. What’s more concerning is that this number is likely 
much higher due to the increasing tendency of organizations to 
limit the information released about the extent of the breaches 
they suffer. In 2015, the number of breaches reported that 
did not include a figure for identities exposed increased by 85 
percent, from 61 to 113. Symantec estimates the total number 
of identities exposed, had these breaches been fully reported, is 
likely to be at least half a billion. 
It’s a staggering number, but also one full of speculation based 
on incomplete data. The median number of identities exposed 
per breach has decreased by around a third to 4,885 identities 
per breach. However, this does not lessen the cause for concern, 
but rather suggests the data stolen across breaches is more 
valuable and the impact to the business greater than in previous 
years.

As a result, cyber insurance claims are becoming more common. 
This year’s NetDiligence Cyber Claims study saw claims 
ranging up to US$15 million, while typical claims ranged from 
US$30,000 to US$263,000. But the cost of insuring digital assets 
is on the rise, contributing further to the rising overall cost of 
data breaches.
Average premiums for retailers surged 32 percent in the first 
half of 2015, and the healthcare sector saw some premiums 
triple. Reuters also reports that higher deductibles are now 
common and even the biggest insurers will not write policies for 
more than $100 million for risky customers.
Looking at industries across the broadest of categories, the 
Services sector was impacted by more data breaches than any 
other industry, both in terms of the number of incidents and the 
number of identities exposed. However, the reasons in each case 
differs when looking at the sub-sectors contained within these 
high-level classifications. 
The largest number of breaches took place within the Health 
Services sub-sector, which actually comprised 39 percent of all 
breaches in the year. This comes as no surprise, given the strict 
rules within the healthcare industry regarding reporting of data 
breaches. However, the number of identities exposed is relative-
ly small in this industry. Such a high number of breaches with 
low numbers of identities tends to show that the data itself is 
quite valuable to warrant so many small breaches.
The sub-sector responsible for the most identities exposed was 
Social Services. However, this is largely due to the record-break-
ing data breach responsible for 191 million identities exposed. 
Removing this one breach drops Social Services to the bottom 
of the list. (Coincidentally, this is where it falls within the list of 
sectors for number of breaches.)

DATA BREACHES & PRIVACY
This calls into question how risk factors into a data breach. An 
industry may suffer a large number of data breaches or expose 
a large number of identities, but does this mean that the data 
itself is being used for nefarious purposes? 
For instance, 48 percent of data breaches were caused by data 
accidentally being exposed. Personal data in these cases were 
indeed exposed, be it by a company sharing data with the wrong 
people or a misconfigured website that inadvertently made 
private records public. But was this data obtained by people with 
malicious intentions? In many cases, it’s likely that it was not. 
A retired grandmother who accidentally receives someone else’s 
healthcare record by email is unlikely to flip this information 
for identity theft. That’s not to say it never happens―just that a 
large majority of such data breaches are of a lower risk.
What is a much higher risk are cases where either hackers or 
insider theft was the cause of a breach. These are instances 
where the motive was very likely to steal data. To that end, here 
are some examples of high risk industries.

The Health Services sub-sector still tops the list for number of 
incidences, but it is now followed by the Hotels & Other Lodging 
Places sub-sector. Interestingly, 100 percent of breaches in this 
particular sub-sector included credit card information, but only 
seven percent actually reported the number of identities stolen. 
The Business Services sector dropped from second to third place 
when looking at high-risk causes. The companies breached in 
this sector are primarily dominated by online businesses and 
software manufacturers.
Top Sectors Filtered for Identities Exposed, 
Caused by Hacking and Insider Theft
Industry Sector Identities Exposed
1 Insurance Carriers 100,301,173 
2 Personal Services 40,500,000 
3 Administration of Human Resources 21,500,000 
4 Insurance Agents, Brokers,  & Service 19,600,000 
5 Business Services 18,405,914 
In terms of identities exposed in high-risk breaches, the 
Insurance Carriers and the Insurance Agents, Brokers, & Service 
sub-sectors both appear in the top five. Between these two 
sub-sectors lie almost half the mega-breaches seen in 2015. 
This presents one other interesting item: of the insurance-re-
lated breaches, almost 40 percent of them also contained 
healthcare records. Given the overlap between healthcare costs 
and insurance companies that cover such costs, this isn’t too 
surprising. What is concerning here is that attackers may have 
figured out that this highly prized data is available in insur-
ance-related sectors, and in much bigger numbers than found in 
small hospitals or private practices.
By Any Other Name 
The more details someone has about an individual, the easier it 
is to commit identity fraud. Criminals are targeting insurance, 
government, and healthcare organizations to get more complete 
profiles of individuals.
The types of information that thieves are persuing has not 
changed in 2015, save some minor changes in ranking. Real 
names are still the most common type of information exposed, 
present in over 78 percent of all data breaches. Home addresses, 
birth dates, Government IDs (like SSN), medical records, and 
financial information all appear in the 40 to 30 percent range, as 
in 2014, though their order of appearance has changes slightly. 
Rounding out the top 10, email addresses, phone numbers, 
insurance information, and user names/passwords again appear 
in 10 to 20 percent range.
This isn’t to say credit card data isn’t still a common target. Its 
black market value isn’t especially high on a per-card basis, since 
credit card companies are quick to spot anomalous spending 
patterns (as are credit card owners) and stolen card data and 
other financial information has a limited shelf life. However, 
there is still an evergreen market for stolen credit card data.

Retail remains a lucrative sector for criminals, although the 
introduction of the EMV standard, or ‘chip-and-PIN’ payment 
technology, in the US means the information criminals will 
be able to scrape from point-of-sale (POS) devices will be 
less valuable. EMV is a global standard for cards equipped 
with microchips, and the technology has been in use in some 
countries since 1990s and early 2000s. EMV is used to authen-
ticate chip-and-PIN transactions, and following numerous 
large-scale data breaches in recent years, and increasing rates 
of credit card fraud, credit card issuers in the US are migrating 
to this technology in a bid to reduce the impact of such fraud.
Previously, criminals could get hold of ‘Track 2’ data, which 
is shorthand for some of the data stored on a card’s magnetic 
strip. This made it easier to clone credit cards and use them in 
stores, or even in ATMs, if they had the PIN. Track 1 stores more 
information than Track 2, and contains the cardholder’s name, 
as well as account number and other discretionary data. Track 1 
is sometimes used by airlines when securing reservations with a 
credit card. The value of this data is reflected in the online black 
market sale prices, with Track 2 data costing up to US$100 per 
card. 
As of October 2015, 40 percent of US consumers have EMV 
cards, and 25 percent of merchants are estimated to be EMV 
compliant. With the move to the EMV standard, credit cards are 
much more difficult to clone, as they necessitate the use of a PIN 
in order to use them. And while the transition might take a few 
years to fully implement, alongside other improvements in POS 
security, it should make large-scale POS thefts more difficult 
and certainly less profitable for criminals.
The Insider Threat
While insider theft only accounted for around 10 percent of data 
breaches in 2015, the NetDiligence Cyber Claims study reported 
that there was insider involvement in 32 percent of the claims 
submitted in 2015. According to its CEO, a disgruntled insider 
was alleged to have been responsible for one of the most publi-
cized data breaches of the year, at Ashley Madison. Although 
this has not been confirmed, if true, it highlights the potential 
damage a malicious insider can inflict.

Insider threats have always been a hot topic in cybersecurity, 
but in 2015, government bodies not only started to take notice―
and take action.
   T More than three-quarters of US government agencies 
surveyed in the MeriTalk Federal Insider Threat Report say 
their agency is more focused on combating insider threats 
today than one year ago.
   T The UK’s Centre for Defence Enterprise sponsored several 
projects in 2015 aimed at monitoring employee digital 
behaviour to predict and identify insider threats in real 
time, as well as learning simulators to help people spot risk.
Privacy Regulation  
and the Value of Personal Data
Cybercriminals are not only interested in ‘who can hack,’ but 
also ‘who can leak.’ Whether data may be stolen in a data 
breach, accidentally leaked, or even posted online legitimate-
ly in the past, personal data has a value in the underground 
shadow economy. Until relatively recently, many people did not 
recognize the potential value in personally identifiable infor-
mation, and often were very lackadaisical in safeguarding it. 
The advent of social media in the last decade has enabled more 
people to share more personal data than at any time in history, 
and privacy controls were not at the forefront of many social 
networking applications. 
Personal data can and will be used to commit crimes, whether 
to conduct identity fraud, or to enhance the social engineering 
in phishing scams, or even as part of the reconnaissance in the 
prelude to a targeted attack. The recognition of the potential 
value of this data in the wrong hands has resulted in social 
networking services enhancing and tightening their privacy 
controls, and more people regarding their personal data with 
greater respect. For example, the European Court of Justice’s 
“right to be forgotten” ruling rippled through the data-gather-
ing community in May 2014 and by the end of 2015, Google had 
received 348,085 requests to delist specific search results.
While many thought this would only be of benefit to those 
wanting to hide scandal or avoid incrimination, according to 
Google’s FAQ, some of the most common cases for removal 
are sites that contain personal contact or address information 
or “content that relates solely to information about someone’s 
health, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, political 
affiliation and trade-union status”.
And the European Court of Justice sharpened the public’s focus 
on privacy again this year when it ruled the 2000 “Safe Harbor” 
agreement to be invalid. As Monique Goyens, director general 
of the European Consumer Organisation explained, the ruling 
confirms that “an agreement which allows US companies to 
merely declare that they adhere to EU data protection rules 
without any authority screening this claim is clearly not 
worth the paper it is written on.” As The Guardian newspaper 
commented at the time, it may “help stop the US government 
from being able to gain access to user data from the EU” and 
“may open the door to further probes, complaints, and lawsuits 
from users and data regulators.” 
However, in February 2016, The European Commission and the 
US agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows: 
the EU-US Privacy Shield. The new framework was designed 
to address the requirements set out by the European Court of 
Justice after ruling the old Safe Harbor framework invalid. The 
press release states, “The new arrangement will provide stronger 
obligations on companies in the US to protect the personal data 
of Europeans and stronger monitoring and enforcement by the 
US Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC), including through increased cooperation with European 
Data Protection Authorities.”
Surveying seven thousand people across Europe, Symantec’s 
2015 State of Privacy Report shows that in the UK alone, 49 
percent of consumers are worried their data is not safe. And 
across the EU, technology companies (22 percent), retailers (20 
percent) and social media companies (10 percent), were the least 
trusted. Symantec sees the lack of trust in these companies as a 
reputational issue, possibly stemming from recent high-profile 
data breach incidents.
We expect that reluctance to share personal information will 
grow and begin to change online behavior among consumers. 
One of the major reasons data privacy is becoming such a 
concern is because there is now a clear understanding amongst 
consumers that their data holds value. Providers of technology 
services should take heed when it comes to data privacy, because 
until the technology sector can be trusted to do the right thing 
by its consumers to safeguard that data, more work will need 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 56
DATA BREACHES & PRIVACY
to be done in the coming years to build and sustain the level of 
trust needed.
As data breaches proliferate and people’s lives increasingly 
move online, we expect to see more regulation and more judicial 
interest in the protection of individual privacy in 2016 and 
beyond. Businesses need to be more transparent with customers 
on how they are keeping data secure. Security needs to be 
embedded into a company’s value chain, but it should also be 
viewed internally as a customer-winning requirement, and not 
just a cost.
Ilias Chantzos, senior director in government affairs at 
Symantec commented, “There is a real consistency emerging 
that privacy is a competitive advantage for businesses and that 
privacy concerns also determine consumers’ behaviour. It is 
critical to ensure consumers are empowered to understand what 
their data is being used for and how it is protected.”
Reducing the Risk
While these are important steps, a large number of data 
breaches could also have been prevented with basic common 
sense, including:
   T Patching vulnerabilities
   T Maintaining good software hygiene
   T Deploying effective email filters
   T Using intrusion prevention and detection software
   T Restricting third-party access to company data
   T Employing encryption where appropriate to secure confi-
dential data
   T Implementing data loss prevention (DLP) technology
Of course, all of these relate to preventing outsider attacks. 
When it comes to mitigating the risk of malicious or acciden-
tal insider threats, organizations need to focus on employee 
education and data loss prevention. 
Basic security hygiene should be drilled into employees the 
same way the public are told to cover our mouths when we 
cough or sanitize our hands in hospitals. Organizations should 
also be making use of data loss prevention technology to locate, 
monitor, and protect their data―wherever it is within the orga-
nization―so that they know who is doing what, with what data, 
in real time. DLP can block certain types of data from leaving an 
organization, such as credit card numbers and other confiden-
tial documentation.
Security should be an essential part of operations and employee 
behavior, rather than an add-on or something to appease 
auditors. Data breaches are unlikely to stop any time soon, but 
the scale and impact of them could certainly be reduced if orga-
nizations recognized that security goes well beyond the bounds 
of the CIO or the IT manager. Security is in every employee’s 
hands.   

THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT
The underground economy is 
booming and cybercrime is 
growing fast, but as we have seen 
with the growing number of high-
profile arrests and takedowns in 
2015, wherever the cybercriminals 
may be, law enforcement is now 
catching-up with them much more 
quickly. Ransomware attacks have 
diversified, including targeting Linux 
web servers, and a growth in crypto-
ransomware.
Business in the Cyber Shadows
Cybercriminals are more professional and are much bolder, not 
only in the targets they go after, but also the sums of money they 
seek. These criminal enterprises see themselves as a fully-func-
tioning business, covering a multitude of areas, each with their 
own speciality. Just as legitimate businesses have partners, asso-
ciates, resellers, and vendors, so do those enterprises operating 
in the shadows.
While prices for email addresses on the black market have 
dropped in recent years, credit card prices have remained 
relatively low but stable. However, if they come with ‘luxury’ 
data—verification that the seller’s accounts are still active or 
that a credit card has not yet been blocked—they now fetch a 
premium price.
At the other end of the market, a drive-by download web toolkit, 
which includes updates and 24x7 support, can be rented for 
between US$100 and US$700 per week, while distributed 
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can be ordered from US$10 
to US$1,000 per day. And at the top of the market, a zero-day 
vulnerability can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Moreover, these figures have changes very little since 2014.SHARE

Stand and Deliver
Ransomware has become increasingly dominant in recent years 
and in 2014 many expected to see this trend continue. However, 
while we have seen ransomware attacks diversify, the growth in 
volume has not been seen. Attacks have moved to mobile devices, 
encrypting files, and anything else an owner will pay to recover.

Misleading Apps
In 2015, one Symantec researcher demonstrated that smart TVs 
were potentially vulnerable to ransomware, although this has 
not yet been observed in the wild.
Some ransomware now also threatens to publish the victim’s 
files online unless they pay―an interesting and sinister twist, 
which is likely to increase since the traditional advice of keeping 
effective backups, does not help in this scenario. 
Never before in the history of human kind have people across 
the world been subjected to extortion on a massive scale as they 
are today. But why are criminals favoring ransomware, especial-
ly crypto-ransomware? With the glut of stolen information on 
the black market and the introduction of the more secure EMV 
standard (chip-and-PIN) payment cards for card payments in 
the US, the potential profit criminals can gain by exploiting 
stolen credit card details had reduced.
Credit card fraud involves several people to conduct, and 
consumer legislation ensures the victim’s financial loss is 
minimized. In contrast, an attacker can obtain a ransomware 
toolkit from an underground source, and target their intended 
victims, who may have few alternatives but to pay-up. There are 
no middlemen for the criminal to pay and nothing to mitigate 
the losses to the victim, thus maximizing the profits. 
One crypto-ransomware tactic that seeks to increase the 
pressure on victims to pay-up, threatens to destroy the only 
copy of the secret key after a certain time, with the encrypted 
data potentially lost forever.
Crypto-Ransomware Over Time
    T While more traditional locker-style ransomware is showing a rapid decline, 
crypto-ransomware continues to grow. Crypto-ransomware employs very 
strong, ostensibly unbreakable key-based cryptography to hold a victim’s 
personal files to ransom by encrypting them with a key that only the 
criminals have access to.

Ransomware also targeted Linux web servers in 2015, encrypting 
files associated with web applications, archives, and back-ups. 
The evolution of Linux ransomware has also mirrored that of 
Windows ransomware: initial versions were basic, and often 
used poor encryption, making it relatively simple to recover 
encrypted files. However, just like with Windows ransomware, 
we can expect the criminals behind this new trend to quickly 
learn from their mistakes, and become more sophisticated in the 
future.
Global Issues, Local Attacks
With the build up to the presidential elections in the US, spam 
that leads to malware has been circulating that uses the US 
presidential primaries as bait. Spammers know how to play into 
visceral, emotive themes, like global events, the refugee crisis 
in the Middle East, immigration, and foreign policy issues, the 
economy, and even terrorism. 
In January 2015, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of the US 
military command were hacked by self-styled supporters of the 
jihadist terrorist group, ISIS (a.k.a. IS, ISIL or Daesh). US Central 
Command commented that it was, “cyber-vandalism” rather 
than a serious data breach.
However, in April 2015, French television network TV5 Monde 
reported that it had been hacked by a group claiming to belong 
to the terrorist group, ISIS. According to reports, its TV station 
was brought to a standstill, and its website and social media 
pages were also disrupted in the attack. The hackers posted 
documents that purported to be the identity cards, and CVs of 
relatives of French soldiers involved in anti-ISIS operations in 
Iraq and Syria.
Both examples highlight a clear-cut case of terrorists using 
cyberthreats as an instrument to amplify their messages. The 
Internet has become not only tool only for online radicalization, 
but also for communication between terrorist groups, and for 
financing their operations. As a consequence, the calls for law 
enforcement to break encryption protocols are likely to have a 
wider and long-lasting impact on the technological integrity of 
Internet communications as a whole.
In a refereence to terrorism, one recent email campaign imper-
sonated local law enforcement officials in the Middle East and 
Canada, tricking people into downloading malware by posing 
as security tips that would keep the intended victim safe from 
potential terror attacks in their location. The email spoofed the 
addresses of law enforcement agencies and included the names 
of officials who were all still in office at the time of the campaign. 
The subject lines in the emails often reflected the name of an 
employee who worked within the targeted company.
To make this type of attack convincing requires some degree of 
research, and here we have seen that this group did so before 
sending these phishing emails. Furthermore, without any 
employee information, they would email other people in the 
company as an entry point, such as customer services or IT 
personnel.

E-CRIME & MALWARE
This level of research and localisation indicates a growing profes-
sionalism, and is becoming increasingly common in botnet 
scams. The underground economy isn’t just about selling stolen 
goods: it’s an entire industry with the talented professionals and 
organisations you would expect in a legitimate business sector. 
Botnets and the Rise of the Zombies
As with many other industries, up and coming economies, 
such as China in particular, has become a favoured as target for 
cybercrime in 2015. One significant factor has been a growth 
in broadband adoption in the last year. In 2013, the Chinese 
Government announced plans to expand broadband coverage 
for both rural and urban areas by 2020. One of the milestones 
for the multi-pronged strategy aimed to bring fixed broadband 
connections to 400 million Chinese households by 2015. In 
addition, prices have been kept low as broadband speeds have 
increased. All of this make the country an attractive target for 
cybercriminals seeking to compromise a fresh source of high-
speed, internet-connected computers.
Malicious Activity by Source: Bots
    T China was the origin of much more bot activity in 2015, seeing a sharp 
rise of 84 percent in bot-related activity in that country. Bot activity in the 
US by contrast, fell by 67%. Successful law enforcement activity against 
cybercriminals, and heightened cybersecurity awareness are both 
contributing factors in the decline of bots in general.

The Dyre Consequences and Law Enforcement
After police shut down several major financial botnets in 2014, 
Dyre stepped up to take their place. Not only could Dyre hijack 
common web browsers and intercept Internet banking sessions 
to steal information, it could also download additional malware 
to the victim’s computer, binding it to the perpetrator’s network 
of botnet computers. 
Dyre Detections Over Time
    T The chart shows a decline in Dyre malware activity long before the botnet 
was disrupted in November 2015. This may be an indication of an already 
weakened business model.

Dyre had initially emerged as one of the most dangerous 
financial fraud operations, configured to defraud the customers 
of more than 1,000 banks and other companies worldwide. 
However, the cybercrime group controlling the Dyre financial 
fraud Trojan suffered a major blow following a Russian law 
enforcement operation in November. As outlined in a Security 
Response blog, Symantec telemetry has confirmed a virtual 
cessation of the group’s activities. Dyre (detected by Symantec 
as Infostealer.Dyre) was spread through email campaigns and 
no Dyre-related email campaigns have been observed since 
November 18, 2015. Detections of the Dyre Trojan and associ-
ated malware dropped dramatically soon after. Previously, the 
number of infections was estimated to be above 9,000 per month 
in early 2015. In November it fell to below 600 per month. 
Law enforcement has become more effective at catching cyber-
criminals like these, and high-profile successes at disrupting 
them shows how coordinated, international efforts can pay 
dividends. Rarely is an attack group confined to one country, and 
with major groups spanning multiple jurisdictions, cross-bor-
der cooperation with law enforcement is an important factor 
to ensure that these successes continue to strike a blow against 
cybercriminals. We expect to see still more successful law 
enforcement operations against cybercriminals in the next year.

As the risks for the cybercriminals intensify, the potential 
rewards will diminish, raising the barrier to entry for any 
would-be cybercriminals. Other notable successes in 2015 
included:
    T Dridex takedown. The Dridex botnet specialized in stealing 
bank credentials. In October, an international law enforce-
ment operation coordinated efforts to sinkhole thousands of 
compromised computers, cutting them off from the botnet’s 
control, and saw one man charged. However, this may have 
been a partial success as Dridex continues to propagate, 
indicating that many key elements of the operation are still 
functioning. As such, we expect the group to continue to 
pose a serious threat during 2016.
    T Simda takedown. In April, infrastructure owned by the Simda 
botnet’s controllers, including a number of command-and-
control servers, was seized by law enforcement. According to 
Interpol, “Simda was used by cyber criminals to gain remote 
access to computers enabling the theft of personal details, 
including banking passwords, as well as to install and spread 
other malware.”
    T Ramnit seizure. In February, a law enforcement operation 
led by Europol and assisted by, among others, Symantec and 
Microsoft, seized servers and other infrastructure owned by 
the cybercrime group behind the Ramnit botnet.
    T Multi-national banking and financial services fraud-related 
indictments. Federal authorities indicted at least four men in 
connection with hacking incidents that resulted in the theft 
of over 100 million customer records. They were charged 
with hacking into multiple financial institutions and for 
operating a stock pump-and-dump scheme. One of the 
attacks occurred in 2014, and netted more than 80 million 
customer records, a breach that the US Justice Depart-
ment dubbed the “largest theft of customer data from a US 
financial institution in history.”
Cybercrime and Keeping out of Harm’s Way
Organizations and individuals need to realise that even if they 
don’t think they’re an obvious target for cybercriminals, it 
doesn’t mean they’re not one. 
The key is to remain vigilant both on a personal level by:
   T Not opening emails from unknown senders.
   T Looking for the padlock and checking the SSL certificate on 
any sites where you enter sensitive data.
   T Not using unsecured networks when accessing sensitive 
data.
Remain vigilant at an organizational level by:
   T Deploying intrusion prevention and detection software.
   T Knowing what valuable data you have and harnessing data 
loss prevention technology.
   T Monitoring where data is, and who has access to it.
   T Ensuring you have a good incident response plan for when 
an attack is detected. It’s not a question of what to do if an 
attack occurs, but when.   

COMPUTERS, CLOUD COMPUTING 
AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE
IT systems continue to come 
under attack from rapidly evolving 
malware. No operating system is 
automatically immune, and malware 
threats against Linux and Mac 
OS X are increasing. Even cloud-
hosted and virtualized systems are 
vulnerable. Malware is able to seek-
out virtualized environments and 
infect them. 
Protecting the System 
The days of an operating system avoiding attacks simply by not 
being Windows is long behind us. Attacks against Mac OS X and 
Linux have both increased considerably in 2015 and cybersecu-
rity is a necessity across the board for all operating systems―not 
just for Windows―to avoid the consequences of attack. 
Cybersecurity affects everyone. Businesses need to protect their 
computers and IT infrastructure to stop data theft, fraud, and 
malware attacks. Likewise, businesses and consumers should 
be concerned about ransomware holding their data hostage, 
identity theft, and attackers using their computers as a spring-
board to attack others.  
At a fundamental level, cybersecurity is about protecting the 
sinews of IT everywhere: computers, servers, and networks. The 
problem is that malware is ubiquitous. In 2015, we have seen 
many more systems come under attack, including Linux, Macs, 
virtualized computers, and cloud systems. Each year, the cloud 
handles more of our data, whether it is for customer relation-
ship management, invoicing services, social networking, mobile 
email, and a whole gamut of other applications 
One route for attacks is through exploiting vulnerabilities, and 
most systems have vulnerabilities. These exist in the operating 
systems and applications used on them, and are an important 
aspect of cybersecurity. If left unpatched, a vulnerability may

leave the path clear for would-be attackers to exploit them 
and use them for malicious purposes. Each year, researchers 
uncover new vulnerabilities, and the most coveted of these are 
zero-days, a special type of vulnerability for which a patch is not 
yet available.

Germophobes may not like it, but bacteria and viruses cover 
every surface. They live on our skin and in the air, and they 
are not going away. Likewise, vulnerabilities are a part of the 
computing environment. They are not going away either, and a 
slipshod approach to patching―whether through carelessness, 
misconfiguration, human error, or negligence―is a major cause 
of malware infections. Well-managed, well-patched systems are 
much less likely to become infected.
Nothing Is Automatically Immune
In the last year, Symantec has seen threats to almost every kind 
of computer, operating system, and other essential IT services, 
including:
    T Mac OS X. In addition to more vulnerabilities being 
uncovered in 2015, proof-of-concept ransomware and 
several methods for Trojans to gain unauthorised access to 
affected computers were also discovered.
    T MySQL. Symantec researchers discovered malware that 
attacks MySQL―a very popular database system―and uses it 
to launch denial-of-service attacks on other systems.
    T Linux. There was a rapid growth in Linux malware in 2015, 
including attack kits that hackers can use to infect unpatched 
Linux web servers.
    T Virtualised systems. Even virtualised systems are not 
immune. Sixteen percent of malware is routinely able to 
recognize and exploit a virtual machine environment, and 
vulnerabilities such as VENOM could allow an attacker to 
escape an infected virtual machine and attack others on the 
same system, or even attack the host hypervisor.
Mac OS X
Apple’s Mac OS X operating system was targeted for a variety 
of attacks in 2015, including a proof-of-concept ransomware 
threat called Mabouia (detected as OSX.Ransomcrypt), the first 
effective file-based ransomware threat against OS X. Previously, 
browser-based threats against Macs have been found, including 
ransomware targeting Safari through a malicious website.
Moreover, the volume of OS X malware has doubled (100% 
growth) since the start of 2015. In Q1, Symantec blocked approx-
imately 3,650 attacks each day, rising to 7,255 by the end of Q4.

has become an attractive target for hackers because with access 
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 65
CLOUD & INFRASTRUCTURE
to one server, an attacker can potentially infect all of the websites 
hosted on it, and in turn all of their visitors and customers.
Attackers will often contaminate compromised web servers with 
code that links to exploit toolkits, or they to send spam emails 
and steal usernames and passwords. Additionally, compromised 
web servers are often a springboard from which an attacker will 
conduct a wide variety of other attacks, including very powerful 
DDoS attacks, where the bandwidth of a hosting provider is 
considerably greater than that of a home-user with a broadband 
connection.
A proliferation of specialized, automated attack toolkits have 
emerged, making it easier for cyber criminals to carry attacks 
against Linux systems. These toolkits help attackers to sniff-out 
potentially vulnerable servers, scanning for insecure content 
management systems and other exposed web applications.
Ransomware targeting Linux was also uncovered in 2015, 
targeted in particular files with extensions associated with web 
applications. The program also encrypted archives and direc-
tories that contained the word ‘backup,’ making it particularly 
difficult for anyone without offsite backups. 
Cloud and Virtualized Systems
The term “cloud computing” covers a wide variety of technical 
solutions and environments, including software-as-a-service 
(SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-ser-
vice (IaaS) models. IaaS is growing in popularity among 
businesses, and as more data and services move to the cloud, 
it is attracting more attention from security researchers and 
cybercriminals. As with any system, each time a new layer 
is introduced to a service stack, the attack surface increases. 
While cloud environments may suffer from common vulnera-
bilities, such as SQL injection flaws, they may also be impacted 
by other issues. For example, in 2015, Symantec found that 
misconfiguration and poor management (by users, not cloud 
service providers) left cloud-hosted systems vulnerable to 
unauthorized access. Additionally, 11,000 publicly accessible 
files―some containing sensitive personal information―were 
also unearthed. Stolen credentials for cloud-based systems are 
regularly traded on underground markets, typically for less than 
US$10.
Cloud Vulnerabilities
It is not necessarily the case that cloud systems are inherently 
less-secure than traditional IT services. Nevertheless, admin-
istrators need to ensure that the cloud services they use are 
properly configured and all data is adequately protected. They 
should take care to control access to their cloud systems, prefer-
ably with two-factor authentication.
Vulnerabilities, like VENOM, could allow an attacker to escape 
from a guest virtual machine (VM) and access the native host 
operating system, along with other VMs running on the same 
platform. Attackers exploiting the VENOM bug could poten-
tially steal sensitive data on any of the virtual machines on the 
affected system, and gain elevated access to the host’s local 
network and its systems. The VENOM bug (CVE-2015-3456) 
existed since 2004 in the open-source hypervisor QEMU, which 
is often installed by default in a number of virtualized infra-
structures using Xen, QEMU, and KVM. However, it is important 
to note that VENOM does not affect VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, 
and Bochs hypervisors.
To date, the VENOM bug has not known to have been exploited 
in the wild, and QEMU’s developers and other affected vendors 
have since created and distributed patches for VENOM.
One in six (16 percent) malware variants is able to detect the 
presence of a virtualized environment, compared with one in 
five (20 percent) in 2014. This ability can help the malware to 
better evade detection, particularly on security sandboxing 
systems using virtualization. More concerning is that an attack 
may detect when it is able to exploit and infect other virtual 
machines on the same system.
Proportion of Malware Samples  
That Are Virtual Machine Aware
    T Approximately 16 percent of malware is routinely able to detect and identify 
the presence of a virtual machine environment, peaking at around 22 
percent in Q4.

Having a robust security profile for virtual systems is now more 
important than ever.  Virtual machines and cloud services need 
securing in the same way as other services and devices. Policies 
should cover the virtual infrastructure as well as the physical 
one, and the use of integrated security tools across all platforms 
will help to mitigate such problems in the future.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 66
CLOUD & INFRASTRUCTURE
Protecting the IT infrastructure
In the face of these threats, and many others like them, the old 
advice holds good for any infrastructure services, including file 
servers, web servers, and other Internet-connected devices:
   T Stay informed about emerging threats.
   T Keep systems up to date with patches and updates.
   T Use integrated security software, including anti-malware 
technology.
   T Use a strong firewall that only permits known traffic, and 
review access logs regularly to detect potentially suspicious 
activity. 
   T Employ multi-layer protection, so if one layer is compro-
mised, there are other layers to protect different areas the 
system.
   T Apply good policies and train staff well.
   T Control access on a least-privilege basis.
   T Deploy network intrusion prevention and detection and 
monitor email services running on the server.
   T Always keep backups offsite.
Be concerned about cloud systems too. Here are some additional 
considerations:
   T Safeguard all credentials used to access the cloud-based 
administration functions and ensure access is controlled on 
a need-to-know basis.
   T Ensure that you understand the settings of your cloud 
resources and configure them accordingly.
   T Enable event logging to keep track of who is accessing data 
in the cloud.
   T Read the cloud providers’ service-level agreements to learn 
how data in the cloud is secured.
   T Include cloud IP addresses in vulnerability management 
processes and perform audits on any services that are 
provided through the cloud.
Protect Information Wherever It Is
As companies move their IT systems to virtual and cloud-host-
ed environments, they face new security challenges. In addition, 
as ever, human nature itself is a threat, with poorly-managed 
security leading to shadow IT systems. Shadow IT refers to 
solutions used inside organizations without explicit organiza-
tional approval, and solutions used by departments other than 
the IT department. It can sometimes be all too easy for a group 
of employees to turn to external products to fulfil an immediate 
need. IT decision makers should understand what is influenc-
ing their employees to turn to these solutions, and when the IT 
department should be involved to help shape those decisions.
It is important for the CIO to understand what the organization 
is doing, and whether certain teams are looking for services or 
applications that are not provided for, then determine how to 
address that need and offer that service in a secure fashion. 
Having the right processes is key to protecting information and 
data, even when it is not housed inside the enterprise. 
DDOS ATTACKS AND BOTNETS 
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) 
attacks are growing in number 
and intensity, but most last for 30 
minutes or less. The availability of 
botnets-for-hire has fueled this 
increase and we are likely to see 
the Internet of Things provide more 
fodder for these botnet armies.
DDoS at Large
Some DDoS attacks can still afford criminals many opportu-
nities for financial reward through extortion and blackmail by 
disrupting an organization’s website. Following the money trail 
made this more difficult and DDoS mitigation technologies 
meant the attackers needed greater and greater bandwidth in 
order to make an impact. More recently, however, it is hacktivist 
groups and sometimes state actors that are complicit in some of 
the biggest attacks.
The recent attack on the BBC, which saw its website and asso-
ciated services including iPlayer (the BBC’s Internet catch-up 
TV and radio service in the UK) taken down for several hours 
on New Year’s Eve, is a prime example. It is thought to be the 
biggest ever DDoS attack, according to New World Hacking, the 
anti-Islamic State organisation that claimed responsibility. The 
attackers claimed that the BBC’s scale offered a chance for them 
to test their capabilities and claim the attack reached a peak of 
602 Gbps.
There are rewards to be gained through a DDoS attack, the 
most obvious being blackmail. Victims are threated to pay or 
have their sites remain under attack. DDoS has also been used 
as a “distraction” tool in conjunction with some high-profile 
targeted attacks in 2015, where attackers flooded the website of 
the targeted organisation, leaving the IT team believing it was 
the prelude to a ransom demand. In reality, another, stealthier 
attack was quietly taking place at the same time.

Different attack groups have different preferences for their 
DDoS campaigns, and ICMP flood attacks were one of the main 
methods used by the Darkness/Optima botnet. Some methods, 
particularly amplification attacks, may no longer work that 
well over time. For example, when the media extensively covers 
a high-profile attack, more people will patch their servers. In 
addition, botnets that were used to perform previous attacks 
may be taken down or upgraded to newer versions that provide 
new functionality.
Simple but Effective
So why are DDoS attacks so popular? The answer is the same 
now as it was when we first wrote about them in December 2002: 
they are simple to set up, difficult to stop, and very effective. 
This is truer than ever with the rise of botnets-for-hire. 
Botnets-for-hire were implicated in roughly 40 percent of all 
DDoS network layer attacks in the second quarter of 2015, 
according to Incapsula, a Symantec partner. While criminals 
can go to the effort of infecting multiple vulnerable devices and 
creating their own botnet to carry out DDoS attacks, it’s often 
much easier to hire pre-made botnets for a set amount of time.
Prices remained fairly steady in the black market in 2015, where 
DDoS attacks can be ordered from just US$10 to US$1,000 per 
day. The cost to a business will be significantly higher, perhaps 
as much as a thousand times greater, depending on the nature 
of the business and the importance of the company’s website. 
In 2015, Incapsula reported a DDoS attack can cost an organiza-
tion as much as US$40,000 per hour. Consequently the potential 
rewards for an attacker successfully holding a company to 
ransom in this way will more than compensate for their costs. 
For example, one Australian email provider was attacked and 
attackers demanded a payment of 20 Bitcoins, worth about 
US$6,600. Another company that paid the demand was soon 
subjected to another assault shortly afterwards.

These shorter hit-and-run style attacks are indicative of a shift 
towards the greater use of DDoS being offered as a service, 
where subscribers are allotted limited access to the overall 
botnet resources, which are shared with other subscribers. 
This will usually be sufficient for them to conduct a few short-
er-duration, mid-sized attacks. This can also help the attackers 
determine how effective the target infrastructure is at miti-
gating such attacks, and whether they need to increase the 
volume. Incapsula also reported that 100+ Gbps attacks became 
commonplace and a 100+ Gbps attack was mitigated once every 
other day.
The rise in popularity of DDoS-as-a-service corresponds with 
the significant drop in network layer attack duration in the third 
quarter of 2015 compared with the second quarter. Some of 
these DDoS-for-hire services refer to themselves as “stressers,” 
because conducting a DDoS attack is illegal, they hide behind a 
veil, inferring they can be used for “stress testing” server resil-
ience.

What’s in a Botnet?
Botnets are key to DDoS attacks, whether they’re hired or 
created by the criminals carrying out the attack. The bigger 
the botnet, the more simultaneous requests it can send and the 
more disruptive the attack will be.
But it’s not just infected PCs that are providing criminals with 
their robot army. In October, we saw malware target MySQL 
servers, which often offer a much larger bandwidth capacity for 
an attack than traditional consumer PCs. This method isn’t new, 
but it shows criminals are continuing to create bigger and better 
botnets.
In 2015, we also saw criminals making increasing use of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) to strengthen their botnet ranks. CCTV 
cameras proved particularly popular, likely because they are one 
of the most common IoT devices, with 245 million profession-
ally installed video surveillance cameras active and operational 
globally in 2014.
Looking ahead, it’s likely that criminals will make increasing use 
of vulnerable IoT devices to execute large-scale DDoS attacks. 
While solutions exist to mitigate against DDoS attack, organiza-
tions will also face new challenges in implementing appropriate 
security on non-traditional devices to ensure they don’t become 
part of the problem. Perhaps more concerning, without the right 
security in place, it will be even more difficult to know when 
your printer, or refrigerator, thermostat, or toaster is actually 
part of a toxic global botnet.   

2016 Internet Security Threat Report 69
Why is Cybersecurity so Important?
This is the 21st edition of the Symantec Internet Security Threat 
Report and much has changed since the first one. Each year we 
take a fresh look at the structure and contents of the report. As 
well as focusing on the threats and reporting the findings from 
our research, Symantec also tracks industry trends, and in the 
report, we try to highlight the important developments and 
look to future trends. This goes beyond just looking at computer 
systems, smartphones, and other products, and extends into 
broad concepts like national security, the economy, data protec-
tion, and privacy. 
Cybersecurity Matters
This report takes a high-level view of cybersecurity and Internet 
threats, underlining the notable changes and developments. 
However, we must not forget that cybercrime is not victimless. 
For example, ransomware locks people out of their computers, 
holding treasured family photos to ransom, hijacking unfin-
ished manuscripts for novels, and blocking access to tax returns, 
banking records, and other valuable documents. Moreover, 
there are no guarantees that paying the ransom will release 
those padlocks. Businesses, as well as home users, have become 
victims, and relying on backups is often the last line of defense 
when cybersecurity should really be the first.
Targeted attacks steal invaluable intellectual property from 
businesses, and a data breach can shred an organization’s repu-
tation―even threatening its survival. Cyber insurance claims 
are growing in number and cost, pushing premiums even higher. 
In the broadest sense, cybersecurity problems threaten national 
security and economic growth, which ultimately affects us all.
Web Security and the Industry’s Responsibility
Updates to protect against such vulnerabilities are released 
regularly, including for SSL/TLS protocol libraries, such as 
OpenSSL, but website owners still have to install them. We 
have seen in this report and over the past few years that this 
is still not happening quickly enough. The number of vulnera-
ble websites continues to persist year after year, with very little 
improvement to show. While the move from SHA-1 certificates 
to the much stronger SHA-2 is gaining momentum, organiza-
tions must deploy the new certificates properly in order for the 
changes to be effective. 
Criminals continued to find vulnerabilities in the underlying 
infrastructure of website security in 2015, exploiting weakness-
es in the underlying encryption systems, allowing attackers 
to intercept and control secure connections. The wider debate 
around security, privacy, and strong encryption will ultimately 
affect all of us.
Nothing Is Automatically Immune
No system is automatically immune from cyber threats, and 
in this report, the consequences of ignoring the risks from 
complacency, negligence, and incompetence are clear. In 2015, 
an unprecedented number of vulnerabilities were identified as 
zero-day exploits that have been weaponized, and web attack 
exploit kits are adapting and evolving them more quickly than 
ever. As more devices are connected, vulnerabilities will be 
exploited. Safeguarding Internet-connected devices will become 
critically important to ensuring the safety of industrial control 
systems (ICS) and medical devices in the community.
Alongside the rising number of software vulnerabilities, and 
the parade of attacks on different systems, the future will bring 
with it a greater range of diversity as threats against Windows 
systems will extend to other operating systems, mobile, and 
other IoT devices.
Digital Hygiene and a Cleaner Future 
In cybersecurity, we often talk about infections and viruses. 
But the state of ubiquitous attacks, epic data breaches, and 
advanced threats we have seen this year suggest that there are 
better medical analogies. Instead of infection, we might think of 
disease both chronic and acute, serious, and benign. 
Instead of thinking in binary terms of infection-free and compro-
mised, we should move to a wellness model that considers 
susceptibility, resilience, wellness, vulnerability to infection, 
and recoverability. As IT security professionals, we should 
emphasize prevention, detection, and mitigation, as well as a 
complete cure. Concepts borrowed from epidemiology, incident 
response planning, and tools such as security simulation are 
becoming more important and useful.
For individuals and companies, Internet security is going to 
be much more like ‘wellness’ and ‘hygiene’ than ‘medicine,’ 
and focused on the routine of prevention rather than looking 
for a panacea or cure. We all need to stay digitally healthy and 
digitally clean, and habits of security will need to be relearned, 
over and over again. 
Similarly, IT departments need to be proactive in reducing 
the risk from persistent intrusions and malware, and identify 
breaches quickly. Unfortunately, discovering attacks quickly 
requires constant, active vigilance. Information security can’t 
wait for support tickets to open or for a favored security tool to 
identify an issue conclusively. Security needs to start digging 
through the data proactively during non-breach response time. 
CONCLUSIONS
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 70
As an industry, we need to start moving into a more investiga-
tive, clinical-study mindset where we are constantly researching 
the habits or artifacts that cause the “digital diseases.” Taking 
risks with cybersecurity will be seen as unacceptable, perhaps 
anathema akin to driving a car while under the influence of 
alcohol. 
Cybersecurity is not just about employing the right kind of 
technology, it also requires good digital hygiene on the part of 
everyone; both at home, and in the office. Education and greater 
awareness of cybersecurity issues will help everyone to become 
more digitally healthy. By being aware of just how many risks 
you face, you can reduce them, and learn how to recognize 
symptoms, and diagnose “digital diseases” before they put your 
data, and your customers’ data at risk. We should reject the 
misconception that privacy no longer exists. Privacy is precious, 
and should be protected carefully.   

TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 71
Employ Defense-in-Depth Strategies 
Emphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive 
defensive systems to guard against single-point failures in any 
specific technology or protection method. This should include 
the deployment of regularly updated firewalls as well as gateway 
antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), 
website vulnerability with malware protection, and web security 
gateway solutions throughout the network.
Monitor for Network Incursion Attempts, 
Vulnerabilities, and Brand Abuse
Receive alerts for new vulnerabilities and threats across vendor 
platforms for proactive remediation. Track brand abuse via 
domain alerting and fictitious website reporting.
Antivirus on Endpoints Is Not Enough
On endpoints, it is important to have the latest versions of 
antivirus software installed. Deploy and use a comprehensive 
endpoint security product that includes additional layers of 
protection, including:
   T Endpoint intrusion prevention that protects unpatched 
vulnerabilities from being exploited, protects against social 
engineering attacks, and stops malware from reaching 
endpoints.
   T Browser protection for avoiding obfuscated web-based 
attacks.
   T File and web-based reputation solutions that provide a 
risk-and-reputation rating of any application and website to 
prevent rapidly mutating and polymorphic malware.
   T Behavioral prevention capabilities that look at the behavior 
of applications and prevent malware.
   T Application control settings that can prevent applications 
and browser plugins from downloading unauthorized 
malicious content.
   T Device control settings that prevent and limit the types of 
USB devices to be used.
Secure Websites Against Attacks and Malware 
Infection
Avoid compromising your trusted relationship with customers 
by regularly assessing your website for vulnerabilities and 
malware. Additionally, consider:
   T Choosing SSL Certificates with Extended Validation to 
display the green browser address bar to website users.
   T Displaying recognized trust marks in highly visible 
locations on your website to show customers your commit-
ment to their security.
Protect Private Keys
Make sure to get your digital certificates from an established, 
trustworthy certificate authority that demonstrates excellent 
security practices. Symantec recommends that organizations:
   T Use separate Test Signing and Release Signing infrastruc-
tures.
   T Secure keys in secure, tamper-proof, cryptographic 
hardware devices.
   T Implement physical security to protect your assets from 
theft.
Use Encryption and DLP to Protect Sensitive 
Data
Implement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive 
data is encrypted. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as 
well. This not only serves to prevent data breaches, but can also 
help mitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within an 
organization. 
Access to sensitive information should be restricted. This 
should include a Data Loss Protection (DLP) solution that can 
help prevent data breaches and minimize their impact. 
   T Implement a DLP solution that can discover where sensitive 
data resides, monitor its use, and protect it from loss.
   T Monitor the flow of information as it leaves the organi-
zation over the network, and monitor traffic to external 
devices or websites.
   T DLP should be configured to identify and block suspicious 
copying or downloading of sensitive data.
   T DLP should also be used to identify confidential or sensitive 
data assets on network file systems and computers.

2016 Internet Security Threat Report 72
Ensure All Devices Allowed on Company 
Networks Have Adequate Security Protections
If a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy is in place, ensure a 
minimal security profile is established for any devices that are 
allowed access to the network.
Implement a Removable Media Policy
Where practical, restrict unauthorized devices, such as external 
portable hard-drives and other removable media. Such devices 
can both introduce malware and facilitate intellectual property 
breaches, whether intentional or unintentional. If external 
media devices are permitted, automatically scan them for 
viruses upon connection to the network and use a DLP solution 
to monitor and restrict copying confidential data to unencrypt-
ed external storage devices.
Be Aggressive in Updating and Patching
Update, patch, and migrate from outdated and insecure 
browsers, applications, and browser plugins. This also applies 
to operating systems, not just across computers, but mobile, 
ICS, and IoT devices as well. Keep virus and intrusion preven-
tion definitions at the latest available versions using vendors’ 
automatic updates. 
Most software vendors work diligently to patch exploited 
software vulnerabilities; however, such patches can only be 
effective if adopted in the field. Wherever possible, automate 
patch deployments to maintain protection against vulnerabili-
ties across the organization.
Enforce an Effective Password Policy
Ensure passwords are strong. Passwords should be at least 8-10 
characters long and include a mixture of letters and numbers. 
Encourage users to avoid re-using the same passwords on 
multiple websites and sharing passwords with others should be 
forbidden. Passwords should be changed regularly, at least every 
90 days.
Ensure Regular Backups Are Available
Create and maintain regular backups of critical systems, as 
well as endpoints. In the event of a security or data emergency, 
backups should be easily accessible to minimize downtime of 
services and employee productivity.
Restrict Email Attachments
Configure mail servers to block or remove email that contains 
file attachments that are commonly used to spread viruses, such 
as .VBS, .BAT, .EXE, .PIF, and .SCR files. Enterprises should inves-
tigate policies for .PDFs that are allowed to be included as email 
attachments. Ensure that mail servers are adequately protected 
by security software and that email is thoroughly scanned.
Ensure Infection and Incident Response 
Procedures Are in Place
   T Keep your security vendor contact information handy; know 
who you will call, and what steps you will take if you have 
one or more infected systems.
   T Ensure that a backup-and-restore solution is in place in 
order to restore lost or compromised data in the event of 
successful attack or catastrophic data loss.
   T Make use of post-infection detection capabilities from 
web gateway, endpoint security solutions and firewalls to 
identify infected systems.
   T Isolate infected computers to prevent the risk of further 
infection within the organization, and restore using trusted 
backup media.
   T If network services are exploited by malicious code or some 
other threat, disable or block access to those services until a 
patch is applied.
Educate Employees
As ever, basic common sense and the introduction of good 
security habits can go a long way to keeping sites and servers 
safe this year.
   T Do not open attachments unless they are expected and 
come from a known and trusted source, and do not execute 
software that is downloaded from the Internet (if such 
actions are permitted) unless from a trusted source or the 
download has been scanned for malware.
   T Be cautious when clicking on URLs in emails or social media 
programs, even when coming from trusted sources and 
friends.
   T Deploy web browser URL reputation plugin solutions that 
display the reputation of websites from searches.
   T Restrict software to corporate-approved applications, if 
possible, and avoid downloading software from file sharing 
sites. Only download packages directly from trusted 
vendors’ websites.
BEST PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR BUSINESSES
TABLE OF CONTENTS
2016 Internet Security Threat Report 73
   T Educate users on safe social media conduct. Offers that 
look too good usually are, and hot topics are prime bait for 
scams. Not all links lead to real login pages.
   T Encourage them to adopt two-step authentication on any 
website or app that offers it.
   T Ensure they have different passwords for every email 
account, applications and login―especially for work-related 
sites and services.
   T Remind then to use common sense. Having antivirus and 
security software doesn’t mean it is ok to visit malicious or 
questionable websites. 
   T Encourage employees to raise the alarm if they see anything 
suspicious. For example, if Windows users see a warning 
indicating that they are “infected” after clicking on a 
URL or using a search engine (indicative of fake antivirus 
infections), educate users to close or quit the browser using 
Alt-F4, CTRL+W or to use the task manager, and then notify 
the helpdesk.
Protect Mobile Devices
We recommend that people and employers treat mobile 
devices like the small, powerful computers that they are and 
protect them accordingly using:
   T Access control, including biometrics where possible.
   T Data loss prevention, such as on-device encryption.
   T Automated device backup.
   T Remote find and wipe.
   T Regular updating. For example, the latest version of 
Android, codenamed ‘Honeycomb’, includes a number of 
features designed specifically to thwart attackers.
   T Common sense. Don’t jailbreak devices and only use trusted 
app markets.
   T Training, particularly around paying attention to permis-
sions requested by an app.
   T Security solutions such as Symantec Mobility or Norton 
Mobile Security
We have seen the number of mobile vulnerabilities increase 
every year over the past three years―although this is perhaps 
an indicator of progress rather than a cause for despair.  It 
is an indication that security researchers, operating system 
developers and app writers are, in fact, paying more attention 
to mobile security by identifying and fixing more problems. 
Although we expect mobile devices to come under growing 
attack over the next year, there is also hope that with the right 
preventative measures and continuing investment in security, 
users can achieve a high level of protection against them.
Building Security into Devices
The diverse nature of ICS and IoT platforms make host-based 
intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention 
systems (IPS), with customizable rulesets and policies that are 
unique to a platform and application, suitable solutions. 
However, manufacturers of ICS and IoT devices are largely 
responsible for ensuring that security is built into the devices 
before shipping. 
Building security directly into the software and applications 
that run on the ICS and IoT devices should prevent many 
attacks that manage to side-step defenses at the upper layers. 
Manufacturers should adopt and integrate such principles 
into their software development processes.
Business users and consumers need to be assured that 
suppliers are fundamentally building security into the IoT 
devices that they are buying, rather than it being considered 
as a bolt-on option.
It’s a Team Effort
Consumer confidence is built up over multiple interactions 
across numerous websites owned by countless different orga-
nizations. But it only takes one bad experience of stolen data 
or a drive-by download to tarnish the reputation of every 
website in the consumer’s mind.
As we said at the start of the report, there is a real opportu-
nity in the coming year to reduce the number of successful 
web attacks and limit the risks websites potentially pose to 
consumers, but it will take commitment and action from 
website owners for it to become a reality.
Adopt Complete Website Security in 2016, and together with 
Symantec, make it a good year for cybersecurity and a very 
bad one for cybercriminals.   

For website security to be effective, it has to be implemented with 
care and attention and it has to be monitored and maintained 
continually.
While there are tools to help you keep your website ecosystem 
secure, it all starts with education. You’ve read about the risks―
now find out what you can do about them.
Get in line with industry standards
    T Implement always-on SSL. Implement SSL/TLS on every 
page of your website so that every interaction a visitor has 
with your site is encrypted. Switching to ‘HTTPS everywhere’, 
as it’s also called, with OV or EV SSL/TLS certificates demon-
strates your credibility and can also improve your search 
rankings and paves the way for an upgrade to HTTP/2, deliv-
ering better performance.
    T Migrate to SHA-2. As discussed in the report, certificate 
authorities should have stopped issuing SHA-1 certificates as 
of 1 January 2016, but you need to ensure any legacy certifi-
cates are also upgraded and that any devices and applications 
that may not currently recognize SHA-2 are upgraded too. 
    T Consider adopting ECC. Symantec also offers the use of the 
ECC encryption algorithm. All major browsers, even mobile, 
support ECC certificates on all the latest platforms, and 
compared to an industry-standard 2048-bit RSA key, 256-bit 
ECC keys are 64,000 times harder to crack.
Use SSL/TLS Correctly
SSL/TLS is only as good as its implementation and maintenance. 
So be sure to:
    T Keep protocol libraries up to date. SSL/TLS implementation 
is an on-going task and it’s vital that any patches or updates 
to the software you use are implemented as soon as possible.
    T Don’t let your certificates expire. Keep track of what certif-
icates you have, from which certificate authority, and when 
they are due to expire. Symantec offers a range of automation 
tools to help you do this, giving you more time for proactive 
security tasks.
    T Display recognized trust marks. Display trust marks (such as 
the Norton Secured Seal) in highly visible locations on your 
website to show customers your commitment to their security. 
Manage your SSL/TLS keys properly. Limit the number of people 
with access to them; have separate administrators for managing 
the passwords for the server where they’re kept and for managing 
the systems they’re actually stored in; and use automated certifi-
cate and key management systems to reduce human involvement.
Any breach affecting SSL keys should be notified to the CA 
quickly, so that corresponding certificates can be revoked.
Adopt Comprehensive Website Security
    T Scan regularly. Keep an eye on your web servers and watch 
for vulnerabilities or malware. Automation tools can help 
with this.
    T Use antivirus. Antivirus software isn’t just for PCs and smart-
phones―it’s for servers too and could help prevent a serious 
malware attack against your entire website infrastructure.
    T Be picky about your plugins. The software you use to manage 
your website comes with vulnerabilities too. The more 
third-party software you use, the greater your attack surface; 
so only deploy what’s absolutely necessary.
    T Consider the whole ecosystem. Have you deployed a Web 
Application Firewall to defend against injection attacks? Is 
your code signing secure for your web apps? Do you have 
automated tools to detect and defend against the increasingly 
common problem of DDoS attacks? 
Symantec offers a range of tools that makes maintaining complete 
website security a straightforward and efficient task.
Avoid Compromising Trusted Relationships with 
Customers by:
   T Regularly assessing your website for any vulnerabilities. 
   T Scanning your website daily for malware.
   T Setting the secure flag for all session cookies.
   T Securing your websites against man-in-the-middle (MITM) 
attacks and malware infection. 
   T Choosing SSL Certificates with Extended Validation to 
display the green browser address bar to website users.
   T Displaying recognized trust marks in highly visible locations 
on your website to show customers your commitment to 
their security.
There Is No ‘I’ in Team
Consumer confidence is built up over multiple interactions across 
numerous websites owned by countless different organizations. It 
only takes one bad experience to tarnish the reputation of every 
single one in the consumer’s mind.
As we said in the report, there exists a real opportunity in the 
coming year to reduce the number of successful web attacks and 
limit the risks your website potentially poses to consumers, but 
it will take commitment and action from website owners for it to 
become a reality.
Adopt comprehensive website security in 2016 and, together with 
Symantec, make it a good year for cyber security and a very bad 
one for cybercriminals.

Overview
The Council on Cybersecurity 20 Critical Security Controls is a 
prioritized list designed to provide maximum benefits toward 
improving risk posture against real-world threats. This list of 20 
control areas grew out of an international consortium of U.S. and 
international agencies and experts, sharing from actual incidents 
and helping to keep it current against evolving global cybersecu-
rity threats. Led by the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the CIS 
Critical Security Controls (“the Controls”) have been matured by 
an international community of individuals and institutions, and 
were updated in 2015 to version six. For more information please 
refer to the documentation found at http://www.cisecurity.org/
critical-controls.
Many organizations face the challenges and increasing threats 
to their cybersecurity by strategically choosing a security 
controls framework as a reference for initiating, implementing, 
measuring and evaluating their security posture, and managing 
risk. Over the years, many security control frameworks have been 
developed (for example, NIST), with the common goal of offering 
combined knowledge and proven guidance for protecting critical 
assets, infrastructure, and information. Based on the informa- 
tion we have today about attacks and threats, what are the most 
important steps that enterprises should take now to secure 
systems and data? 
The Critical Security Controls are designed to provide organi- 
zations the information necessary to increase their security 
posture in a consistent and ongoing fashion. The Controls  are a 
relatively small number of prioritized, well-vetted, and supported 
set of security actions that organizations can take to assess and 
improve their current security state.
To implement the Controls you must understand what is critical 
to your business, data, systems, networks, and infrastructures, 
and you must consider the adversary actions that could impact 
your ability to be successful in the business or operations.
TOP 5 PRIORITIES
We emphasize the use of the first five 
Controls for every organization. This 
helps establish a foundation of security 
and has the most immediate impact on 
preventing attacks. From this foundation 
organizations can apply other Controls 
as they meet the business need of the 
organization.

Protect Yourself 
Use a modern Internet security solution that includes the 
following capabilities for maximum protection against malicious 
code and other threats:
   T Antivirus (file- and heuristic-based) and behavioral malware 
prevention can prevent unknown malicious threats from 
executing.
   T Bi-directional firewalls will block malware from exploiting 
potentially vulnerable applications and services running on 
your computer.
   T Browser protection will protect against obfuscated 
web-based attacks.
   T Use reputation-based tools that check the reputation and 
trust of a file and website before downloading, and that 
check URL reputations and provide safety ratings for 
websites found through search engines.
   T Consider options for implementing cross-platform parental 
controls, such as Norton Online Family.
Update Regularly 
Keep your system, program, and virus definitions up-to-date; 
always accept updates requested by the vendor. 
Running out-of-date versions can put you at risk from being 
exploited by web-based attacks. Only download updates from 
vendor sites directly. Select automatic updates wherever 
possible.
Be Wary of Scareware Tactics
Versions of software that claim to be free, cracked, or pirated 
can expose you to malware or social engineering attacks that 
attempt to trick you into thinking your computer is infected and 
getting you to pay money to have it removed. 
Use an Effective Password Policy
Ensure that passwords are a mix of letters and numbers, and 
change them often. Passwords should not consist of words from 
the dictionary. Do not use the same password for multiple appli-
cations or websites. 
Use complex passwords (upper/lowercase and punctuation). 
Passphrases and password management apps can help too.
Think Before You Click
Never view, open, or copy email attachments to your desktop or 
execute any email attachment unless you expect it and trust the 
sender. Even when receiving email attachments from trusted 
users, be suspicious. 
   T Be cautious when clicking on URLs in emails or social media 
communications, even when coming from trusted sources 
and friends. Do not blindly click on shortened URLs without 
expanding them first using a preview tool or plugin.
   T Use a web browser plugin or URL reputation site that shows 
the reputation and safety rating of websites before visiting.
   T Be suspicious of search engine results; only click through 
to trusted sources when conducting searches, especially on 
topics that are hot in the media.
   T Be suspicious of warnings that pop up asking you to install 
media players, document viewers, and security updates. 
Only download software directly from the vendor’s website.
   T Be aware of files you make available for sharing on public 
sites, including gaming, BitTorrent, and any other peer-to- 
peer (P2P) exchanges. Keep Dropbox, Evernote, and other 
usages to a minimum for pertinent information only, and 
only use when approved for corporate use.
Safeguard Your Personal Data
Limit the amount of personal information you make publicly 
available on the Internet (in particular via social networks). 
This includes personal and financial information, such as bank 
logins or birth dates. Additionally:
   T Regularly review your bank, credit card, and credit informa-
tion frequently for irregular activity.
   T Avoid banking or shopping online from public computers 
(such as libraries, Internet cafes, and similar establish-
ments) or from unencrypted.
Wi-Fi Connections
When using public wireless hotspots consider the following:
   T Use HTTPS when connecting via Wi-Fi networks to your 
email, social media, and sharing websites. Check the 
settings and preferences of the applications and websites 
you are using.
   T Look for the green browser address bar, HTTPS, and recog-
nizable trust marks when you visit websites where you log 
in or share any personal information.
   T  Configure your home Wi-Fi network for strong authentica-
tion and always require a unique password for access to it
