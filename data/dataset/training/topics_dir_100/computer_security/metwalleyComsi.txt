COVER FEATURE COMMUNICATIONS AND PRIVACY UNDER SURVEILLANCE
Using Passive
Measurements to 
Demystify Online Trackers
Hassan Metwalley, Stefano Traverso, and Marco Mellia, Politecnico di Torino 
The Internet revolution has led to the rise of 
trackers—online tracking services that shadow users’ 
browsing activity. Despite trackers’ pervasiveness, 
few users install privacy-enhancing plug-ins.
The Internet has revolutionized our lives, allow-ing us to stay informed, shop, enjoy shows, play games, socialize, and freely express our opinions. Unsurprisingly, the Web advertise-
ment market has grown tremendously, consistently 
surpassing TV broadcast revenues since 2005.1 Online 
advertising lets companies tailor campaigns to specific 
user groups based on knowledge of their interests and 
tastes. This has led to the rapid rise of another type of 
business: online tracking services. Hundreds of track-
ers—usually third parties—populate the modern Web, 
tracking users’ online activity and using the informa-
tion to create per-user profiles. These profiles are made 
available to advertisers, who build ad campaigns or 
offer customers personalized shopping and entertain-
ment suggestions.
Trackers use various techniques to shadow users’ 
browsing activity, including IP addresses, cookies, 
JavaScript code injected in webpages, and fingerprint-
ing that uniquely identifies users’ browsers.2–4 Profiles 
are easily built by following users across different web-
sites for extended periods of time. The tracker business 
model varies greatly: some manage ads directly, some 
provide information to website owners and designers, 
and some act as data brokers by selling personal pro-
files to third parties. Thousands of companies—the 
majority of which are unknown and whose business 
is unclear—have built their businesses around this 
tracked information.
On one hand, online user profiling can benefit both 
companies and consumers. On the other, it raises many 
privacy concerns. Users are becoming increasingly con-
scious of Internet privacy violations, and regulators are 
beginning to take a more active role in protecting users’ 
privacy online. In Europe, for instance, the ePrivacy 
Directive mandates prior consent to inform users if a 
website uses third-party elements.5
To quantify online tracking’s pervasiveness and 
extensiveness, our study used passive  measurements—
which offer the major advantage of naturally factoring 
in users—instead of the more commonly used active 
measurements.6–8 We hope our study increases users’, 
researchers’, and regulators’ awareness of Internet privacy 
and stimulates initiatives to regulate tracking practices.

OUR STUDY
This work builds on our previous 
tracking study.9 For this new study, 
we collected anonymized traces by 
employing Tstat (http://tstat.polito 
.it), a traffic-sniffing probe that pas-
sively observes users as they access 
the Web from their homes. We gener-
ated three datasets: traces collected 
on 9–11 July 2013, 8–10 July 2014, and 
7–9 July 2015. Each dataset aggre-
gated the traffic of 9,500 active users, 
who contacted a total of 53,000 dis-
tinct service hostnames per day. In 
all, we analyzed nearly 260 million 
TCP flow summaries. Despite their 
finitude and locality, these data-
sets let us compare our results with 
those of other studies built on older, 
smaller datasets collected across dif-
ferent scenarios.10,11
Identifying active users and 
number of connected devices
The client Internet Protocol (IP) 
address that the probe sees refers to 
the access gateway (asymmetric dig-
ital subscriber line/fiber to the home) 
that the ISP gives customers. As such, 
the IP address identifies the household, 
where several actual devices and appli-
cations might connect to the Internet 
using Wi-Fi or Ethernet LANs via the 
network address translator (NAT) pro-
vided by the access gateway. In some 
cases, connected devices might gen-
erate traffic without any actual users. 
For instance, the access gateway also 
acts as a voice over IP (VoIP) gateway, 
so we expected some households to 
appear active (the IP address gener-
ated traffic) even if no user was pres-
ent. To filter out traffic sources such as 
smart TVs, VoIP gateways, pure peer-
to-peer clients, and users who gener-
ated minimal Web traffic, we defined 
a household as active if it had at least 
one HTTPS flow and at least 300 HTTP 
or HTTPS total flows over the three 
study days.
To detect multiple devices hidden 
behind the home gateway NAT, we 
used the User-Agents Python module, 
which parses the user-agent field in 
HTTP requests to identify the device, 
OS, version, and browser (for exam-
ple, Google Chrome on OS X v10.10 on 
a Samsung Galaxy S5). The number of 
unique user agents per household esti-
mated the number of multiple devices 
or applications that household used.
We found that approximately 
70 percent of households had 2–10 
devices, with 2 percent having more 
than 20 devices. Smartphones and tab-
lets were especially popular, with mul-
tiple browsers often being used on the 
same device. We dealt with anomalous 
cases and outliers before performing 
our analysis; for example, we identi-
fied users affected by malware that 
generated many HTTP requests to only 
a few ad servers.
Identifying online 
tracking services
We merged a list of trackers from var-
ious sources. We then extracted a list 
of trackers from the Ghostery plug-in, 
which allows users to control how they 
are tracked online, and augmented 
it with a list from the online privacy 
company Abine. The Abine list specifi- 
cally included hostnames for mobile- 
client trackers. Finally, we included 
trackers identified by a procedure we 
described in a previous study.12 To 
simplify matching, we extracted the 
second-level domain name. For in- 
stance, from cnt2.acmetracksyou.com 
and srv1.acmetracksyou.com, we con-
sidered only “acmetracksyou.” This 
improves matching accuracy because 
some trackers use multiple names that 
the Ghostery list might not contain 
but which match the second-level 
domain name.
The final list contained 2,450 dis-
tinct trackers. We included only those 
services that collected users’ infor-
mation by, for example, profiling 
them (scorecardresearch) or tracking 
when they were on a website (google- 
analytics) or an ad server (adnxs). We 
did not consider social network but-
tons and plug-ins.
RESULTS
The results described here confirm the 
ubiquity of online tracking services.
Penetration of trackers
First, we measured the penetration 
of each tracker on our list for the July 
2015 trace. We computed this met-
ric as the percentage of users who 
contacted a given tracker at least 
once with respect to active users. 
The results are impressive: the 
SOME USERS, DESPITE HAVING 
INSTALLED ANTITRACKING PLUG-INS, 
EXCHANGED MORE THAN 50 PERCENT 
OF FLOWS WITH TRACKERS.

COMMUNICATIONS AND PRIVACY UNDER SURVEILLANCE
top trackers— doubleclick, google- 
analytics, and googlesyndication— 
were contacted by 98.8, 98.7, and 97.4 
of active users, respectively. We then 
analyzed the evolution of the 20 most 
pervasive trackers over the last three 
years (see Figure 1). The names of the 
tracking services were mostly unfa-
miliar, even to expert Internauts.
Overall, 800 of the 2,450 trackers 
were contacted by at least one user. 
Clearly, the set of contacted trackers 
changed according to the users’ country, 
but the fact that several hundred track-
ers might be encountered during Web 
browsing is impressive nevertheless.
Figure 1 shows marginal changes 
over time, reflecting the extent to 
which the top trackers have saturated 
the market. Most trackers showed 
increased penetration over the three 
years. For instance, googletagmanager 
tripled its coverage. Some new players 
appeared as well, such as ads.yahoo. 
Notably, no top services went out of 
business or disappeared.
We were also interested in how 
many TCP flows users exchanged 
with the top trackers, and how many 
of these flows used HTTPS. We found 
that trackers used encryption to col-
lect users’ information, some doubling 
or even tripling their HTTPS usage in 
2015 compared to 2014. Nearly all the 
top 20 trackers had increased their 
HTTPS usage over the three years by 
more than 400 percent. For instance, 
in 2015, googleadservices, doubleclick, 
and serving-sys encrypted 55, 52, and 
46 percent of their flows, respectively 
(compared to 18, 10, and 12 percent in 
2013). This upsurge was also likely due 
to the increase in HTTPS- enabled web-
sites that enforce HTTPS for all third-
party content.
Finally, we measured the number of 
trackers contacted by active users (see 
Figure 2). Only the most active users 
contacted more than 300 trackers 
during the three-day trace. Interest-
ingly, nearly 40 percent of active users 
contacted at least 100 different track-
ers. Only 73 active users—1 percent—
never contacted any trackers.
Popularity and efficacy 
of antitracking plug-ins
We evaluated how effectively anti-
tracking plug-ins such as Adblock Plus, 
AdBlock, Blur, Ghostery, and Web of 
Trust reduced the amount of informa-
tion sent to trackers. Using the 2015 
trace, we split users into two groups: 
those who ran an antitracking plug-in 
with at least one device, and those who 
did not run an antitracking plug-in. 
(We identified users running such 
plug-ins by checking whether they 
contacted the corresponding service 
update server.9) Just over 12 percent of 
households used antitracking plug-ins.
For each user, we computed the 
fraction of data exchanged with track-
ing servers with respect to all data 
exchanged with all Web services (see 
Figure 3). Notice that for some users, a 
significant fraction of the traffic they 
generated was exchanged with track-
ers. For instance, 50 percent of the

users without antitracking plug-ins 
exchanged more than 10 percent of 
their data with trackers. Moreover, Fig-
ure 3 confirms that users who installed 
antitracking plug-ins exchanged less 
data with trackers. However, the dif-
ference between the two curves was 
smaller than we expected. On further 
investigation, we found that most anti-
tracking plug-ins are available only for 
PC browsers, leaving mobile devices 
unprotected against trackers.
To complement these findings, we 
computed the percentage of flows 
exchanged with trackers over the total 
number of generated flows (see Figure 
4). Several observations hold. First, 
and unsurprisingly, the more active a 
user, the more likely he or she was to 
contact trackers. Second, users who 
had installed antitracking plug-ins 
were the most active. Third, the frac-
tion of flows exchanged with trackers 
was also large for users with antitrack-
ing plug-ins. Some users, despite hav-
ing installed antitracking plug-ins, 
exchanged more than 50 percent of 
flows with trackers. Manual inspection 
revealed that these were mostly users 
who browsed a large number of news 
portals on tablets and smartphones, 
which often embed many trackers.
Pervasiveness of trackers
Finally, to measure trackers’ perva-
siveness among different Web services, 
we examined the HTTP summaries 
that the probe produced. For each URL 
whose hostname was a third-party 
tracker, we checked the referer field 
for the first-party service that embed-
ded it. One-third of the  services—
more than 44,500—hosted at least 
one tracker. We then determined 
each service’s popularity (that is, how 
many users contacted it) and how 
many trackers it embedded (see Figure 
5). The scenario was rather hetero- 
geneous. Some services were unpopu-
lar (for example, contacted by only one 
or two users) yet hosted many track-
ers, and some were popular yet hosted 
few trackers (see, for example, the 
bottom- right corner of Figure 5). Mul-
tiple trackers might be embedded in a 
single website because website owners 
commonly offer ad space to mediator 
companies. Each time the webpage is 
accessed, the mediator company runs a 
background auction, selling the space 
to possible advertisers in real time. 
The winning advertiser then embeds 
ads on the webpage, resulting in a 
third-party tracker. Thus, more page 
visits lead to more spaces being offered 
to more auction competitors and, ulti-
mately, many distinct trackers being 
embedded within the website.13
In general, the number of trackers 
per service tended to increase with 
service popularity. The blue curve in 
Figure 5 reports the average number 
of trackers for every subset of 100 ser-
vices grouped by popularity. The more 
popular a site was, the higher its aver-
age number of embedded trackers.

recent years (see Table 1). For our study, 
we were most interested in each solu-
tion’s compatibility with mobile termi-
nals, capacity to monitor traffic gener-
ated by user devices, and capacity to 
handle content carried in encrypted 
HTTP channels. This last character-
istic is particularly significant if the 
tracker uses a seemingly legitimate 
domain name but actually delivers 
content that contains tracking code— 
for example, Facebook and its social 
sharing buttons.
On-device solutions
One way users can limit communication 
with trackers is by installing software on 
their devices, such as browser plug-ins 
that check and filter the traffic uniquely 
generated inside the browser. The most 
notable antitracking browser plug-ins 
are Ghostery and the Electronic Fron-
tier Foundation’s Privacy Badger. Other 
popular plug-ins, such as Adblock Plus, 
do not explicitly protect personal infor-
mation, but partially achieve this goal 
by blocking online ad services. How-
ever, these solutions are limited. First, 
they only control transactions estab-
lished by the browser and cannot see 
traffic generated by other applications 
on the device. Second, they are often 
unavailable for mobile devices or, when 
available, are stand-alone browsers (for 
example, Ghostery) or content-blocking 
policies that apply to browsers only (for 
example, iOS/Safari).
Another on-device solution is to 
install tools like AdGuard, PrivDog, and 
AdFender that work as local proxies. 
These tools intercept all HTTP trans-
actions generated by applications, not 
just those from the browser. However, 
they often cannot inspect HTTPS traffic 
(that is, encrypted HTTP transactions) 
and are unavailable for mobile devices.
In general, only a few on-device 
tools are open source and allow users 
to customize functionalities.
In-network solutions
Firewalls, proxies (Privoxy, SafeSquid), 
and DNS resolvers (OpenDNS)—which 
are typically installed in the network’s 
demilitarized zones to process net-
work device traffic—can be used to 
block tracker connections. However, 
because they work at either the TCP/IP 
or DNS level, they cannot inspect traf-
fic when encryption is enabled. The 
only way to overcome this would be 
through intrusive man-in-the- middle 
solutions. DNS-based antitracking 
solutions build on lists of domains, 
thus blocking with very poor granular-
ity. Finally, because they are installed 
in the network and centralized, these 
solutions lack scalability and custom-
ization options.
Overall, there is no comprehen-
sive solution capable of completely

limiting communications with track-
ers. However, broader proposals in the 
literature to increase Internet trans-
parency might help address antitrack-
ing solutions.14 
The intrusiveness of trackers is astonishing: the top 100 track-ers in our study regularly collect 
information from 40 percent of users—
with some tracking 98 percent— and 
are embedded in more than 70 percent 
of websites. Trackers are also increas-
ingly embracing HTTPS, making it 
more difficult to regulate the informa-
tion they collect.
We hope that our work will not only 
increase users’ consciousness of the 
fragility of their online privacy but 
also stimulate design solutions that 
let users control the information they 
exchange with the Internet.
