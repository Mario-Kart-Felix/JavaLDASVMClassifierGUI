The Internet has moved beyond an educational and research tool that served as a social network for a few elite 
scientists and has been transformed into a commerce and health care juggernaut accessible to much of the 
planet. However, the accessibility of this resource has not been unencumbered by complication and challenge. 
Internet pharmacies demonstrated potential early on as a hub within a wider set of eHealth services, 
but has since been mired in doubts regarding transparency, fraud, product quality, and even its viability 
as an ethical business model. Even now, over a decade after the first Internet pharmacies, questions 
of legality and policy plague this venture. It is telling that among the total responding countries to this 
survey (114), most Member States (66%) remain uncommitted on this issue, unable to decide whether 
Internet pharmacies should be prohibited or allowed. And while those among World Bank categorized 
upper-middle and high-income countries are most likely to have addressed this issue, overall there is still 
more prohibition (19%) than permission (7%) of Internet pharmacy operations.
Internet security, in the form of spam, is another persistent challenge. Crime follows opportunity and the 
first spam actually appeared in 1978, shortly after the Internet itself had been opened to the public. Spam 
itself poses a risk for individuals and institutions, but its greater threat may be as a vehicle for fraud, viruses, 
malware, and spyware. Spam has also been used to target vulnerable populations suffering from poorly 
treated or socially stigmatized medical conditions. Overall, technology filters remain the most common 
tool employed to combat spam. E-mail filters are used by Member States at both the local organizational/
business (75%) and Internet service provider (67%) levels. A combination of legislative (33%) and educational 
(30%) responses also remain staples in attempting to reduce spam by responding countries, although 
these are most likely to occur in high-income countries, at rates of 55% and 52% respectively.

The Internet presents a world of opportunities for children and adolescents, but it also threatens 
communities with inappropriate content, cyberbullying among peers, and online predators – whether 
that is via connection to the Internet at home, in a cybercafé, or by Smartphone. To date, of those 
Member States that have some type of government-sponsored initiative on Internet safety (47%), the 
vast majority also specifically direct efforts at protecting children (93%). However, there is much room 
for growth as less than a quarter (22%) of responding countries legally require the use of “safety tools” in 
locations children are known to frequent (e.g. libraries and schools) in more developed countries.
For one of the most daunting challenges associated with the Internet and health care, assurance of 
online health information quality, the most common approach (55%) was voluntary compliance by 
content providers and web site owners. All the other measures to assure quality information online 
(e.g. education programmes, government intervention, official seals of approval) were used by less 
than one third of Member States.
To address unresolved issues with Internet pharmacies, Member States should consider regulation 
to protect public health and, when feasible, create an alternative, but secure distribution channel for 
delivery of essential medicines. Member States with existing legislation identified in this volume can 
be a valuable point of contact and data for other countries wishing to move forward in this arena. 
Organizations and institutions including the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) also merit 
consulting based on their work in these areas. 
Distribution and receipt of spam should be targeted based on the findings in this volume including 
continued international support of non-profit-making efforts (e.g. Spamhaus) as well as consolidation 
of fragmented educational efforts. Stronger definitions, penalties, and enforcement should also be 
established for spam when possible. Additionally, findings suggest reallocating existing resources – 
currently diluted in multiple ways – to educational programmes for citizens to help avoid the more serious 
threats that can accompany spam (e.g. viruses).
While security issues such as spam create problems costing billions in any currency, the most polarizing 
public health threat presented by the Internet may be to the safety of children and adolescents. For those 
Member States contemplating introduction and prioritization, or strengthening legislation for online 
child safety, libraries, schools, and community centres granting Internet access to children and teenagers 
are natural foci for directing legislative and intervention efforts. 
Moving into the next decade, Internet safety and literacy present enormous challenges, as basic and 
health literacy are still hurdles to be overcome in most Member States. Developing countries and those 
with low initiative rates should consider emphasizing this area; lower rates of Internet penetration 
have insulated youth in developing countries to date, but with the explosion of Internet accessibility via 
mobile devices the face of Internet access has changed. Formalizing or codifying educational practices 
to integrate digital literacy and awareness of online safety issues into requisite schooling and adult 
education would be beneficial.

The capacity for digital literacy is intertwined with accessibility to and quality of online health information. 
It is anticipated that the importance of these issues will become even more prominent in the coming 
years. Solutions for managing the quality of health information proposed included use of medically 
focused search engines as well as official seals of approval (e.g. HONcode). While those tools have utility, 
stakeholders are seeking a more holistic approach being developed and implemented globally: stricter 
guidelines and regulations on health content, and more abiding codes of ethics and content provider 
accountability. One approach that is taking these factors into consideration is that of the proposed dot 
health top-level domain (TLD). A dot health TLD could serve as an organizational indicator for quality 
health information sources on the Internet; hence it could then act as a global resource to address many 
of the related eHealth issues raised here.
The results of this survey indicate a need for action and progress across the eHealth spectrum. However, 
case studies illustrating successes with Internet pharmacies along with citizen- and institution-initiated 
methods of addressing online health information quality are provided in the text of the report; these could 
be considered examples of a foundation on which to build upon. Similarly, World Health Organization 
(WHO) conclusions regarding approaches to navigate obstacles detailed in the report as well as measures 
to build on existing initiatives are included in the discussion.

The Internet, which began as a government-funded initiative, has spread throughout the world at a 
remarkable rate during the 1990s and 2000s. This transition of the Internet from a curiosity among a 
few academics to permeating nearly all facets of personal and professional life has been described as 
revolutionary by technology experts and media alike (1). While just 3 million people had access to the 
Internet in 1990 (73% of which lived in the United States of America and 15% in western Europe; 2), there 
are now nearly 2 billion people connected to the Internet worldwide (Table 1; 3).

The scope of the Internet has changed drastically during this period as well. In its infancy, the Internet was 
limited to research, education and government uses; commercial use was barred until the early 1990s 
unless it directly served research or education goals. In its current incarnation, the Internet has developed 
vast commercial potential. Worldwide e-commerce sales are predicted to reach US$ 963 billion by 2013, 
averaging growth of 19.4% a year (4). 
While the evolution of the Internet away from being a tightly controlled, research-based medium has 
produced great potential for mass communication, commerce and information sharing, this growth 
comes at a price. Misinformation on the Internet is rife. Phishing1 scams using e-mail to steal information 
and identities carry a tremendous cost (e.g. £1.7 billion annually in the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland alone) (5). Some Internet pharmacies sell potentially addictive substances without 
a prescription, as well as dangerous counterfeit medications. Children and teenagers are groomed and 
lured by predators into abusive situations.
Because of the lack of systematic research into the use of information and communication technologies 
(ICT) for health, the World Health Organization’s Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) conducted 
a survey of Member State’s eHealth practices in 2005. This was followed by a more detailed survey in 
2009 (the methodology of which is explained in Appendix 1). This report focuses on Internet pharmacies, 
Internet security, online safety of children and adolescents, and digital literacy and online health 
information quality. It begins by providing an overview of these four topics, as well as an evaluation of 
the available literature. The results of the corresponding sections of the second global eHealth survey are 
then analysed and discussed, highlighting key findings. These results are given a deeper context through 
a series of case studies, before the remaining unanswered questions and future directions for Internet 
pharmacies, online health information, and cross-border regulation are discussed. 
1 1  Internet pharmacies
Pharmacies as commercial enterprises began to appear in Europe during the Middle Ages. Pharmacy’s 
modern era has witnessed its development largely in western European countries with the aid of strong, 
centralized, mandatory government controls and occurred as a discrete system separate from medical 
practice (6). In countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the line between pharmacy 
and medical practice was much less distinct. 
For centuries, the brick-and-mortar approach to selling pharmaceuticals served as the template around 
the world. However, in the late 1870s, pharmacies began selling prescription medications via mail order 
in the United States. More than 120 years later, this mail-order tradition would underpin the formation 
of the first Internet-based pharmacy, Soma.com, in January 1999. A few months later, the first Internet 
pharmacy launched in the United Kingdom (7). By the end of 1999, a staggering 400 web sites were selling 
medications. And by early 2004, this number was estimated at more than 1000 (8). Shortly following the 
launch of these first Internet pharmacies, the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the possible 
risks to individuals and the public health if medical products were sold via online means in a manner that

but are designed to steal your identity.

could bypass legislative measures that had been introduced to assure consumer safety (9). Currently it is 
unknown how many pharmacies are doing business over the Internet, but estimates of the industry range 
from US$ 50 to 75 billion (10; 11). 
Globally, Member States’ national pharmacy organizations are connected by the International 
Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP2) (12). The FIP and its member associations have developed a dialogue 
with WHO, evidenced in efforts such as the WHO/FIP Joint Declaration on the Role of the Pharmacist in 
the Fight Against the HIV-AIDS Pandemic, Good Pharmacy Practice guidelines, and involvement in the 
International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT) coalition.
In 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed that examined 275 English-language web sites located 
using the search engines Google and AltaVista with the keywords “prescription drugs” (13). Based on their 
investigation, the authors grouped Internet pharmacies selling prescription medications into four distinct 
categories (Table 2). 
Table 2. Models of Internet pharmacies
Source: (13).
These categories of Internet pharmacies speak to the fact that when compared with traditional 
pharmacies, buying prescription medications online is truly a matter of caveat emptor.

Pharmacy category Operational approach
Legitimate
Provide medications as extension of established brick-and-mortar 
pharmacy, contingent upon patient possession of a valid medical 
prescription.
Subscription
Advertise online access to pharmacies selling prescription-only 
drugs without a prescription in return for a subscription fee paid 
online with a credit card.
Lifestyle
Supply ‘lifestyle drugs’ (e.g. erectile dysfunction, obesity, or male 
pattern baldness) directly to the patient after being issued a 
prescription through an ‘online consultation’.
No-prescription
Offer mail-order delivery of drugs such as opioids, 
benzodiazepines and methylphenidate without a prescription in 
return for online credit card payment.

1 2 Internet security
With the growth of global e-commerce, an ever-increasing number of people are becoming more 
comfortable with making monetary transactions online. This has naturally led to the expansion of online 
criminal activity, or cybercrime. Cybercrime began as a job perpetrated by those with functional inside 
knowledge of businesses but has transformed into an anonymous attack often backed by organized 
crime. There are a number of different means for cybercriminals to perpetuate their agendas, including 
spam, malware and phishing scams. Selected examples are described hereafter.
Spam
The term ‘spam’ describes unsolicited electronic messages sent in bulk (14). Spam is most frequently seen as 
e-mail but is increasingly being employed via short message service (SMS) or text message, computer instant 
message (IM), and by telephone. Spam e-mails often direct the recipient to an external web site, but it can as 
serve as a vehicle for malware dissemination or phishing scams (see following sections). In this manner, spam 
is also increasingly used as a tool of the aforementioned no-prescription or ‘rogue’ pharmacies.
Spam is very common. MessageLabs Intelligence recently reported a global ratio of spam in e-mail traffic 
of 75.8%, which corresponds to one in every 1.32 e-mails received (15). As spam levels increased by 2.9 
percentage points over the previous month, the Russian Federation became the most spammed country 
in the world, with a spam rate of 82% (Table 3).

Introduction

Spam messages are an inefficient, but low-risk means for perpetuating cybercrime. A study of spamming 
conducted in 2008 calculated that spammers only receive one response for every 12.5 million e-mails 
they send (16). Despite this low response rate, spammers are still able to generate a profit, albeit not 
the millions of US dollars assumed in some circles. This profit may be due, in part, to identity theft and a 
more targeted use of spam in which certain consumer groups (e.g. those suffering from poorly managed 
medical diseases or conditions with a social element like obesity) are more likely to receive, open, and 
purchase items from spam e-mails (17).
Pharmaceutical spam, as a subset of spam, is very common. In fact, Internet security experts estimate that 
over 65% of all spam is “Pharmaceutical spam” (18). The most common brands featured in pharmaceutical 
spam is the “Canadian Pharmacy”; however, other similar web sites such as the “United Pharmacy,” or 
the “Indian Pharmacy” are appearing more frequently (18). 
One of the most coordinated attempts to combat spam to date is the Spamhaus Project. Spamhaus 
is an international non-profit-making organization based in Geneva, Switzerland and London, United 
Kingdom and maintains numerous spam blocking databases as well as publishing the Register of Known 
Spam Operations (ROKSO).3 Spamhaus also works with various cybercrimes units and law enforcement 
including Scotland Yard Computer Crime Unit (United Kingdom), Independent Authority of Posts and 
Telecommunications (Netherlands), Australia Communication and Media Authority, and the National 
Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance (United States). Notably, Spamhaus has received a number of 
accolades in support of their efforts by both governmental agencies (e.g. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
FBI, in the United States), and media (e.g. Virus Bulletin Award for the greatest contribution to combating 
spam in the past 10 years).

Viruses and malware
Malware is the term for the “broad range of software” with “malicious or fraudulent intent” (19). Examples 
of malware include computer viruses, dishonest adware, spyware, scareware,4 Trojan horses, and worms. 
In a recent report, MessageLabs Intelligence calculated that one in every 290.1 e-mails worldwide 
contained some form of malware (20). The highest levels of malware were detected in South Africa, with 
one in every 81.8 e-mails containing malware; additional country information can be found in Table 4.
Table 4. Malware rates by country
Source: (20).
Perhaps most notably, portable document format (PDF) file attachments are now the attack vector of 
choice for targeted attacks, with their usage increasing 12.4% between 2009 and 2010 (20). Cybercriminals 
are taking advantage of the fact that PDFs are one of the most common ways to share electronic 
documents and the majority of people consider PDFs to be a trusted file type. However, it is exceptionally 
easy to conceal malicious programs in PDF files.
These malicious programs could be spyware, which monitors the user while he/she is browsing the 
Internet in order to display advertisements or redirect marketing revenues to the spyware’s creator. 
Spyware can also be used to steal private data like passwords, medical insurance information, or credit 
card and bank account numbers, resulting in theft and fraud. In 2010 more than 100 cybercriminals and 
money mules were arrested for stealing US$ 70 million from bank accounts using the crimeware toolkit 
named ‘Zeus’ (21). Similarly, complete medical identity theft is increasing at alarming rates (22) and 
spyware and phishing can accelerate that process, especially as more patient data is digitally housed 
in open-system electronic health records and personal health records. This development prompted 
the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) for Health Information Technology in the United States 
to release a report in 2009 that included a provision for the role of health information technology in 
helping combat medical identity theft (23).

Introduction
15
Internet users in developing countries are particularly susceptible to viruses and other malware because 
licences for operating systems (OS) and antivirus software are simply unaffordable. Vulnerability may 
be further exacerbated due to a culture of piracy and a general lack of network security. Based on the 
Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) Task Force on Spam findings, the 
combination of a basic Windows OS and antivirus program can cost the equivalent of a month’s salary 
in developing economies (24). Consequently, a high percentage of computer owners purchase cheaper 
(and more often than not, pirated) versions of software and operating systems that not only leaves their 
machines vulnerable because they are nearly impossible to update, but also because they are, themselves, 
another likely source of viruses.
Phishing scams
Phishing scams involve e-mail messages that falsely claim to be from an established, legitimate business 
or organization but are designed to steal your identity. These e-mails either ask the recipient to send their 
private information, such as passwords, bank account numbers, medical insurance registry numbers, and 
credit card details, via e-mail or direct the recipient to a web site where they are duped into providing 
these data. Just like a fisherman, the cybercriminals throw out their e-mails like bait, knowing that while 
most will ignore their message, some will be tricked into biting.
Rogue Internet pharmacies are often used as an online front for phishing scams. The web site provides 
a convincing ‘storefront’ that purports to sell a range of lifestyle drugs; however, after placing an order 
the cybercriminals take the buyer’s money and credit card details without ever intending to fill the order.
Phishing has progressed to the point that 1 in every 216.7 e-mails could be linked to a phishing scam (20). 
South Africa was the most targeted country with phishing levels calculated at one in 32.5 e-mails (Table 5).

As with all e-mail-mediated cybercrime, the most effective means of protection is awareness and caution, 
as the recipient is the last line of defence.
1 3 Online safety of children and adolescents
Adults are increasingly spending their discretionary time on the Internet, and children and adolescents 
”spend more time with media than they do in any other activity except for sleeping” (25). However, because 
of the easy and often private access to children that the Internet offers, it has provided a new medium 
through which child exploitation, child maltreatment, and sexual and emotional abuse can propagate 
(26). Broadly speaking, the Internet gives child predators instant access to a large group of potential 
victims, as well as the opportunity to create their own ‘communities’ to exchange ideas and reinforce 
their prurient desires.
Unsupervised access to children and teens
When it comes to finding and luring potential victims, the Internet provides numerous opportunities and 
advantages for predators. Chat rooms, role playing games (e.g. World of Warcraft), virtual worlds (e.g. Second 
Life), and social networking sites (e.g. Facebook), facilitate predators’ agendas by allowing participants to remain 
anonymous or create false identities. By disguising their true identity and motives, predators are able to build 
long-term online relationships with their targeted victims prior to any attempt to promote physical contact.
More recently, varying forms of harassment have become a more prominent issue for children and teens. 
Examples include students in New Zealand who were recipients of bullying by text and were significantly 
more likely to feel unsafe at school (27), the link between online and offline stalking of teens in Canada 
(28), and cyberbullying5 beginning in middle school (30). 
1 4 Digital literacy and online health information quality
Prior to the 21st century, literacy was simply defined as a person’s ability to read and write; today, with 
the advance of modern technology and the advent of the Internet, the concept of literacy has taken on 
a broader meaning (31). In this new era, literacy encompasses a person’s ability to effectively perform 
tasks in a digital medium, understand and use information gathered from a variety of digital sources, and 
evaluate the new knowledge gleaned from digital environments (32). The ability to critically evaluate 
information retrieved online is an integral part of the concept of digital literacy. Going forward, the 
related concept of eHealth literacy will also be of growing importance as individuals work to achieve 
competency in and reconcile computer literacy, health information literacy (33), and media literacy (34).
5  “The harassment of one party by another, by means of the Internet or any electronic device” (29).
Introduction
17
While the Internet provides practically unlimited potential for acquiring new knowledge, rash, 
unconsidered acceptance of its content can mislead. Therefore, one cannot be considered digitally 
literate until he/she has the ability to judge the reliability of online information (32; 34). Unfortunately, 
critical evaluation of online information is generally lacking in society. A pair of studies conducted five 
years apart by the Open University in Israel detected that the “information and literature reproduction” 
subset of digital literacy skills actually suffered decline over time demonstrating potentially flawed 
assumptions about increasing abilities of digital natives and others (35). Similarly, a study of university 
students (n=1914) in the United States found that a quarter of all students were unable to use similar cues 
to detect multiple signs of danger associated with rogue Internet pharmacies (36). This lack of critical 
thinking and analysis is particularly worrying in the context of health information found on the Internet.
Accuracy and reliability of online health information
Searching for health information online is among the most commonly performed Internet activities; 
recent estimates suggest approximately 8 out of every 10 adults who have online access do so in the 
United States (37, 38), European countries (39), as well as India, China, Russia, Brazil, and Mexico (40). 
However, according to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, only 15% of online health 
information seekers said they “always” checked the source and the publication date of the information 
they found online (41). This means that nearly 115 million Americans are gathering health information 
online without evaluating its quality. Not all of the blame for diminished quality control mechanisms can 
be put on patients, however. A study conducted under the direction of the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services calculated that only 4% of the most frequently visited health web sites published the 
source of their content and just 2% revealed how the content was updated (42). 
These practices are worrying because patients use the information they find online to make health-
related decisions. In a 2010 survey by Fox and Purcell (43), 53% of American respondents stated that their 
last Internet search impacted their personal health care in some way or the way they cared for someone 
else. Further, one third of e-Patients reported that what they found online specifically affected their 
decision whether or not to see a doctor. A study conducted at an outpatient clinic in India similarly found 
that respondents reported that information found on the Internet prompted them to ask their physicians 
questions (62%) and some to even seek a second opinion (28%) (44).
Separately, it has been reported that one in every two people searching for health information online 
do so to self-diagnose, with the highest rates of this practice occurring in Russia, the United States, the 
United Kingdom, and Australia (40, 45). However, many other patients use online health information to 
determine treatment options.

Case study 1  Foundation in Switzerland helps citizens 
determine trustworthiness of online health information 
As members of the public increasingly gravitate to the Internet to seek guidance or find answers to their 
questions about health, disease, and treatment options, the quality of the information they locate online 
becomes paramount. To this end, the Health On the Net Foundation (HON) aims to “help unify and standardize 
the quality of medical and health information” that can be found online (46). In 1995, HON was born out of 
a meeting of experts at a conference in Geneva, Switzerland and is a nongovernmental organization (NGO). 
The following year, HON launched operations to implement its Code of Conduct (HONcode).
The HONcode was created to benefit the public, health-care professionals, and web publishers. The 
presence of the HONcode logo signifies to patients and providers that the site adheres to certain 
principles and has undergone HON’s certification process. The eight principles governing the HONcode 
are: authority; complementarity; confidentiality; attribution; justifiability; transparency; financial 
disclosure; and advertising.
The actual certification process is voluntary and conducted by a HON 
review committee. Those sites satisfying the eight principles are given the 
HONcode seal, which links back to a certificate on HON’s web site detailing 
the performance. From that point on, monitoring of the site is periodic and 
begins one year after initial certification. 
Since its initial formation, HONcode has been used by over 100 countries and 
covers 10 million web pages (47). HON has also entered into partnerships 
with government agencies such as the French National Authority for Health 
(Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS), which resulted in improvements in web 
sites in France (48). 
In the beginning, HON’s strategy and vision in improving the quality of medical and health 
information on the web was not well-known. In 2004, the European Commission and the European 
Union recognized Health On the Net Foundation’s activities and services supporting the quality 
of health information at a multilingual level with an award, the Europe Award for eHealth. This 
distinguished award has given legitimacy to HON and visibility to its actions … 
Thanks to the introduction of the EU quality criteria developed in 2002, to which HON contributed, 
the HONcode has been recognised and become the first organization implementing the quality 
standards set by the EU (49).
—Celia Boyer, Executive Director, Health On the Net Foundation
New resources have been formulated by the Foundation such as the HONcode Toolbar, which acts as a 
plug-in for Internet browsers to check the web site that is being visited. If the site status is compliant with 
the HONcode, the Toolbar displays the seal in colour. Looking ahead, the Foundation also developed eight 
principles for their nascent ‘HONcode Web 2.0’. Web 2.0 or social media are descriptors of the second 
iteration of the web and are characterized by a bidirectional, dynamic web featuring user-generated 
content. Web 2.0 principles include information on sites regarding moderator status, privacy policy, 
documentation of health claims, and advertising policies. 
 
 
Introduction

Online Health Information in developing countries
It has been suggested that citizens in emerging economies like Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Russia 
may have a greater reliance on health information they find online than people in developed nations 
because of the higher costs associated with seeing a medical professional face to face (40, 45). Despite 
this possible demand, people in developing countries face two important disadvantages to accessing 
health information: much of the health content online is based in the United States and written in English; 
and health information in developing nations is often inadequate and unreliable. 
With the exception of www.who.int, the remaining 20 most popular global health sites are based in the 
United States – including the U.S. National Institutes of Health, WebMD, PubMed, Medicinenet.com, Natural 
Health Information Articles and Health Newsletter (mercola.com), Medline Plus, Drugs.com, Medscape, 
and the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s AIDS Patents Database (40, 45) – the highest utilizers 
of these health portals, after Americans, come from India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and China 
respectively. According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, all English-
language health web sites required a reading ability at high school level or better (50). This indicates that 
these sites are only useful resources for people with a relatively strong grasp of the English language.
Further, an investigation of health-related web sites in Sri Lanka found that only 64% were controlled by a 
Sri Lankan or a Sri Lankan organization (51). Overall, 87% of the health-related web sites comprised fewer 
than 100 pages and only 8% contained health education for the general public as their main content. 
The authors concluded that the number of web sites available to Sri Lankans had not increased despite 
significant increases in Internet usage over the previous few years.
Another example comes from Thailand, where the reliability of available online health information has 
been called into question: a study investigating the credibility of 255 health-related web sites found that 
99% of these sites have legal and/or ethical issues, while only 9% provide a disclaimer (52).

Review
 of the literature

2
A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted for each of the four main areas covered in this report 
in order to gain a better understanding of both the risks and benefits found online in the eHealth arena.
2 1 Internet pharmacies
For consumers, there are many perceived benefits of purchasing prescription pharmaceuticals online, 
including lower prices, greater convenience, and avoidance of embarrassment (8). However, there are 
also real health risks associated with Internet pharmacies, especially when purchasing from sites that do 
not require a valid prescription for prescription-only medications (53). Because of these potential threats 
to safety, researchers have started to forecast and evaluate the safety, reliability, and accessibility of 
Internet pharmacies, as well as the impact on consumers and the industry of the prescription medications 
sold via these portals (54).
Methodology
Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EBSCO databases, as well as 
Google Scholar, were searched for the periods January 1999 to March 2011 using search terms including 
‘Internet pharmacy’, ‘online pharmacy’, ‘Internet pharmacy safety’, ‘safety online medic*’,7 ‘safety 
Internet medic*’, ‘online pharmacy safety’, ‘online counterfeit medic*’, ‘Internet counterfeit medic*’, 
and ‘online medic* access’.

The literature search also included a limited search of references retrieved from included articles but did 
not extend to searching Internet web sites, grey literature, conference abstracts, or contacting authors 
for unpublished data. Clinical studies, feasibility studies, survey studies, meta-analyses, and review 
articles published in English and those obtainable in English translation were considered for inclusion 
in this review. Studies discussing policy and/or legal implications for herbal supplements, natural health 
products or ‘legal highs’ were not included for review. Lists of articles were deduplicated.
Safety of medications purchased online: is there cause for 
concern?
Incidents highlighting the dangers of purchasing prescription medications online are widely reported in 
the media of developed countries. Despite concerns about those dangers, consumers are still purchasing 
them in countries such as Hungary (55), Italy (56), Germany (57), and the United States (36). 
However, do data exist to show there are significant risks posed to consumers by Internet pharmacy 
sites? And if so, is this evidence sufficient and compelling enough to warrant the development of a more 
stringent legal framework for Internet pharmacies worldwide? The discussion that follows seeks to 
answer these questions.
Availability of prescription-only drugs and lack of clinical 
oversight
A number of studies have shown that nearly every major category of prescription drug is available 
online without a prescription (58–65). In 2009, French researchers investigated the online availability 
of treatments for psoriasis (62). They discovered that it was a facile process for consumers without 
significant Internet expertise to find Internet pharmacies selling the majority of available treatments 
without requiring a prescription; even the newest and most expensive products (e.g. biological agents) 
were readily available. 
Even more worrisome, other groups of researchers have found it surprisingly easy to purchase the class 
of medications called opioids over the Internet without a prescription (65). Opioids are used medically 
as painkillers, but their use can also lead to dependence and serious side-effects such as respiratory 
depression. In 2006, Forman and colleagues (60) conducted 47 Internet searches for a range of opioids. 
Searches using terms such as “no prescription codeine” and “Vicodin” yielded more than 300 web sites 
offering to sell opioids without a prescription. 
Perhaps one of the easiest drugs to find online without a prescription is the drug sildenafil. While sildenafil 
is used for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) (Revatio®), it is much better known 
for its use to treat erectile dysfunction (Viagra®). In one of the earliest studies looking into the sale of 
Viagra® online, researchers conducted a systematic search of the Internet to identify all sites selling 
Viagra® directly to consumers between 14 April and 28 April 1999. Of 4400 potentially eligible sites 
returned by the search engines, 86 offered to send Viagra directly to the buyer without needing to see a 
doctor. Of these 86 sites, 55% required the customer to complete an online medical questionnaire, 5% 
offered but did not require a questionnaire, and 40% did not offer any type of evaluation (58).
Review
 of the literature
23
The online sale of sildenafil has not changed much in a decade. A more recent study conducted in 2010 
found that 34% of Internet pharmacy sites offered to sell Viagra® to consumers in the United Kingdom 
without any form of medical consultation (61). The researchers were unable to determine whether the 
medical questionnaires offered by 59% of sites were required to be completed prior to purchase.
Medical questionnaires
The validity and reliability of medical questionnaires hosted on Internet pharmacies sites has been called 
into question. Orizio and colleagues (66) conducted a content analysis of online pharmacy medical 
questionnaires to examine their completeness. While nearly all questionnaires (97%) asked if the 
customer had any drug allergies, other types of allergies were only queried by 70%, which was the same 
percentage that asked women if they were pregnant or breastfeeding. Even more telling was the fact 
that only 19% asked the customer if the purchase was based on a medical diagnosis provided by a health-
care professional. According to the authors, these results suggest that medical questionnaires provided 
by online pharmacies exist more as a marketing ploy to convey a sense of security and assurance than to 
accurately assess health status and actual need for the medication (66).
To test whether Internet pharmacies actually use the information provided on health questionnaires to 
control the sale of potentially dangerous medications, Memmel and colleagues (63) posed alternately as 
a “healthy 25-year-old woman”, a “35-year-old woman who was obese and a heavy tobacco user” and a 
“35-year-old smoker on an antihypertensive medication”, and attempted to purchase combination oral 
contraceptives or contraceptive patches without a prescription. Despite entering known risk factors for 
estrogen use on the questionnaires provided by two of the three targeted sites, the researchers were able 
to purchase, and later receive, the desired contraceptives. The investigators also noted that there was no 
medical follow-up to these sales except for offers of additional products (63).
The unfettered availability of prescription medications online poses a significant danger to patients 
as it may increase the risk of side-effects and adverse reactions by not accounting for potential 
contraindications or drug-drug interactions or by delaying treatment (8, 58, 67). The ease with which 
individuals are able to purchase controlled substances without a valid prescription also suggests there is 
ample opportunity for prescription drug abuse (59).
Bate and Hess (59) reported that even when ordering from Internet pharmacies requiring prescriptions, 
the process was still under-scrutinized. The study’s lead author was able to use the same prescriptions 
more than five times because many Internet pharmacies allow customers to fax their prescriptions 
and do not contact the doctor who wrote the prescription. None of the Internet pharmacies (n=55) 
included in this study queried why the lead author had a prescription from a doctor in Indiana when 
he lived in Washington, DC. 
Despite the relative ease of acquiring medications like opioids, Inciardi and colleagues (68) used five 
national data sets from the United States (three of which related to the abuse of prescription stimulants 
and opioid analgesics) to estimate who is using non-prescribed medications purchased online. According 
to the authors, the results suggest that the Internet is “a relatively minor source for illicit purchases of 
prescription medications by the end-users of these drugs” (68).

Internet pharmacy locations
Internet pharmacies have not always been straightforward about revealing where they are located. 
In 1999, Bloom and Iannacone (69) found that only five Internet pharmacies in a sample of 46 (11%) 
provided information concerning their geographic location beyond what information was offered online. 
This situation has improved but remains unresolved. Recent studies in 2009 and 2010 found that less than 
half of Internet pharmacy web sites disclose their location, 43% and 48% respectively (70, 61). 
In 2010, researchers purchased five popular drugs from various Internet pharmacies (59). Three of these 
online pharmacies claimed to be based in Canada or the United States and posted prices on their sites in 
dollars; however for any purchase made, they charged in Chinese or Indian currency. Even more convoluted 
was the online pharmacy that described itself as an “off-shore company based in Cyprus,” listed a contact 
address in British Columbia, received the initial money transfer for the medication purchased in Panama, 
shipped the order from Shanghai (according to the postmark), and labelled their tablets with the name of 
the brand name pharmaceutical company that sells it and “USA” (59).
Deceit about location raises concerns about an Internet pharmacy’s validity, its source of medications 
and their quality. Similarly, WHO has found that that medicines obtained from illegal Internet sites that 
obscure their physical address are counterfeit in more than 50% of cases (71).
Counterfeit and substandard medications
Counterfeit drugs may be contaminated, contain improper ingredients, incorrect ratios of the proper 
ingredients, contain no active ingredients, all of which can be very dangerous for people trying to manage 
or treat serious health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. The European Alliance for Access to 
Safe Medicines (EAASM) stated in their report, The counterfeiting superhighway, that 62% of medications 
purchased online are fake or substandard (e.g. expired or improperly stored during delivery) (72). 
Three years earlier the Office of Compliance in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research commissioned a study to evaluate the quality of five drug products purchased 
online from foreign sources compared to products purchased from a local supplier (73). Of the 20 samples 
received and tested, two failed United States Pharmacopeia (USP) monographs for quality attributes 
(dissolution and purity), which calls into question the bioavailability and safety of these products. 
Additional tests discovered that more than half of the samples (55%) had different formulations compared 
to the United States product, which is a serious quality issue.
Veronin and Nguyen (67) investigated 19 generic medication tablets and capsules they purchased from 
international Internet pharmacies and compared them to the United States innovator product. Five 
samples failed to meet USP standards for dissolution, and two failed for content uniformity. All 19 samples 
had issues with hardness, weight, and other physical characteristics. According to the investigators, this 
variability has implications for the safety and effectiveness of the online products. 
Review
 of the literature
25
While developing countries are obvious targets for counterfeit medications, due to both the high cost of 
legitimate drugs as well as the lack of regulatory controls and enforcement (74), quality control studies 
have been conducted predominantly in North America and Europe. A notable exception is a report by 
WHO stating counterfeit medications found in developed countries are generally expensive hormones, 
anti-cancer medications, or “lifestyle drugs” while those in developing countries are commonly used to 
treat conditions like malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS (71). 
Packaging and labelling
A drug’s packaging and labelling is an important safety feature. After purchasing a drug, the label affixed 
to the prescription container may be the only source of instructions a patient has on how it should be 
taken. The container is also the only mechanism used to maintain a product’s identity, strength, quality 
and purity. Child-resistant packaging also protects young children from accidental overdose or poisoning.
Despite its importance to consumers, packaging and labelling is often absent or deficient when 
pharmaceuticals are purchased over the Internet. Westenberger and colleagues (73) found that packaging 
was a significant problem for practically all of the samples they purchased online during their study. Many 
of the drugs had no or minimal information on their labels regarding the proper usage of the product, and 
some were written in foreign languages. 
More recently, Veronin (75) investigated the packaging of 41 drug products obtained from online 
pharmacies from 12 different countries. Of these samples, seven were dispensed in paper envelopes 
with an affixed label that was missing important information, such as directions for use, while 28 
products did not have labels at all. According to the authors, these substandard distribution processes 
present a challenge to patient comprehension and health literacy and may affect the patient’s 
adherence to their drug treatment regimen.
Summary
Based on this literature review, the risks of purchasing prescription pharmaceuticals from Internet 
pharmacies generally outweigh the potential benefits for consumers. It must be noted the research 
contained in this review primarily focuses on North America and Europe; conclusions drawn from these 
data, therefore, must be limited to describing the situation in these areas. No research on this topic 
was identified from developed or developing countries elsewhere in the world. A possible reason for 
this, however, may only reflect a time-lag of the medium: as some medications targeted by Internet 
pharmacies (e.g. sildenafil) are being increasingly used in parts of Latin America (e.g. Brazil, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Venezuela) as well as Africa and the Middle East (e.g. Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan) making 
them susceptible to the same model (76, 77). In these areas, where the social stigma for a condition 
like erectile dysfunction is even more pronounced, Internet availability of drugs like sildenafil without 
involving a prescriber may further exacerbate public health concerns (i.e. erectile dysfunction has a 
strong association with coronary heart disease, which may go untreated if patient is self-medicating) (78).

While data are not globally representative, there is sufficient evidence to back calls for stricter 
regulation of Internet pharmacies. As Mahe and colleagues (62) have delineated, multiple initiatives 
have been undertaken by international bodies: guidance by the World Health Organization, the U.S. 
FDA, and its European counterparts; creation of anti-counterfeit laboratories (i.e. 2008 inauguration 
of the Sanofi-Aventis Central Anti-Counterfeit Laboratory in France); creation of organizations to fight 
counterfeit medicines, notably those purchased on the Internet, such as EAASM, founded in 2007, and 
the International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT); and the intensification of 
international police enquiries.
While scientific research into the effectiveness of these types of regulatory initiatives is scarce, Boyer 
and Wines (79) found that increased regulation of, and law enforcement operations directed at, Internet 
pharmacies may lead to significant decreases in the availability of prescription medications like opioid 
analgesics offered for sale.
At least one study has shown that consumers can reduce the risks associated with buying prescription 
medications online by relying on the lists of recommended sites compiled by credentialing agencies like the 
National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (59). The NABP, with the support of the FDA, maintains 
a list of web sites likely to sell potentially harmful or illegal drugs. A programme with similar aims was 
launched by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGP) with its green cross logo. In 2010, 
Bate and Hess (59) tested the quality of five popular drugs purchased from web sites listed in the various 
categories provided by the NABP. Of the drugs analysed, none from the “approved”, “legally compliant”, 
or “not recommended” web sites (O out of 86) failed, whereas 8.6% (3 out of 35) failed from “highly not 
recommended” and unidentifiable web sites. Nonetheless, just creating awareness of these tools remains 
a challenge as consumers still predominantly use search engines to find Internet pharmacies; and even 
those search engines that purportedly integrate quality requirements (such as those by PharmacyChecker.
com) into their processes have been found to deliver unverified pharmacy web sites (80).
It can be concluded from this literature review that consumers need protection from the dangers 
posed by Internet pharmacies. The results from the 2009 eHealth survey presented later in this report 
will help determine the limits of current legislation in this area and provide a more in-depth picture of 
what needs to be done. Box 2 shows a model to verify the veracity of Internet pharmacies being used 
in Canada and the United States.

Box 2  One model of verifying Internet pharmacies: case 
study from North America
The NABP comprises member boards from all 50 United States and eight Canadian provinces along with 
New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Its mission is to assist its members in “developing, 
implementing, and enforcing uniform standards for the purpose of protecting the public health”.  In 
response to mounting public health concerns about the safety of pharmacies operating online, NABP 
created the Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) programme in 1999 (81). VIPPS Canada 
followed thereafter as a partnership between NABP and Canada’s National Association of Pharmacy 
Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) (82). VIPPS is also the lone consumer safety programme supported by 
the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration in the United States. 
In order to obtain certification and display the VIPPS seal, Internet pharmacies must satisfy 19 criteria 
including assurance of patient safety, authentication of prescription orders, and demonstration of a 
meaningful offer to establish a pharmacist-patient consult. For legitimacy, the logo is hyperlinked on sites 
that display it to the programme home page. The hyperlink will not work on sites fraudulently using the 
logo. Of the 8034 Internet pharmacy sites NABP has reviewed, 
less than 4% comply with good standards of practice; 8034 
were categorized as “not recommended” (83). Notable among 
criteria unsatisfied for those “not recommended” were 6812 
sites that did not require a prescription and 5089 which did 
not require a pre-existing relationship. While only 260 Internet 
pharmacy sites appeared to be potentially legitimate, this does 
represent a 15% increase from the previous year. 
Maintenance of this accreditation mandates reviews every three years following the initial application. 
So far almost 30 pharmacy companies representing over 12 000 brick-and-mortar pharmacies have 
completed the verification process. 
VIPPS empowers the public to make informed decisions about Internet pharmacy practice. It also 
serves as a valuable tool to help distinguish safe Internet pharmacies from Internet sites and drug 
outlets that are dangerous and a threat to public health (84).
—Dr Carmen Catizone, Executive Director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy
At least one study has indicated that consumers can reduce the risks associated with buying prescription 
medications online by relying on the lists of recommended sites compiled by credentialing agencies 
like the NABP (59). In 2010, Bate and Hess (59) tested the quality of five popular drugs purchased from 
web sites listed in the various categories provided by the NABP. Of the drugs analysed, none from the 
“approved”, “legally compliant” or “not recommended” web sites (0 out of 86) failed, whereas 8.6% (3 out 
of 35) failed from “highly not recommended” and unidentifiable web sites.
It is recommended that those seeking Internet pharmacy services should consider beginning with a search 
for a VIPPS approved site (85). NABP has created a resource to allow anyone to verify the status of an 
Internet pharmacy by its uniform resource locator (URL) (http://vipps.nabp.net/). Potential users of these 
types of sites may also reduce the chance of receiving counterfeit medications by availing themselves of 
Internet pharmacies that have undergone the VIPPS process (86). 
A programme modelled after VIPPS may represent a scalable solution to address some of the global issues 
facing Internet pharmacies.

2 2 Internet security 
Receiving unsolicited e-mail messages that are sent in bulk without the permission of the recipient, 
also known as spam (14), is a major problem for people using Internet communications. One case study 
examining the composition of e-mail found that of the subset of spam (n=1390), 39% was generated 
exclusively from medication and sexually targeted advertisements (87). 
Methodology
Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EBSCO databases, as well as Google 
Scholar, were searched for the periods January 1999 to March 2011 using search terms including ‘spam 
health, ‘spam medic*’, ‘spam e-mail’, ‘spam drug*’, ‘pharma* spam’, ‘pharma* e-mail’, ‘junk e-mail’, and 
‘pharma* phishing’.
The literature search also included a limited search of references retrieved from included articles but did 
not extend to searching Internet web sites, grey literature, conference abstracts, or contacting authors 
for unpublished data. Clinical studies, feasibility studies, survey studies, meta-analyses and review 
articles published in English and those obtainable in English translation, were considered for inclusion in 
this review. Lists of articles were deduplicated.
Pharmaceutical and health-related spam, spim, and spit
Unwanted, usually commercial, messages can come in a number of forms. Internet users are probably 
most familiar with spam e-mails; however, with the growth of online technology, spammers have begun to 
enter other communications arenas. With the increased use of instant messaging (IM) and text messaging 
or short message service (SMS), unwanted IM or SMS sessions containing commercial information are 
now appearing. This is sometimes known as “spim” or “spit” (spam over Internet telephony) (88), and 
spamming through social networking sites (e.g. Twitter) are also on the rise (88, 89).
While many people find these messages annoying and intrusive, they also pose a potential threat to 
those who engage with them. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Marketing 
Practices’ False claims in spam report (90), 66% of all e-mail spam contained false information, whether 
it was the sender’s name, the recipient’s name or information within the body of the message. This 
deceptiveness increased to 69% in health-related spam.
Despite its prevalence and potential risks, few original systematic studies on health-related spam have 
been conducted. Researchers have only just begun to investigate the effects spam and other unsolicited 
commercial messages have on their recipients.
Does spam affect consumer behaviour?
There are a handful of scientific studies investigating the relationship between consumer behaviour 
and spam e-mail. Morimoto and Chang (91) found that the favourability of a recipient’s attitude toward 
spam was inversely correlated to their perception of the advertisement’s intrusiveness and the amount 
of irritation caused. Women generally seem to dislike spam more than men due to the sexual nature of 
Review
 of the literature

much of its content (92). Despite the negative feelings people have about spam, they do not appear to be 
sufficiently motivated to take much personal action against it. According to a study conducted by Grimes 
(93), most e-mail users have not installed anti-spam filters despite the numerous filtering programs 
available for free or at very low cost.
While the majority of people take no action to filter spam, anywhere between 4% and 66% of people 
have purchased products advertised through spam e-mails (92, 94–97). Age may be a factor in the widely 
varying range of purchases. Grimes and colleagues (92) found that older adults are more likely to report 
purchasing a product from a spam e-mail than younger ones, although being affected by a socially 
stigmatized condition may be a contributing factor as well.
Fogel and Shlivko (98) investigated 200 recipients’ responses to spam e-mails advertising sexual 
performance products. Some of these participants had sexual performance problems while others did 
not. The results of the study showed that participants with sexual performance problems received (100% 
versus 73.5%, p=0.024), opened (66.7% versus 11.4%, p<0.001), and purchased more products (46.7% 
versus 5.4%, p<0.001) from spam e-mails than participants without sexual performance problems.
The authors speculated that the increased interest in spam e-mails was three-fold: 1) those affected 
by sexual performance problems may be so driven to enhance their sexual performance that they will 
consider any product or potential solution, even if it comes from a less-than-reputable source; 2) e-mail is 
a very private media and may be preferred to purchasing the same products from a pharmacy due to the 
embarrassment that often surrounds sensitive health issues like sexual performance; 3) those with sexual 
performance problems may not perceive spam advertisements as negative and intrusive since they are 
offering a product of interest (98).
A similar study conducted in 2010 by those researchers focused on the behaviour of 200 young adults 
who received spam e-mails advertising weight-loss products (17). As in their previous study, some of 
the participants had weight issues while some did not. Similarly, the participants with weight problems 
received (87.7% vs. 73.3%, p=0.02), opened (41.5% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001), and bought products (18.5% vs. 
5.2%, p=0.003) from spam e-mails more often than those without weight problems.
Reliability and validity of health products purchased from 
spam e-mails
One study of note was conducted investigating the actual process of purchasing health-related products 
via spam e-mails. During November 2006, Gernburd and Jadad (99) received 4153 spam messages in 
three separate e-mail accounts opened in Canada. Of these messages, 1334 (32%) were health-related. 
Throughout the last week of the study, the authors received 19 health-related spam e-mails from which 
they purchased 13 prescription drugs and 6 natural health products. During the ordering process, four 
web sites stopped working after the credit card information was submitted; no further information was 
provided to the ostensible customer to indicate if the transaction was successful. While 13 sites did not 
actually process the order, all of them recorded the full set of personal information provided, arguably 
the more valuable commodity.

Out of the 19 orders placed by the authors, 5 prescription drugs and 4 natural health products were 
delivered, although the quality of these products was not examined. Surprisingly, none of the credit 
card information appeared to be abused. The only fraud that was detected in this study was by one site 
that took payment for a product that was never delivered. However, based on research conducted with 
Internet pharmacies (see Section 2.1), it would stand to reason the risks of purchasing medications online 
through spam would be congruent.
Even if the products purchased were defective or harmful, very little action could be taken against the 
spammers because of the short half-life of the associated links (i.e. approximately 2 weeks). According to 
the authors, by the time the products were delivered the spammers had become “virtual ghosts”. Since 
the spammers could largely disappear without a trace, it precluded any real action being taken by law 
enforcement in the rare cases when consumers tried to report the incidents (99).
Summary
Because of the lack of published studies; this literature review raises more questions than answers. 
For example:
• How does spam affect consumers’ attitudes toward the pharmaceutical industry and online 
health information?
• Are products purchased through spam links safe and effective? Or are they counterfeit and 
substandard?
• How much of spam-linked content is valid, and which is part of a phishing scam?
• What are the incidence and effects of viruses and malware contained in health-related spam?
• What type of people open, read, and act upon spam messages and why? 
• Are consumers aware of the dangers of spam? Does this knowledge (or lack thereof) affect 
their behaviour?
Some legislation and other anti-spamming initiatives employed by Member States have shown promise. 
For example, in Japan, the 38 million customers using DoCoMo, Japan’s largest wireless company, received 
150 million pieces of spam a day on their cell phones before the passage of anti-spam legislation and just 
30 million pieces of spam a day after (100). However, this legislation is largely based on observational work. 
Hope and greed are powerful motivators, so as more people around the world begin to access the Internet 
and search for solutions to health and lifestyle problems, the number of e-mails, text messages, and 
mobile web solutions offering promises, legitimate or otherwise, will undoubtedly increase and customize 
to match the demand (99). Therefore, without increased research into the motivations of spammers and 
consumers and enhancing programmatic support, spam will be nearly impossible to eradicate.

2 3 Online safety of children and adolescents
It is normal today for children and adolescents to base their extracurricular activities around the Internet. 
With access to video games, chat rooms, and social networking, being ‘plugged in’ is one of the most 
popular pastimes for children. This is due, in part, to the fact that over 90% of children and adolescents 
in developed countries have access to the Internet (101). More specifically, the Pew Internet & American 
Life Project found that 93% of youth (i.e. aged 12–17 years) use the Internet (102). Rising or robust use 
of the Internet by children and adolescents has also been noted in research in many other countries 
ranging from Argentina to Guatemala (103) and Qatar (104) to Turkey (105). Considering the level of their 
connectivity and a transient lack of supervision and controls in place, children and adolescents are subject 
to online risk and can also become easy targets for online predators.
Methodology
Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EBSCO databases, as well as Google 
Scholar, were searched for the periods January 1999 to March 2011 using search terms including ‘online 
child* safety, ‘online child* health’, ‘Internet child* safety’, ‘Internet child* access’, ‘child* activity 
Internet’, ‘adolescent activity Internet’, ‘teen* activity Internet’, and, ‘child* OR teen* predators’.
The literature search also included a limited search of references retrieved from included articles but did 
not extend to searching Internet web sites, grey literature, conference abstracts, or contacting authors 
for unpublished data. Clinical studies, feasibility studies, survey studies, meta-analyses and review 
articles published in English and those obtainable in English translation, were considered for inclusion in 
this review. Lists of articles were deduplicated.
Are children and adolescents at risk when online?
As use of the Internet has greatly increased over the past twenty years, so has its role in becoming a 
useful forum for child predators. Since children have easy and often unsupervised access to the Internet, 
they are increasingly targeted for exploitation, sexual and emotional abuse, and maltreatment (30, 106). 
By being able to disguise their identity, sexual predators have a great advantage of being able to target 
and approach their young victims in many popular forums such as chat rooms and social media platforms 
(e.g. Facebook, Twitter) without them ever knowing (107). The single biggest risk in social media circles 
may be the individual’s complete “lack of control over where the information is going, how it will be 
posted, and who is going to be able to access it” (108). 
Children and adolescents online without supervision
Children and adolescents are using their online access without restriction and can be unaware they are 
putting themselves into compromising situations. Adolescents, in particular, are liable to adopt risky 
behaviour without considering consequences due to underlying neural and cognitive factors during age-
related brain maturation (109). A survey conducted in 2008 by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen 
and Unplanned Pregnancy found that 22% of teenage girls and 18% of teenage boys (aged 13–19 years), 
reported sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures or videos of themselves online. Of these teens, 
Re

ew
 o
f t
he
 li
te
ra
tu
re
32
15% reported that they sent these sexually suggestive images of themselves to someone they only knew 
online, usually to be “fun or flirtatious” (110). Similarly, due to the increasingly ubiquitous nature of mobile 
phones among all age groups, there has consequently been an increase in “sexting” among teenagers in 
which sexually suggestive photos and/or messages are sent via mobile phone (111). 
Without knowing the actual identity of perceived friends and relationships forged online, children could 
be unwittingly encouraging sexual predators. Online predators will attempt to leverage relationships with 
these vulnerable populations in order to manipulate behaviour (112). However, sexually explicit photos 
or information shared by children and adolescents online is not limited to placing them in compromising 
situations with predators; it can also lead to bullying or unwanted sexual advances by their peers. A study 
in the United Kingdom found that more than a third of the 2000 surveyed secondary school children had 
been sent messages of a sexual content (113). Another study generated from WHO data on behaviour in 
children revealed that 13.6% of children were the victim of cyberbullying (114). 
The link between children online and child pornography
With children and adolescents accessing the Internet unsupervised and engaging in discussions and 
pictures of a sexual nature, it is unfortunate, but unsurprising, that they would be highly susceptible to 
targeting by paedophiles and child pornographers (115). 
With little research being done concerning the numbers of children abused by child pornographers online 
(116), it is difficult to get a clear picture on the severity of this risk. There is also a lack of a consensus 
regarding an association between predilections to commit real-life offenses and collecting child 
pornography that may have slowed responses to this issue (117). Hence, the extent and magnitude of 
children and adolescents targeted by online child pornographers and sexual predators is unknown. 
Summary
Based on the evaluation of this literature review concerning the online safety of children and adolescents, 
this age group can be characterized as at-risk when online. Although there are many benefits to children 
and adolescents using the Internet for learning or improving skills, there is obviously a need for regulation 
or restrictions on the sites they are accessing and the amount of personal information they are providing to 
‘friends’ or ‘relationships’ forged online. Without cautionary guidelines for children who go online, there is 
an increased probability that they will experience exposure to some sort of exploitation during their usage.
With children and adolescents accessing the Internet unsupervised for lengthy periods of time every day 
(118), further research needs to be conducted on how many children are actually aware of the dangers 
of sexual predators online or are aware of the consequences of sending sexually explicit photographs of 
themselves via the World Wide Web (119). 
At the least, Member States should consider fostering awareness of the risks of sending personal 
information and photos online through school curricula and/or meetings between parents and teachers.

2 4 Digital literacy and online health information quality
After health information started to appear online, along with the promise it offered, concerns about the 
quality of that information and its potential impact were expressed (120, 121). This, in turn, led to the 
development of hundreds of instruments being created to measure online health information quality (122, 
123). Tools were created ranging from checklists like DISCERN (http://www.discern.org.uk/) to vetting 
systems such as the HON Foundation (See Box 1) (http://www.hon.ch) to guidelines from WHO (123). 
Evaluations of online health information quality have since been conducted for topics such as women’s 
health (124), malaria (125), medications (126), and sexual health (127) on web sites in English, French (128), 
Italian (129), Spanish (130), among others. More recently, with the rise of social media, health information 
is being shared via blogs, social networking sites, Twitter, and in particular Wikipedia; the quality of these 
sources is now being examined as well (131–136).
The Internet is a quick, convenient and private means for obtaining medical information, and when such 
information is accurate and appropriate, offers enormous potential for informed decision-making and 
greater participation of patients in their own care (137). As a result, much emphasis has been placed on 
the validity, accuracy, and completeness of online health information, with a large number of studies 
suggesting significant deficiencies in quality for online patient-oriented information covering a variety 
of medical conditions (138–143). These results have led to calls for improving or certifying the quality of 
health information online. However, ensuring there is accurate and complete health content available 
online is not enough; information seekers must be able to find and access it.
Methodology
Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EBSCO databases, as well as Google 
Scholar, were searched for the periods January 1999 to March 2011 using search terms including ‘online OR 
Internet health information’, ‘online OR Internet health information quality’, ‘quality online information’, 
‘digital literacy’, ‘Internet literacy’, ‘search engine*’, ‘online OR Internet health information accessibility’, 
‘assess online OR Internet information’, and ‘evaluate online OR Internet information’.
The literature search also included a limited search of references retrieved from included articles but did 
not extend to searching Internet web sites, grey literature, conference abstracts, or contacting authors 
for unpublished data. Clinical studies, feasibility studies, survey studies, meta-analyses and review 
articles published in English and those obtainable in English translation, were considered for inclusion in 
this review. Lists of articles were deduplicated.

Searching for health information online: is quality content 
easily accessible?
A wealth of health information is currently available on the Internet, and as previous studies have shown, 
the quality of the information presented varies greatly. But with well over 100 000 health-related web 
sites (144), it is impossible for information seekers to surf through them all. As a result, when confronted 
with a specific health-related question, nearly all Internet users (more than 95%) use a search engine (145, 
146). But do search engines retrieve the highest quality health information? And more importantly, does 
the way people conduct searches and assess the results provide them with information they can use to 
make educated health-related decisions?
The role of search engines
Three categories of search engines are available to help health information seekers retrieve information 
from the Internet: general search engines, meta-search engines, and medical search engines. General 
search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Bing were designed to be user-friendly programs for sourcing 
information via the Internet. Meta-search engines were developed to perform simultaneous searches 
within a select group of general search engines and then collate the results (147). Finally, medical search 
engines are much more specific, as they only catalog online medical information. Such searches generally 
retrieve fewer, but more relevant, results.
Despite the fact there are search engines specifically designed to retrieve information from selected web 
sites, general search engines are the most common starting points for health information searches (102, 
145, 146, 148, 149). This issue is particularly germane as new research has demonstrated up to one third 
of online searches for prescription drugs were the subject of search-redirect attacks; in effect the high-
ranking links were re-routed to infected host pharmacy sites (150). 
While general search engines have vastly improved user access to online health information, the criteria 
used to identify and rank health-related web sites vary considerably among search engines, and the 
method for ranking results often is not apparent to users (151). A web site’s ranking within the results 
returned by a search engine depends on its specific algorithm but may include variables such as the 
number of times a web site has been accessed from the results page, the structure and content of the 
web site, the search terminology employed by the user, and any use of paid placements (151).
A web site’s ranking within search results is extremely important because sites listed on the first page 
are “significantly more likely to be accessed by health information seekers, with an exponential decline 
thereafter” (145, 146, 152). 
Review
 of the literature
35
How do health information seekers search for information?
Several studies have investigated the methods different groups of Internet users employ to find answers 
to health-related questions online. Hansen and colleagues (146) examined the search strategies of 68 
adolescents and noted they were generally successful in finding correct and useful information to answer 
a health-related question. The majority of sites the teenagers accessed (87%) came directly from a list 
of search engine results, of which 10% were from a search engine’s list of recommended links. Eighty-
three per cent of participants clicked on links that appeared within the first nine results returned by the 
search engine. A qualitative assessment by the authors revealed that the teenagers used a trial-and-error 
approach for formulating their searches, randomly scanning pages rather than systematically evaluating 
them and did not consider the source of the information when answering health-related questions.
Eysenbach & Köhler (145) observed similar techniques among adults. The general search strategy of 
their participants was to try a number of initial search terms and briefly examine the contents of a page 
before iteratively refining their search. According to the authors, few of the participants noted, and later 
remembered, from which web sites they had gathered information. Buhi and colleagues (153) asserted 
that users need to be educated about how search engines prioritize and display their results and be trained 
to systematically evaluate health web sites for reliable information. Another author cautions, however, 
against too much analysis, which could lead to paralysis and may be consistent with the suggestion that 
“more is less” (154).
Quality of search engine results
As the majority of health information seekers never get past the first few pages of search engine results, 
determining the accuracy and reliability of the web sites listed on these pages is important for evaluating 
the quality of health information available to users (152). 
In a study evaluating online information about depression, Lissman and Boehnlein (155) observed that 
the quality of information retrieved by the search engines they utilized was very low. They also found that 
commercial web sites appeared much more frequently within the top 20 results returned by the search 
engines than not-for-profit sites. Based on the findings of two more recent studies, this may be because 
many of the top results are so-called sponsored links, meaning the web site owner has paid the search 
engine for higher placement (156, 157).
After sponsored links, the next most common site to appear in the first page of health-related search results 
is often Wikipedia (158). Wikipedia is the world’s largest reference web site and is the most successful 
example of a ‘wiki’, a site collaboratively written by its users. Since it began in January 2001, more than 3.3 
million articles have been generated and edited in English alone by volunteers worldwide, many of which 
are on medical topics (159). According to a 2009 study conducted by Laurent and Vickers (160), Wikipedia 
was listed within the first ten results in 71–85% of search engines for health-related keywords they tested. 
Since anyone, expert or layperson, is able to write and edit Wikipedia entries anonymously, concern has 
been raised over whether Wikipedia provides accurate information about health and medical topics. Two 
studies assessing the quality of Wikipedia content are discussed below.

The first, published by Clauson and colleagues (134), investigated the scope, completeness, and accuracy 
of drug information on Wikipedia in comparison to a free, online, traditionally-edited database, Medscape 
Drug Reference. Based on the results, Wikipedia had a narrower scope, was less complete, and had more 
errors of omission than the Medscape Drug Reference. The study also found that the medication entries 
in Wikipedia improved significantly over time (p=0.024) In the second study, Heilman and colleagues (159) 
reported that Wikipedia’s many medical articles contain few factual errors but that improvements need to 
be made in the depth and readability of individual articles. Both studies concluded that while Wikipedia 
may be a useful point of engagement, it should not be used as an authoritative source of health information.
Do Internet searches retrieve desired health information?
At least two studies have shown that only a small percentage of sites retrieved by online health keyword 
searches contain the information being sought. Rose and colleagues (161) used 25 commonly-used 
keywords to search for knee-related information online. The search generated nearly 6000 pages, 
of which only 395 (6.6%) contained actual knee-related information. McClung and colleagues (141) 
conducted similar searches using keywords such as “diarrhea” and “treatment” and evaluated the first 
300 search engine results. Of these results, just 23% (70 sites) contained information relevant to the topic.
However, other studies have shown that patients are easily able to find the information they are searching 
for online, although their evaluation of the sites may be lacking. Based on the results of Eysenbach and 
Köhler (145), Internet users successfully found the answers to health-related questions in an average of 
5 minutes 42 seconds (median 4 minutes 18 seconds) per question; however, their search techniques 
were often deemed to be suboptimal.
In a larger Australian study, 227 undergraduate students answered a set of health-related questions 
before and after using a search engine to retrieve online information from PubMed, MedlinePlus, and 
HealthInsite (162). The investigators found that searching quality health information sources improved 
the user’s accuracy in answering health-related questions (pre-search 61.2% versus post-search 82.0%, 
p<.001). However, they also discovered that searching the Internet increased users’ confidence in 
incorrect answers. This may be because a person’s prior belief (anchoring bias) may impact their search 
for information and their confidence in the answers found (163, 164).
Summary
This review suggests the web sites that users are more likely to access for health information are based 
on their ranking within general search engine results and usually are of lower quality than sites dedicated 
to health information (e.g. MedlinePlus). Further, it appears users are too rushed, unconcerned, or simply 
not savvy enough to evaluate the sources of information they use to answer health-related questions. As 
a result, researchers have recommended a number of ways to improve the overall quality of web sites 
accessed by health information seekers, as well as educating citizens.
Review
 of the literature
37
One possible approach is to promote the use of medical search engines such as Healthfinder (www.
healthfinder.gov) and HONsearch (www.hon.ch/HONsearch/Patients/index.html; also see Box 1) that 
only list information from trusted content providers as well as sites that perform similar aggregating 
functions of trusted resources like MedlinePlus (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/; also see Box 3) or 
other sites officially hosted by Member States and local institutions such as NHS Patient Choices (http://
www.nhs.uk) and CISMeF-patient (http://www.chu-rouen.fr/cismefp/). 
Three of the studies identified include those that evaluated the efficiency of medical search engines 
in sourcing relevant health information. All three studies found that, as with other search engines, the 
search specificity of medical search programs was low, with only about 10% of web sites retrieved being 
unique and relevant (165, 166, 147). However, the studies diverged on whether the overall quality of web 
sites retrieved by medical search engines was higher than general ones. Maloney and colleagues (147) 
assessed the quality of osteoarthritis information retrieved through general, medical, and meta-search 
engines and concluded that while the overall quality of the results was poor, the medical search engines 
identified higher-quality web sites. Conversely, medical search engines did not provide higher quality 
information about androgen deficiency in the ageing male or prostate cancer screening (165, 166). 
A second suggestion that has been posed is to encourage more health-care providers to specifically 
direct their patients to high-quality online health resources. Although less than 5% of patients currently 
use web sites recommended by their health-care providers when searching for health information, 
a handful of randomized controlled trials have shown that such advice does increase the use of 
recommended sites (167–169).
The variation among search engine listings and the prevalence of sponsored or recommended sites on 
the first page of results suggests that patients are often being directed to health-related web sites on 
commercial, rather than informative, grounds. Therefore, users need to become more educated about 
how search engines prioritize and display their results and learn to systematically evaluate health web 
sites before making any decisions based on information they find online. Health-care professionals 
also need to accept the growing role the Internet has in patient care and take responsibility for helping 
patients locate comprehensive and accurate online health information.
A strategic alternative to addressing these issues is the dot health (.health) proposal. The ambitious 
idea of creating .health as an Internet top-level domain (TLD) was first advanced in 2000. A TLD is the 
highest hierarchical level of a web address and is structurally analogous to .com, .org, and .edu (ICANN, 
2000). Creation of the .health TLD under the auspices of an international organization would contribute 
significantly to the protection of the public’s health through the global adoption of quality standards 
for health-related information and practices on the Internet. In leveraging the .health TLD, WHO could 
promote consensus building and broad adoption of quality standards for health-related information on 
the Internet. In addition to the generation of value, a .health TLD could be used to help protect information 
quality as well as privacy and safety of Member States’ citizens.

Responses to the questions in Section 6 of the second global survey on eHealth have been categorized 
into the following four areas:
1. Internet pharmacies
2. Internet security
3. Online safety of children and adolescents
4. Digital literacy and online health information quality
In this section, analyses and observations relating to each of these areas will be presented and the key 
trends and patterns will be discussed.
Full details of the survey methods including survey instrument development, data collection and 
processing, response rate and survey limitations are included in Appendix 1.
3 1  Internet pharmacies
In order to ascertain the current legal status and regulation of Internet pharmacies in Member States, 
responding countries were asked a series of four questions and invited to elaborate on their responses. 
These questions covered the general regulation of Internet pharmacy operations within their country as 
well as the online ordering of pharmaceuticals from other countries.

Regulation of Internet pharmacy operations
With the significant increase in the number of Internet pharmacies over the past decade, concern over 
the safety of the prescription medication dispensed online has also grown. While some online pharmacies 
are tightly controlled, like web-based enterprises managed by well-known corporate brands, there is 
also a growing number of rogue pharmacies dispensing prescription-only medications without valid 
prescriptions, providing counterfeit drugs of questionable quality, and failing to properly inform their 
customers about potential side-effects and dangerous drug interactions.
National and local governments have traditionally regulated the sale and dispensing of prescription drugs 
by pharmacies. However, when it comes to the online sale of these medications, regulation appears to 
be lagging. The majority of responding countries (66%) have no legislation either allowing or prohibiting 
Internet pharmacy operations (Figure 1). However, in those countries that do have regulations, the 
general trend appears to be for their prohibition (19% versus 7%).
As shown in Figure 2, when classified by World Bank income group, significantly more countries prohibit 
Internet pharmacy operations than allow them in every category except the low-income group. The 
same holds true when responding countries were divided into their respective WHO regions. In fact, 
the European, Americas, and Western Pacific Regions were the only constituencies with countries that 
formally allow Internet pharmacy operations (Figure 3).
Key findings
  The majority of responding countries (66%) have no legislation either allowing or prohibiting 
Internet pharmacy operations.
  Developed countries were more likely to have established legal policies than developing 
countries.
  Existing legislation prohibits Internet pharmacy operations more often than permitting it  
(19% versus 7%).

Respondents were also asked if their country regulates, accredits, or certifies Internet pharmacy sites. 
As with Internet pharmacy legislation, the vast majority of responding countries (86%) do not regulate, 
accredit, or certify Internet pharmacy sites.
Of the 7% of responding countries that do regulate, accredit, or certify Internet pharmacy sites, the 
vast majority are located in the European Region (Figure 4) and all are high- or upper-middle income 
countries (Figure 5).

Regulation of online purchase of pharmaceuticals from abroad
The Internet is truly a borderless medium. As such, regulating e-commerce like Internet pharmacies 
within the physical jurisdiction of a sovereign state is extremely difficult and such regulation becomes 
even more problematic when the pharmacies originate outside of a nation’s jurisdiction. The difficulty of 
this task is echoed in the survey results, as 75% of responding countries have no legislation permitting or 
prohibiting the online purchase of medications from other countries.
Figure 6 shows the proportion of responding countries with policies concerning the online purchase of 
pharmaceuticals from abroad, categorized according to WHO region. The European Region was by far 
the most likely to have legislation, with nearly 53% of responding countries having some form of policy. 
It was the only region in which countries legally permit the online purchase of medications originating 
non-domestically. Notably, Norway responded that it has legislation which prohibits Internet pharmacy 
operations based in its own country, but allows purchase from other countries. 
Figure 6. Legislation of online purchase of pharmaceuticals from abroad, by WHO region
Key findings
  Globally, the online purchase of medications from other countries is largely unregulated, with 
75% of responding countries having no legislation permitting or prohibiting the practice.
  The European Region has the largest percentage of countries with some type of legislation. 
  Nearly 80% of responding countries do not have, do not know, or did not respond if there were 
consequences for breach of laws regulating online purchases of pharmaceuticals.

Figure 7 shows the percentage of countries reporting legislation that allows or prohibits online medication 
purchases from abroad based on World Bank income groups. The results reflect a common trend with 
high-income countries being more likely to have such a policy than those countries in the upper-middle, 
lower-middle, and low-income brackets.
Figure 7. Legislation of online purchase of pharmaceuticals from abroad, by World Bank income group
Countries with policies prohibiting the online ordering of pharmaceuticals from other countries were also 
asked to describe the consequences for breach of the law. The particular penalties included in the survey were:
• Seizure of goods
• Consumer fine or prosecution
• No consequences
• Other
Only 20% of responding countries provided a specific consequence associated with ordering 
pharmaceuticals from foreign countries over the Internet. Of the remaining countries, 20% said there 
were no consequences for breaching the law, 28% did not know if there were consequences and 31% did 
not answer (Figure 8).

Table 6 summarizes the consequences for breach of law, including a description of any penalty described 
by responding Member States as “other”. It is important to note that some countries stating there was 
no legislation, or even that their government allows the online purchase of pharmaceuticals from foreign 
countries, provided examples of consequences under “other”.
For example, among the countries that responded there was legislation allowing Internet pharmacy sales 
purchased online from other countries, three later responded that the consequence for breach of law was 
seizure of goods and/or consumer fine or prosecution. In the same way, four countries which responded “no 
legislation” (Azerbaijan, Iceland, India, Malaysia), gave seizure of goods as a consequence for breach of law.
These seemingly contrary replies appeared to occur most often in countries which allow online ordering 
of pharmaceuticals (e.g. Germany responded “allows” for question 6.16), but only from a limited 
number of other countries (and thus entered a consequence for breach of law in question 6.17). It is 
quite possible that the legislative situation within countries is not straightforward, which would lead to 
reasonable explanations for why so many responses to this series of questions seemed inconsistent on 
the surface, as exemplified by Germany.

Implications
As detailed in Section 2, many of the risks associated with online pharmaceutical purchases are compounded 
when Internet pharmacies located in foreign countries. This is because without suitable harmonized 
legislation, treaties, and cooperative agreements between Member States, rogue Internet pharmacies 
can evade stringent regulation by operating their web sites within jurisdictions having the least restrictive 
regulatory framework. The lack of legal statutes and inconsistent consequences for breach of law globally 
and within WHO regions reflects the need for greater development of governance mechanisms to facilitate 
the creation of political and legal frameworks for the online sale of pharmaceuticals.
3 2 Internet security 
As outlined in the GOe survey, preservation of trust online is an important element as eHealth matures. 
The issue of unsolicited electronic messages sent in bulk, known as spam, is growing exponentially and 
threatens to undermine this trust. In recent years spam has evolved from disruptive, malicious messages 
or irritating advertising into a global business linked to crime, fraud, and identity theft.
To establish how Member States are dealing with escalating Internet security issues, countries were 
asked to describe what actions were being taken to reduce spam.
Figure 9 illustrates that technology filters at both the Internet service provider (ISP) level (67%) and the 
organizational/business level (75%) are the most popular methods for combating spam. Government 
intervention (e.g. laws, regulations), educational programmes for consumers and professionals, and 
mechanisms to report abuse also exist but on a much smaller scale.
Figure 10 shows that government interventions (55%), education (52%), and reporting (55%) are much 
more frequently used in high-income countries than in low-income countries. Unsurprisingly, developed 
countries also report a higher use of technology to combat spam than developing ones.
When divided into WHO regions (Figure 11), filters at the local (i.e. organizational/business) level ranked as 
the number one preventive action in the African (63%), Eastern Mediterranean (71%), and Americas (92%) 
Regions and shared this ranking with ISP filters in the European (81%) and South-East Asia (88%) Regions.
Key findings
  Overall, technology filters are the most common method for combating spam among 
responding countries.
  Government intervention, educational programmes, and mechanisms to report abuse are 
much more likely to occur in high-income countries.
  Local filters at the organizational/business level are the primary way to prevent spam in all 
WHO regions.

Despite the reliance on technological solutions, several countries indicated that a multi-pronged strategy 
was needed in order to combat the threats posed by spam. Singapore has developed a programme that 
combines the benefits of a public education programme, appropriate technology measures, industry 
self-regulation, spam control legislation, and international cooperation to curb spam.
Canada has also undertaken a number of efforts and initiatives to help deal more effectively with spam. 
The Working Group on Anti-Spam Technology and Network Management began in 2004 to bring various 
industry groups together to encourage the broad adoption of best practices among ISPs, other network 
operators, and large enterprise users (170). The Anti-Spam Action Plan for Canada was also introduced at 
that time (171). In December 2010, Canada passed extensive anti-spam legislation (i.e. Fighting Internet 
and Wireless Spam Act) (172) that includes formation of a Spam Reporting Centre, which will come 
into force following a Governor in Council order (173). Parallel and temporally similar efforts were also 
made with the introduction of the so-called CAN-SPAM Act (i.e. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited 
Pornography and Marketing) (174). Finally, the efforts of The Spamhaus project, detailed in Section 1, also 
deserve mention.

Figure 11. Actions to reduce spam, by WHO region
Implications
Based on the results of the survey it would appear that many Member States have either actively or 
passively decided to leave the matter of safeguarding against spam to individual businesses, organizations, 
and citizens. This may be, in part, as most popular e-mail clients have built-in spam filters that pre-sort 
incoming e-mail messages and can block up to 98% of spam messages, ensuring that the majority of the 
messages found in an individual’s inbox is genuine e-mail (175). However, local spam filters have no effect 
at all in combating the distribution of spam messages. 
According to survey responses, only 34% of responding Member States have government laws or 
regulations in place to stem the tide of spam. To compound the issue, few developing nations have other 
types of law, such as consumer protection laws, privacy or network security laws, or computer crime 
regulations that could be used to prosecute spammers. As a result, many Member States are not only 
restricted in their ability to keep spammers from exploiting their citizens but also in preventing spammers 
from using their countries as a base for sending spam to other countries.
Spam is a global problem; therefore, international cooperation is key. It is clear from these results that further 
promotion and development of an international, multi-pronged approach to reducing spam is needed.

3 3 Online safety of children and adolescents
The development of the Internet has created a communication medium that exists apart from the 
confines and structure of the ‘real world’, as well as away from the prying eyes of parents. While children 
and adolescents relish the freedom that the Internet and online anonymity can bring, it also carries with 
it hidden dangers, like sexual predators and the threat of cyberbullying.
Information and education about Internet safety
Although there are many stakeholders responsible for the safety of children and teenagers online, 
countries were asked to focus on their government’s efforts in this area. According to the survey results, 
47% of responding countries have government-sponsored web sites or official initiatives that provide 
appropriate information and education about Internet safety and literacy (Figure 12). Following a 
common trend, the highest percentage (81%) was found in high-income countries (Figure 13).
When aggregated by WHO region, 75% of responding countries from the South-East Asia Region had 
these web sites and official initiatives, while inroads had also been made in countries of the European 
(67%) and Americas (67%) Regions (Figure 14). 
Figure 12. Existence of official web sites or initiatives, globally
Key findings
  Less than half of responding countries have government-sponsored web sites or official 
initiatives educating citizens about Internet safety and literacy.
  Seventy-five per cent of governments responding from the South-East Asia Region sponsored 
online education initiatives; substantial efforts were also made in the European and Americas 
Regions (67%).
  Ninety-three per cent of countries with government-sponsored online education programmes 
had efforts aimed specifically at children.
  The Regions of South-East Asia, Europe, and the Americas had the highest rates of initiatives 
directed at raising awareness of Internet safety specifically among children and teenagers.

Figure 14. Web sites or initiatives by WHO region
Responding countries indicating that there were government-sponsored web sites or official initiatives 
in their countries were then asked whether any of these efforts were aimed specifically at protecting 
children. The vast majority (93%) responded in the affirmative (Figure 15).
Figure 16 shows responses to this question by World Bank income group. While the majority of countries 
with official informative web sites and initiatives have ones specifically directed at children and teenagers, 
these are mostly high-income countries. Taken as a whole, 48% of high-income countries, 24% of upper-
middle income countries, 20% of lower-middle income countries, and 8% of low-income countries have 
initiatives explicitly designed to educate children and teenagers about online safety.
It is interesting to note the WHO regional lines (Figure 17) upon which age-targeted efforts were developed. 
The European (44%), Americas (14%), South-East Asia (12%), and African Regions were the most proactive 
in implementing initiatives specifically directed at raising awareness among children and teenagers, while 
the existence of such initiatives in the Western Pacific (8%), Eastern Mediterranean (8%) Regions were low.

Safety and security requirements
While social and educational strategies are important for empowering children and adolescents to make 
responsible choices and avoid potentially dangerous situations online, technology solutions and public 
policy are equally important. To determine the current regulatory environment, countries were asked 
whether safety tools and security technologies were required by law for schools, libraries, and other 
public places with Internet facilities used by children.
Nearly half (48%) of responding countries do not legally require safety tools and security technologies 
in public places where children access the Internet (Figure 18). Even when stratified by income the 
percentages were still low, with just 26% of high-income and 43% of upper-middle income countries 
requiring such technologies (Figure 19). The disproportionately large gap between upper-middle income 
countries and high-income countries is notable; no correlation is observed between high-income 
countries and technology-focused legislation for this question.  
Figure 20 shows the prevalence of legal requirements for the use of safety tools and security technologies 
in public Internet facilities used by children, by WHO region. The results show that the Regions of the 
Americas (67%) and Europe (28%) have a higher percentage of countries with legislation than other regions.
However, just because there is no legal requirement for safety tools and security technologies does not 
mean that countries responding negatively do not have protective measures in place in public places where 
children access the Internet. For example, in Paraguay security keys/passwords are generally used to limit 
access to web sites inappropriate for children. There are no specific legal requirements, simply filter systems.
Key findings
  Less than a quarter (22%) of responding countries legally require the use of safety tools and 
security technologies in public places where children access the Internet. 
  Even in high-income countries only 26% have legal requirements for these safety features in 
public Internet facilities used by children.
  The Regions of the Americas and Europe have higher percentages of countries with legislation 
than other WHO regions.

Implications
Social and educational strategies are central to the development of responsible decision-making and 
appropriate online behaviour in children and adolescents in order to protect them from the many 
dangers that lurk online. Because online content is increasingly ‘user-driven,’ users are becoming 
progressively more accountable for their personal well-being online. Their individual choices and 
behaviours on the Internet can help determine whether their online experiences are positive or 
negative. As a result, safety education for children, adolescents, teachers, parents, and other caregivers 
is becoming increasingly important.
Unfortunately, online education initiatives seem to be linked to income level, with much higher 
percentages of high- and upper-middle income countries backing initiatives dedicated to educating 
children and teenagers about online safety. While this may be partly because fewer children and 
teenagers have Internet access on demand in developing nations, there is still the potential for significant 
child exploitation online. 
As different children in different regions of the world are subject to varying levels of risk, Member States 
need to evaluate and identify potential online hazards for children and adolescents living within their 
borders and develop a targeted approach to education, prevention, and intervention.

3 4 Digital literacy and online health information quality
The quality of health information on the Internet has been the subject of debate for a decade. While 
there are a number of high-quality, well researched, clinically informed eHealth sites available, health 
information of dubious quality, widespread fraud, potentially dangerous claims and a high risk of exposure 
to harm also exist online. As with all information found through search engines and other methods, the 
user must be able to critically evaluate the source and its claims before taking action, highlighting the 
importance of digital literacy.
To evaluate current government eHealth quality control practices, survey participants were asked to 
give details about their country’s approaches for ensuring the quality of health-related content on the 
Internet. The particular mechanisms included in the survey were:
• voluntary compliance by content providers or web site owners to quality criteria for health-
related sites;
• technology (e.g. filters and controls);
• education programmes for consumers and professionals;
• official approval (e.g. certification, accreditation, seals of approval, quality seals); and
• other.
Figure 21 gives an overview of the overall use of the aforementioned quality control mechanisms. 
Voluntary compliance was the most commonly reported climate of control, with 55% of responding 
countries indicating it for their country. Technology (28%), government intervention (26%), and education 
programmes (23%) were also used by responding countries, while official approval or other methods 
were utilized by a small percentage (16% and 5% respectively).
Figure 22 shows the use of the various quality control measures based on World Bank income group. 
While the pattern of results is consistent for all income levels, the highest levels recorded for voluntary 
compliance and the lowest levels for official approval and other methods show that the magnitude of 
utilization is appreciably different between developed and developing countries. For example, nearly 
70% of high- and upper-middle income countries employ voluntary compliance, while only 33% of low-
income countries do so.
Figure 23 provides an additional perspective, displaying the same countries by WHO region. It is 
interesting to note that 100% of an albeit small number of responding countries (eight) in the South-East 
Asia Region report voluntary compliance, with significantly lower levels of government interventions, 
technology, education, and other mechanisms (between 0 and 38%). In the African Region approximately 
20% of countries affirm voluntary compliance, government intervention and technology mechanisms.
Key findings
  Voluntary compliance (55%) was the most common quality control mechanism indicated by 
responding countries in all regions and income levels.

Implications
Despite the fact that a large number of people base important health decisions on information they find 
on the Internet, there is very little being done to ensure the accurate reporting of health information 
online. Currently, it is the responsibility of the individual site to determine the quality of health-related 
content. As a significant amount of time, effort, and money would be required to establish governance 
mechanisms to facilitate the development and implementation of policy and legal frameworks, a better 
option may be to invest in educational programmes to increase digital literacy.
Erroneous and deceitful health information is particularly dangerous if acted upon unquestioningly. By 
improving the public’s critical evaluation of health information, citizens will be empowered to make 
better, more informed decisions about the health content found online.
Government-sponsored eHealth sites providing authoritative content can also serve as a complement to 
digital literacy initiatives. Such sites would provide a benchmark of quality by which other online health 
information can be judged.

9 The practice of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people and 
especially from the online community rather than from traditional employees or suppliers.
10 Used by actors in health care including doctors, patients, and scientists, Medicine 2.0 / Health 2.0 is a specific set of Web 
tools (blogs, podcasts, tagging, search, wikis, etc.) – founded on principles of open source and user generated content, 
as well as the power of networks – to personalize health care, collaborate, and promote health education (177).

Box 3  How one medical student 'crowd-sourced' curation 
of quality online health information in 17 languages 
A young man named Bertalan Mesko attending medical school in Debrecen, Hungary was using his blog as a 
platform to collect and share information on ‘Medicine 2.0’ and network with others from all over the world. 
Noting the difficulty that even fairly Internet savvy health-care professionals and patients had in identifying, 
managing, and organizing reputable sources of health information online and keeping abreast of new 
medical developments, he elected to develop a new aggregation tool called PeRSSonalized medicine (176). 
This tool functions similarly to existing RSS (Really Simple Syndication) in that it aggregates ‘feeds’ of 
information that could be set to automatically push to the end-user. However, it removed what little 
complexity that did exist by making it more similar to choosing items from a menu than configuring a tool. 
This menu of medical information was based 
on the interests of the individual patient or 
provider and included conditions such as 
depression, specialties like cardiology, and 
other categories such as a customized feed 
for the Pan American Health Organization 
(PAHO). 
As this resource evolved, the capacity for any 
one individual to hand-select all the feeds was 
exceeded and the now Dr Bertalan Mesko 
capitalized on the collaborative nature of Web 
2.0. He began to ‘crowd-source’ information 
by putting out a call to his social networks 
for items to be included and eventually 
PeRSSonalized medicine grew to encompass 
80 different medical specialties and conditions 
that are curated today. Similarly, he started 
to solicit additional contributions, which 
resulted in health information resources being 
aggregated in 17 different languages including 
English, Spanish, Hungarian, French, German, 
Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian.
I realized how hard it is for either medical professionals or empowered patients to keep themselves up-
to-date in a medical specialty or condition…Later it was clear we need to develop national versions as 
well, that is why 17 languages are available in PeRSSonalized Medicine now (178).
—Dr Bertalan Mesko
While PeRSSonalized medicine now stands as a massive resource that is freely available to anyone, it is 
more a testament to the potential for one person to help make a difference, especially when that person 
taps into the cognitive philanthropy of the crowd.

The Internet pharmacy has moved beyond its nascent stage into a more widely adopted and legislated 
extension as a potentially trusted source of medications and pharmaceutical care. However, rogue 
pharmacies – increasingly advertised through spam messages – still plague those using the Internet. Due 
to a dearth of vetted, high-quality online health information, people mostly have access to untrustworthy 
health information online, and are putting themselves at risk of virus programs and phishing scams. Spam 
also continues to be the bane of e-mail users worldwide. 
Is the answer to Internet pharmacies a blanket ban? Unconditional, unrestricted access? Or the 
juxtaposition of intelligent legislation, good practices, and coordinated vigilance? How can we best 
capitalize on freely available Internet-based health information to empower patients for the evolving 
participatory medicine model? What protections need to be in place to safeguard citizens and their children 
from Internet-based threats? This publication has provided a snapshot of current practices, responses to 
issues by Member States, and case studies examining the transformation of cautionary tales to tales 
of success. The information contained within this volume is provided for stakeholders including policy-
makers, practitioners, and patients in the interest of a sustainable provision of equitable health care. The 
summary conclusions that follow are intended to assist stakeholders in informing their decision-making 
processes regarding Internet pharmacies and online safety and information quality. These conclusions 
are derived from feedback supplied by Member States in responding to a subset of items on the 2009 
global survey on eHealth administered by WHO.

Overall, the results describe an atmosphere of uncertainty regarding Internet pharmacy. Despite existing 
as a business and practice model in some parts of the world for over ten years, Internet pharmacy remains 
legislatively unaddressed by the majority of responding countries (Figure 1). As policies were likely 
reactionary and temporally related to the emergence of this model of pharmacy, developed countries 
correspondingly were more likely than developing countries to have general legislation and specific policies 
in place. However, even among the minority of countries who have broached the topic, as a matter of policy 
they have elected to simply prohibit their operations rather than permit them (Figure 1). Regardless of the 
stance, Member States should adopt formal positions regulating Internet pharmacy to protect public health 
and, when feasible, create an alternative but secure distribution channel for delivery of essential medicines. 
Member States with existing legislation identified in this volume (China, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, 
Latvia, Poland, Portugal, USA) can be a valuable point of contact and data for other countries wishing to 
move forward in this arena. Organizations and institutions including the FIP as well as boards of pharmacy 
in each respective Member State also merit consulting based on their work in these areas. 
In concert with, or following determination of, a basic domestic legislative approach, regulating the 
external online sale of pharmaceuticals should be considered a priority. Even fewer Member States have 
policies in place determining whether or not medications from other countries are legally permitted or 
restricted (Figures 6 and 7). Significantly, almost 80% of responding countries did not have consequences 
for breach of law using Internet pharmacies, were not aware of such consequences, or did not respond 
to the question. The key to addressing this deficit is in developing and enacting enforceable legislation 
that supports public health while satisfying any harmonization requirements that may be in place with 
neighbouring countries or trade partners. International pharmacy law experts and Member States with 
current legislation may again serve as resources.
Spam – unsolicited messages sent to e-mail and mobile devices in bulk – and other types of Internet 
security threats continue to be a scourge: costing citizens and Member States significant resources to 
bolster Internet and e-mail security, as well as mitigate the effects of successful attacks. Technology filters 
both at the local (e.g. business) and ISP levels (Figure 9) remain the primary line of defence for Member 
States against spam. While governmental intervention and educational programmes are also mechanisms 
used to combat it, these tactics are more prevalent in World Bank designated high-income countries. 
A two-pronged approach is recommended to counter distribution and receipt of spam based on the 
findings in this volume, including continued international support of non-profit-making efforts (e.g. 
Spamhaus), as well as consolidation of fragmented educational efforts. It may also behove Member 
States to develop stronger definitions, penalties, and enforcement for spam along with aligning with the 
cybersecurity efforts of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Some responding countries 
indicated that legislative acts addressing spam had been created, but had never been enacted into law 
and/or a lack of media coverage stifled awareness about its existence thereby compromising capacity for 
enforcement. Additionally, findings suggest reallocating existing resources – currently diluted in multiple 
ways – to educational programmes to help avoid the more serious threats that can accompany spam (e.g. 
viruses, spyware) and specifically increase vigilance regarding medical identity theft in upper-middle and 
high-income countries.
Conclusions
63
While security issues such as spam create problems numbering in the billions of any currency, the most 
polarizing public health threat presented by the Internet may be as a means to intentionally or unwittingly 
jeopardize the safety of children and adolescents. Threats from this medium encompass those from 
predatory adults, cyberbullying from peers, and poor personal judgment by teens that elect to engage in 
activities like ‘sexting’ without thought of consequence. Despite this state of affairs, less than a quarter 
of responding countries legally require the use of safety tools and security technologies in public places 
where children access the Internet (Figure 18). Among high- and upper-middle income countries, however, 
a collective 69% have those legal requirements in place to protect children (Figure 19). Overall the most 
progressive WHO region in implementing these measures is the Region of the Americas (Figure 20).
For those Member States contemplating introduction, prioritization, or strengthening of such legislation, 
libraries, schools, and community centres granting Internet access to children and teenagers are natural 
foci for directing legislative and intervention efforts to enhance child safety. Guidance in these efforts 
may be sought in the form of the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI). Given the sometimes slow wheels 
of the legislative process and for deriving maximum benefit, child safety programmatic initiatives should 
also be considered in a similarly geographically-targeted manner.
Moving into the next decade, Internet safety and literacy present enormous challenges, considering basic 
and health literacy are still hurdles to be overcome in most Member States. Currently, less than half of 
responding countries utilize government-sponsored web sites or official initiatives to educate citizens 
about Internet safety and literacy. Paralleling its proclivity for early adoption of technology and innovation, 
government sponsored initiatives are seen most commonly in the South-East Asia Region; there are 
also strong programmes in the European and Americas Regions (Figure 14). Echoing these findings, the 
European Region and – to a much lesser extent – the Region of the Americas have the highest rates 
of initiatives specifically directed at protecting children and adolescents (Figure 17). Countries in other 
regions should consider prioritizing this area; lower rates of Internet penetration insulated the youth of 
those areas to an extent previously, but with the explosion of mobile accessibility as reported in mHealth: 
new horizons for health through mobile technologies (179), the face of Internet access has changed. 
Universally, Member States would benefit both from existing efforts and could explore formalizing or 
codifying educational practices to integrate digital literacy and awareness of online safety issues into 
requisite schooling and adult education. 
The capacity for digital literacy is intertwined with accessibility to, and quality of, online health 
information. It is anticipated that the importance of these issues will become even more prominent as a 
greater percentage of the global public gains ready access to the Internet and health information seekers 
grow more likely to take action based upon what they find. Thus far, voluntary compliance by web site 
operators and content providers is the most commonly cited control mechanism by Member States to 
help ensure the quality of health information online (Figure 21). However, within this approach there 
is great variability based on World Bank classifications: nearly 70% of high- and upper-middle income 
countries employ voluntary compliance, whereas only 33% of low-income countries take such action 
(Figure 22). Interestingly, strategies to address health quality online by Member States were wide-ranging, 
as indicated by the spectrum of answers received to the “other” category for this survey item (Table 7).

Solutions for managing the quality of health information proposed were inclusive of town, state, 
provincial, and country levels. Technological approaches such as medically focused search engines have 
been explored and ‘seals of approval’ conferred by a third party regardless of geography or government 
(like the HONcode seal; Box 1) have also been examined. These tools have limited utility considering 
the rapid global expansion of the Internet. The most holistic and ambitious plan proposed to date is the 
creation of the dot health (.health) TLD. Development of a dot health TLD as a recognizable label for 
quality health-related information sources on the Internet would raise awareness of health information 
quality issues. It would overcome a serious shortcoming of existing codes of conduct by enabling codes to 
be enforced; however, it would not regulate, restrict or censure health content on the Internet. 
Developing countries would benefit from being able to use a domain where standards are not the problem 
of governments alone to solve. The standards would protect consumers with measures for privacy 
and security, as well as benefit national health systems as they increasingly integrate the Internet into 
their operations. Dot health’s operational model is most likely to be a consortium led by an appropriate 
international organization and with a membership of high-level stakeholders with interests in public health.

Purpose
The World Health Organization’s eHealth resolution WHA 58.28 was adopted in 2005 and focused on 
strengthening health systems in countries through the use of eHealth (1); building public-private 
partnerships in ICT development and deployment for health; supporting capacity building for the 
application of eHealth in Member States; and the development and adoption of standards. Success in 
these areas is predicated on a fifth strategic direction: monitoring, documenting and analysing trends 
and developments in eHealth and publishing the results to promote better understanding. In direct 
response to the eHealth resolution, the Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) was established to monitor 
and analyse the evolution of eHealth in countries and to support national planning through the provision 
of strategic information.
The GOe’s first objective was to undertake a global survey on eHealth to determine a series of benchmarks 
at national, regional and global levels in the adoption of the necessary foundation actions to support the 
growth of eHealth. The aim was to provide governments with data that could be used as benchmarks for 
their own development as well as a way to compare their own progress with that of other Member States. 
The survey is part of the mandate defined during the GOe’s inception – to provide Member States with 
reliable information and guidance on best practices, policies and standards in eHealth.
The second global survey on eHealth was conducted in late 2009 and was designed to build upon the 
knowledge base generated by the first survey. While the first survey conducted in 2005 was more general 
and primarily asked high-level questions at the national level, the 2009 survey was thematically designed 
and presented more detailed questions. The thematic design of the survey has provided the GOe with a 
rich source of data that is being used to create a series of eight publications – The Global Observatory for 
eHealth Series – due for publication during 2010 and 2011.
Each publication in the series is primarily targeted to ministries of health, ministries of information 
technology, ministries of telecommunications, academics, researchers, eHealth professionals, 
nongovernmental organizations involved in eHealth, donors, and private sector partners.

Survey implementation
Based on the experience of the first global survey, the GOe benefited from many of the lessons learned 
in creating the second survey, disseminating the instrument in digital format, working with WHO 
regional offices and Member States to encourage survey completion, as well as processing the data 
and analysing the results. 
Survey instrument
The instrument focused on issues relating to processes and outcomes in key eHealth areas. Objectives for 
the survey were to identify and analyse trends in the: 
• Uptake of eHealth foundation policies and strategies, building on the 2005 results 
• Deployment of mHealth initiatives in countries 
• Application of telemedicine solutions 
• Adoption of eLearning for health professionals and students 
• Collection, processing and transfer of patient information 
• Development of legal and ethical frameworks for patient information in digital format
• Action concerning online child safety, Internet pharmacies, health information on the 
Internet, and spam 
• Governance and organization of eHealth in countries.

Survey development
The survey instrument was developed by the GOe with broad consultation and input from eHealth. 
Planning for the 2009 global survey started in 2008 with the review of the 2005/2006 survey results, 
instrument and feedback from participating countries. One of the constraints identified in the first survey 
was on the management of data and its availability for compilation and analysis. In order to facilitate 
data collection and management, Data Collector (DataCol)12 was used to make the survey instrument 
available online and therefore streamlining the collection and processing of data. 
A set of questions was developed and circulated in the first quarter of 2009 for comments to selected 
partners in all regions through virtual teleconferences. The range of partners included those from 
government, WHO regional and country offices, collaborating centres and professional associations. 
Over 50 experts worldwide were involved in the process. Collaborative efforts extended to other WHO 
programmes as well as international organizations, such as the International Telecommunications Union 
(ITU) and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). An online forum to discuss 
the survey instrument and survey process was developed and hosted by the Institute for Triple Helix 
Innovation based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in the United States of America.13  
A draft questionnaire was developed and posted online for review by the partners and was pilot tested 
in March 2009 in five countries: Canada, Lebanon, Norway, Philippines, and Thailand. The final version 
of the survey instrument was enhanced based on the comments and observations received from the 
pilot testing. In order encourage countries to respond, the survey questions, instructions and data entry 
procedures were translated into all WHO official languages plus Portuguese. 
Data Collector
Data Collector, DataCol, is a web-based tool that simplifies online form creation for data collection and 
management and is designed, developed and supported by WHO. The collected data are stored in a SQL 
database maintained by WHO database administrators, and can be exported as a Microsoft Excel file for 
further analysis using other statistical software.
This is the first time that DataCol has been used as the primary method of implementing an online survey 
of over 40 pages of text and questions. Significant preparation and testing was required to ensure that 
the system was robust and able to accommodate the data entry process from around the world, as well 
as the volume of data entered and stored online. 
The various language versions of the survey instrument and supporting documentation were entered into 
DataCol by language. In addition, individual country login names and passwords were assigned to ensure 
that only one entry was submitted per country rather than multiple entries. Country coordinators were 
responsible for completing the forms after obtaining agreement from the expert informant group.

Preparation to launch the survey
One of the most important tasks in executing an international survey is to build a network of partners at 
the regional level who can liaise directly with countries.
Due to differing priorities across WHO regions, not all regional offices have staff whose responsibilities 
included eHealth activities. For this reason many regional offices had to assign staff to assist in coordinating 
the survey process with countries in their respective region. Instructions for the survey procedures were 
circulated and were followed by a series of teleconferences. 
One significant outcome during the survey implementation was the development of strong and 
productive working relationships with regional counterparts, without whom it would not have been 
possible to successfully undertake such a task. The success of the survey implementation can also be 
attributed to the assistance of regional and national office colleagues who worked directly with national 
counterparts in completing the questionnaire.

Survey 
The survey was launched on 15 June 2009, and due to the high level of interest, did not close until 15 
December 2009. Regional focal points worked to encourage Member States to participate. In some cases 
this was easy; in others it required extensive discussions, not all of which were successful in achieving 
participation. Conducting a global survey is like conducting a campaign: the purpose and rewards of 
participation have to be conveyed to national coordinators and then to survey expert informants. It is 
important to build momentum and to maintain enthusiasm.
At the national level, coordinators managed the task. Their responsibilities included finding experts in all 
of the areas addressed by the survey, and organizing and hosting a full-day meeting where the survey 
could be collectively completed by the entire group. The number of expert informants, per country, 
ranged from 5 to 15. The survey process helps build the GOe network of informants around the globe and 
now consists of over 800 eHealth experts.
Limitations
Member States were limited to one response per country; thus, the expert informants were required to 
come up with a single response for each question that was most representative of the country as a whole. 
Coming to a consensus could be difficult in cases where the situation varies widely within the country, or 
where there were significant differences in opinion. The survey does not attempt to measure localized 
eHealth activity at the subnational level.
The survey responses were based on self-reporting by the expert informant group for each participating 
Member State. Although survey administrators were given detailed instructions to maintain consistency, 
there was significant variation across Member States in the quality and level of detail in the responses, 
particularly to for the descriptive, open-ended questions. While survey responses were checked for 
consistency and accuracy, it was not possible to verify the responses for every question.
The scope of the survey was broad, and survey questions covered diverse areas of eHealth – from policy 
issues and legal frameworks to specific types of eHealth initiatives being conducted in-country. Every 
effort was made to select the best national experts to complete the instrument; however, it is not possible 
to determine whether the focus groups had the collective eHealth knowledge to answer each question. 
While the survey was circulated with a set of detailed instructions and terminological definitions, there is 
no guarantee that these were used when responding.

Data processing
On receipt of the completed questionnaires, all non-English responses were translated into English. 
Survey responses were checked for consistency and other errors, and countries were contacted for 
follow-up to ensure accurate reporting of results. Data were exported from DataCol in Microsoft Excel 
format and the data analysis was performed using R statistical programming language.14  
Data were analysed by thematic section. For closed-ended questions, percentages were computed for 
each possible response to obtain the global level results. In addition, the data were aggregated and 
analysed by WHO region and World Bank income group to see trends by region and by income level. 
Preliminary analysis based on aggregation by ICT Development Index showed similar results as for World 
Bank income group (2). This is due to the high correlation between ICT Development Index and GDP 
per capita (Spearman ρ=0.93, p=10-16). Therefore, these results were not included in this report. Cross-
question analysis was performed where two or more questions were thought to be related, and the 
results were probed in greater depth as warranted. External health and technology indicators, such as 
mobile phone penetration, were introduced into the analysis for comparison purposes where relevant. 
Results from the current survey were compared to those from the previous survey wherever possible; 
however, as the subject matter covered by the 2009 survey was considerably broader, and the survey 
questions were worded somewhat differently, there was little scope for this sort of analysis. In addition, the 
percentages were often not directly comparable, particularly at the regional level, as the sets of responding 
countries were different, and the expert informants in each iteration of the survey were also different.
Table A2 shows the advantages and disadvantages of the groupings used in the survey.

Response rate by WHO region
Administratively WHO is made up of six geographical regions, which are quite heterogeneous: Member 
States differ with respect to size, economy, and health care challenges. Nevertheless, it is still important 
to present high-level eHealth analyses at the regional level as this reflects the organizational structure 
and operational framework of WHO.
A breakdown by WHO regional responses is presented in Table A3. It shows considerable variation ranging 
from 34% for the Americas to 73% for the South-East Asia Region. Numerous Member States, particularly 
those in the Region of the Americas, indicated that they would not be able to participate in the 2009 
survey due to resources being diverted to prepare and respond to the H1N1 pandemic or due to other 
urgent public health issues such as conflict situations. The Western-Pacific Region has many small island 
Member States of which only a few responded to the survey, yielding a response rate of 48% for the 
region. The response rates for the Eastern Mediterranean, African and European Regions were over 60%. 
This was particularly encouraging for regions consisting of a large number of Member States such as the 
African and European Regions. Results from regions with low response rates should be interpreted with 
care as they may not be representative of the entire region.

Table A3. Response rate by WHO region 
For the South-East Asia Region, although the number of responding countries was the lowest, the 
response rate was the highest since the region consists of a total of 11 Member States. Self-selection 
of the sample often occurs in surveys of this nature, where responding countries are more likely to have 
a high level of interest and/or activity in eHealth. Table A4 shows that response rates in low and lower-
middle income brackets were high. Past surveys have shown that countries in these groups generally 
have less eHealth activity in comparison to high and upper middle-income brackets. Thus, in some cases, 
Member States participating in the survey may reflect a commitment to moving forward with eHealth.

Response rate by World Bank income group
The World Bank classifies all economies with a population greater than 30 000 into four income groups 
based on gross national income (GNI) per capita.15  The classification is as follows: low income (US$ 975 or 
less), lower-middle income (US$ 976–3,855), upper-middle income (US$ 3856–11 905), and high income 
(US$ 11 906 or more). These income groups are a convenient and practical basis for analysis, enabling a 
review of trends in the survey results based on income level. Classification by income does not correspond 
exactly to level of development; however, low and middle-income countries are sometimes referred to as 
‘developing’ economies and high-income countries as ‘developed’, for convenience. 
Table A4 shows the survey response rate by World Bank income group. Low-income countries had the 
highest response rate (70%), closely followed by high-income countries (63%). In terms of raw numbers, 
the distribution of responding countries was remarkably even, with 30 to 31 countries responding from 
the high-income, lower-middle income, and low-income groups, and a slightly lower number of countries 
from the upper-middle income group.
