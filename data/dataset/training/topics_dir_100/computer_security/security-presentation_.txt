VIRUS
♦ A computer virus is a small 
program written to alter the 
way a computer operates, 
without the permission or 
knowledge of the user.
♦ A virus must meet two 
criteria:
♦ It must execute itself. It will 
often place its own code in 
the path of execution of 
another program.
♦ It must replicate itself. For 
example, it may replace 
other executable files with a 
copy of the virus infected file. 
Viruses can infect desktop 
computers and network 
servers alike.
4
VIRUS - DAMAGE
♦ Some viruses are programmed to damage the 
computer by damaging programs, deleting files, or 
reformatting the hard disk. Others are not designed to 
do any damage, but simply to replicate themselves 
and make their presence known by presenting text, 
video, and audio messages. Even these benign 
viruses can create problems for the computer user. 
They typically take up computer memory used by 
legitimate programs. As a result, they often cause 
erratic behavior and can result in system crashes. In 
addition, many viruses are bug-ridden, and these 
bugs may lead to system crashes and data loss.
5
WHAT IS NOT A VIRUS
♦ It is easy to blame any computer problem on a virus. The 
following are not likely to be caused by a virus or other malicious 
code:
♦ Hardware problems. There are no viruses that can physically 
damage computer hardware, such as chips, boards, and 
monitors.
♦ You have two antivirus programs installed and one of them 
reports a virus. While this could be a virus, it can also be 
caused by one antivirus program detecting the other program's 
signatures in memory.
6
WORMS
♦ Worms are programs that 
replicate themselves from 
system to system without 
the use of a host file. This 
is in contrast to viruses, 
which requires the 
spreading of an infected 
host file.
♦ Although worms generally 
exist inside of other files, often 
Word or Excel documents, 
there is a difference between 
how worms and viruses use 
the host file. Usually the worm 
will release a document that 
already has the "worm" macro 
inside the document. The 
entire document will then travel 
from computer to computer, so 
the entire document should be 
considered the worm.
7
TROJAN
♦ Trojan Horses are 
impostor files
♦ Files that claim to be 
something desirable 
but, in fact, are 
malicious. A very 
important distinction 
from true viruses is 
that they do not 
replicate themselves, 
as viruses do.
8
TROJAN - DAMAGE
♦ Trojans contain malicious code, that, when 
triggered, cause loss, or even theft, of data. In 
order for a Trojan Horse to spread, you must, 
in effect, invite these programs onto your 
computers -- for example, by opening an 
email attachment.
9
SPYWARE
♦ Spyware is a generic term for a class of software 
designed to gather information. Although software of 
this type can be legitimate, it can, in some cases, be 
installed on your computer without your knowledge. 
This poses privacy concerns for many people.
10
SPYWARE - PURPOSE
♦ The general purpose of spyware is to gather 
information about your Internet surfing habits and 
deliver that information to its customers.
♦ It can also gather information on the use of your 
personal computer and even the keystrokes entered 
into your computer’s keyboard.
11
SPYWARE – FORMS OF
♦ Spyware basically comes in, but is not confined to, 
three forms:
♦ As software bundled and installed with another 
software application,
♦ As a stand-alone installation package, 
♦ As a modification to the HTML of a Web page.
12
SPYWARE - DAMAGE
♦ Spyware programs, while they may be objectionable, 
are generally not malicious as far as damaging the 
computer. Most spyware programs have Web sites, 
and many of these sites have privacy statements or 
FAQs that explain what they do and what types of 
information they collect. This information can assist 
you in making an informed decision on whether to 
keep or uninstall the spyware.
13
SPYWARE - NOTES
♦ In many cases, when the spyware is installed with a 
utility or game you downloaded, you may have to 
uninstall the utility or game to uninstall the spyware. If 
you uninstall only the spyware, the utility or game 
may become unusable.
♦ Spyware is often bundled with free downloadable 
Internet programs such as Web browsers, browser 
enhancements, desktop utilities, browser theme 
packages, and games.
14
ADWARE
♦ Adware is a type of program that displays an 
advertisement of some sort, usually related to a 
specific Web site in your Web browser. In some 
cases, it changes the home page of your Web 
browser to point to a specific Web site.
15
ADWARE - INSTALLATION
♦ In most cases, some user interaction is required to 
install adware. You must either double-click the 
program to run it, or there is information on the Web 
site to inform you that it will install a program on your 
computer. (This information may not be obvious, 
however.)
♦ Because adware programs are not generally 
malicious, and are not viruses, worms, or Trojans, 
Most AntiVirus programs do not detect them as such.
16
ADWARE - DAMAGE
♦ Intrusion on “your computer” by an unknown 
third party,
♦ Annoying windows on desktop,
♦ Unwanted redirection to another website.
17
MESSENGER SERVICE
♦Operates over NetBIOS Ports – 135, 
136, & 137
♦All versions of Windows, and many 
other operating systems, use these 
ports in networking
18
MESSENGER SERVICE - USES
♦Most often used to deliver unwanted SPAM
♦Often used to try to “scare” the computer 
user into purchasing a program to protect 
the user from “viruses, etc” by saying your 
computer is unprotected
19
WHAT CAN I DO?
♦ Be aware of what is being installed on your 
computer, 
♦ Don’t automatically accept attachments in email,
♦ Disable “automatic download” in web browsers,
♦ Limit use of “JavaScript”, “ActiveX” & 
“Windows Scripting Host” in your web browsers.
♦ Turn off the messenger service if not needed or 
use a firewall or router to block those ports

WHERE CAN I GET MORE 
INFORMATION?
♦ Newsgroups:
♦ news.grc.com
♦ Your ISP’s newsgroup – i.e. ‘news.tyler.net’
22
HOW CAN I STOP THE 
INTRUSION?
♦AntiVirus (software)
♦AntiTrojan (software)
♦AntiSpyware/AntiAdware (software)
♦Router/Switch (hardware)
♦Firewall (software or hardware)
