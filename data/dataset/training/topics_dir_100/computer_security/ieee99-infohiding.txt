Abstract—Information hiding techniques have recently be-
come important in a number of application areas. Digital
audio, video, and pictures are increasingly furnished with
distinguishing but imperceptible marks, which may contain
a hidden copyright notice or serial number or even help to
prevent unauthorised copying directly. Military communi-
cations systems make increasing use of traffic security tech-
niques which, rather than merely concealing the content of
a message using encryption, seek to conceal its sender, its
receiver or its very existence. Similar techniques are used
in some mobile phone systems and schemes proposed for
digital elections. Criminals try to use whatever traffic se-
curity properties are provided intentionally or otherwise in
the available communications systems, and police forces try
to restrict their use. However, many of the techniques pro-
posed in this young and rapidly evolving field can trace their
history back to antiquity; and many of them are surpris-
ingly easy to circumvent. In this article, we try to give an
overview of the field; of what we know, what works, what
does not, and what are the interesting topics for research.
Keywords— Information hiding, steganography, copyright
marking.
I. Introduction
It is often thought that communications may be secured
by encrypting the traffic, but this has rarely been adequate
in practice. Æneas the Tactician, and other classical writ-
ers, concentrated on methods for hiding messages rather
than for enciphering them [1]; and although modern cryp-
tographic techniques started to develop during the Renais-
sance, we find in 1641 that John Wilkins still preferred
hiding over ciphering [2, IX pp. 67] because it arouses
less suspicion. This preference persists in many operational
contexts to this day. For example, an encrypted email mes-
sage between a known drug dealer and somebody not yet
under suspicion, or between an employee of a defence con-
tractor and the embassy of a hostile power, has obvious
implications.
So the study of communications security includes not
just encryption but also traffic security, whose essence lies
in hiding information. This discipline includes such tech-
nologies as spread spectrum radio, which is widely used
in tactical military systems to prevent transmitters being
located; temporary mobile subscriber identifiers, used in
digital phones to provide users with some measure of loca-
tion privacy; and anonymous remailers, which conceal the
identity of the sender of an email message [3].
An important subdiscipline of information hiding is ste-
ganography. While cryptography is about protecting the
content of messages, steganography is about concealing
their very existence. It comes from Greek roots (στεγανó-
ς, γραφ-ειν), literally means ‘covered writing’ [4], and is

usually interpreted to mean hiding information in other in-
formation. Examples include sending a message to a spy
by marking certain letters in a newspaper using invisible
ink, and adding sub-perceptible echo at certain places in
an audio recording.
Until recently, information hiding techniques received
much less attention from the research community and from
industry than cryptography, but this is changing rapidly
(table I), and the first academic conference on the sub-
ject was organised in 1996 [5]. The main driving force is
concern over copyright; as audio, video and other works be-
come available in digital form, the ease with which perfect
copies can be made may lead to large-scale unauthorised
copying, and this is of great concern to the music, film,
book, and software publishing industries. There has been
significant recent research into digital ‘watermarks’ (hid-
den copyright messages) and ‘fingerprints’ (hidden serial
numbers); the idea is that the latter can help to identify
copyright violators, and the former to prosecute them.
In another development, the DVD consortium has called
for proposals for a copyright marking scheme to enforce
serial copy management. The idea is that DVD players
available to consumers would allow unlimited copying of
home videos and time-shifted viewing of TV programmes,
but could not easily be abused for commercial piracy. The
proposal is that home videos would be unmarked, TV
broadcasts marked ‘copy once only’, and commercial videos
marked ‘never copy’; compliant consumer equipment would
act on these marks in the obvious way [7], [8].
There are a number of other applications driving interest
in the subject of information hiding (figure 1).
• Military and intelligence agencies require unobtrusive
communications. Even if the content is encrypted, the de-
tection of a signal on a modern battlefield may lead rapidly
to an attack on the signaller. For this reason, military com-
munications use techniques such as spread spectrum mod-
ulation or meteor scatter transmission to make signals hard
for the enemy to detect or jam.
• Criminals also place great value on unobtrusive com-
munications. Their preferred technologies include prepaid
mobile phones, mobile phones which have been modified
to change their identity frequently, and hacked corporate
switchboards through which calls can be rerouted.
• Law enforcement and counter intelligence agencies are
interested in understanding these technologies and their
weaknesses, so as to detect and trace hidden messages.
• Recent attempts by some governments to limit online free
speech and the civilian use of cryptography have spurred
people concerned about liberties to develop techniques for
anonymous communications on the net, including anony-
mous remailers and Web proxies.
• Schemes for digital elections and digital cash make use

of anonymous communication techniques.
• Marketeers use email forgery techniques to send out huge
numbers of unsolicited messages while avoiding responses
from angry users.
We will mention some more applications later. For the
time being, we should note that while the ethical positions
of the players in the cryptographic game are often thought
to be clear cut (the ‘good’ guys wish to keep their com-
munications private while the ‘bad’ eavesdropper wants to
listen in), the situation is much less clear when it comes to
hiding information. Legitimate users of the net may need
anonymous communications to contact abuse helplines or
vote privately in online elections [9]; but one may not want
to provide general anonymous communication mechanisms
that facilitate attacks by people who maliciously overload
the communication facilities. Industry may need tools to
hide copyright marks invisibly in media objects, yet these
tools can be abused by spies to pass on secrets hidden in in-
conspicuous data over public networks. Finally, there are a
number of non-competitive uses of the technology, such as
marking audio tracks with purchasing information so that
someone listening to a piece of music on his car radio could
simply press a button to order the CD.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Firstly, we
will clarify the terminology used for information hiding,
including steganography, digital watermarking and finger-
printing. Secondly we will describe a wide range of tech-
niques that have been used in a number of applications,
both ancient and modern, which we will try to juxtapose
in such a way that the common features become evident.
Then, we will describe a number of attacks against these
techniques; and finally, we will try to formulate general def-
initions and principles. Moving through the subject from
practice to theory may be the reverse of the usual order
of presentation, but appears appropriate to a discipline in
which rapid strides are being made constantly, and where
general theories are still very tentative.
II. Terminology
As we have noted previously, there has been a growing
interest, by different research communities, in the fields
of steganography, digital watermarking and fingerprinting.
This led to some confusion in the terminology. We shall
now briefly introduce the terminology which will be used
in the rest of the paper and which was agreed at the first
international workshop on the subject [5], [10] (figure 1).
The general model of hiding data in other data can be
described as follows. The embedded data is the message
that one wishes to send secretly. It is usually hidden in

Fig. 1. A classification of information hiding techniques based on
[10]. Many of the ancient systems presented in Sections III-A
and III-B are a form of ‘technical steganography’ (in the sense
that messages are hidden physically) and most of the recent ex-
amples given in this paper address ‘linguistic steganography’ and
‘copyright marking’.
an innocuous message referred to as a cover-text, or cover-
image or cover-audio as appropriate, producing the stego-
text or other stego-object. A stego-key is used to control the
hiding process so as to restrict detection and/or recovery
of the embedded data to parties who know it (or who know
some derived key value).
As the purpose of steganography is having a covert com-
munication between two parties whose existence is un-
known to a possible attacker, a successful attack consists
in detecting the existence of this communication. Copy-
right marking, as opposed to steganography, has the addi-
tional requirement of robustness against possible attacks.
In this context, the term ‘robustness’ is still not very clear;
it mainly depends on the application. Copyright marks do
not always need to be hidden, as some systems use visi-
ble digital watermarks [12], but most of the literature has
focussed on invisible (or transparent) digital watermarks
which have wider applications. Visible digital watermarks
are strongly linked to the original paper watermarks which
appeared at the end of the XIII century to differentiate
paper makers of that time [13] (figure 6). Modern visible
watermarks may be visual patterns (e.g., a company logo
or copyright sign) overlaid on digital images.
In the literature on digital marking, the stego-object is
usually referred to as the marked object rather than stego-
object. We may also qualify marks depending on the ap-
plication. Fragile watermarks1 are destroyed as soon as the
object is modified too much. This can be used to prove that
an object has not been ‘doctored’ and might be useful if
digital images are used as evidence in court. Robust marks
1Fragile watermarks have also wrongly been referred to as ‘signa-
ture’, leading to confusion with digital signatures used in cryptogra-
phy.
1063
have the property that it is infeasible to remove them or
make them useless without destroying the object at the
same time. This usually means that the mark should be
embedded in the most perceptually significant components
of the object [14].
Authors also make the distinction between various types
of robust marks. Fingerprints (also called labels by some
authors) are like hidden serial numbers which enable the in-
tellectual property owner to identify which customer broke
his license agreement by supplying the property to third
parties. Watermarks tell us who is the owner of the ob-
ject.
Figure 2 illustrates the generic embedding process.
Given an image I, a mark M and a key K (usually the seed
of a random number generator) the embedding process can
be defined as a mapping of the form: I × K × M → Ĩ and
is common to all watermarking methods.
The generic detection process is depicted in figure 3. Its
output is either the recovered mark M or some kind of
confidence measure indicating how likely it is for a given
mark at the input to be present in the image Ĩ ′ under
inspection.
There are several types of robust copyright marking sys-
tems. They are defined by their inputs and outputs:
• Private marking systems require at least the original im-
age. Type I systems, extract the mark M from the pos-
sibly distorted image Ĩ ′ and use the original image as a
hint to find where the mark could be in Ĩ ′. Type II sys-
tems (e.g., [15], [16], [17]) also require a copy of the em-
bedded mark for extraction and just yield a ‘yes’ or ‘no’
answer to the question: does Ĩ ′ contain the mark M?
(Ĩ ′ × I × K × M → {0, 1}). One might expect that this
kind of scheme will be more robust than the others since
it conveys very little information and requires access to se-
cret material [14]. Semi-private marking does not use the
original image for detection (Ĩ ′ × K × M → {0, 1}) but
answers the same question.
The main uses of private and semi-private marking seem to
be evidence in court to prove ownership and copy control in
applications such as DVD where the reader needs to know
whether it is allowed to play the content or not. Many of
the currently proposed schemes fall in this category [18],
[19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24].
• Public marking (also referred to as blind marking) re-
mains the most challenging problem since it requires nei-
ther the secret original I nor the embedded mark M . In-
deed such systems really extract n bits of information (the
mark) from the marked image: Ĩ ′ × K → M [25], [26],
[27], [28], [29]. Public marks have much more applications
than the others and we will focus our benchmark on these
systems. Indeed the embedding algorithms used in pub-
lic systems can usually be used in private ones, improving
robustness at the same time.
• There is also asymmetric marking (or public key marking)
which should have the property that any user can read the
mark, without being able to remove it.
In the rest of the paper, ‘watermark’ will refer to ‘digital
watermark’ unless said otherwise.

III. Steganographic techniques
We will now look at some of the techniques used to hide
information. Many of these go back to antiquity, but unfor-
tunately many modern system designers fail to learn from
the mistakes of their predecessors.
A. Security through obscurity
By the 16–17th centuries, there had arisen a large lit-
erature on steganography and many of the methods de-
pended on novel means of encoding information. In his
four hundred page book Schola Steganographica [30], Gas-
par Schott (1608–1666) explains how to hide messages in
music scores: each note corresponds to a letter (figure 4).
Another method, based on the number of occurrences of
notes and used by J. S. Bach, is mentioned in [11]. Schott
also expands the ‘Ave Maria’ code proposed by Johannes
Trithemius (1462–1516) in Steganographiæ, one of the first
known books in the field. The expanded code uses forty
tables, each of which contains 24 entries (one for each let-
ter of the alphabet of that time) in four languages: Latin,
German, Italian and French. Each letter of the plain-text
is replaced by the word or phrase that appears in the corre-
sponding table entry and the stego-text ends up looking like
a prayer or a magic spell. It has been shown recently that
these tables can be deciphered by reducing them modulo
25 and applying them to a reversed alphabet [31]. In [2],
John Wilkins (1614–1672), Master of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge, shows how ‘two Musicians may discourse with one
another by playing upon their instruments of musick as well
as by talking with their instruments of speech’ [2, XVIII,
pp. 143–150]. He also explains how one can hide secretly
a message into a geometric drawing using points, lines or
triangles. ‘The point, the ends of the lines and the angles
of the figures do each of them by their different situation
express a several letter’ [2, XI, pp. 88–96].
A very widely used method is the acrostic. In his book,
The Codebreakers [32], David Kahn explains how a monk
wrote a book and put his lover’s name in the first letters of
successive chapters. He also tells of prisoners of war who

not try to play the music [29, p. 322].
hid messages in letters home using the dots and dashes
on i, j, t and f to spell out a hidden text in Morse code.
These ‘semagrams’ concealed messages but have an inher-
ent problem, that the cover-text tends to be laborious to
construct and often sounds odd enough to alert the censor.
During both World Wars, censors intercepted many such
messages. A famous one, from World War I, was a cable-
gram saying ‘Father is dead’ which the censor modified into
‘Father is deceased’. The reply was a giveaway: ‘Is Father
dead or deceased?’ [32, pp. 515–516].
Although steganography is different from cryptography,
we can borrow many of the techniques and much practical
wisdom from the latter, more thoroughly researched dis-
cipline. In 1883, Auguste Kerckhoffs enunciated the first
principles of cryptographic engineering, in which he ad-
vises that we assume the method used to encipher data is
known to the opponent, so security must lie only in the
choice of key2 [33]. The history of cryptology since then
has repeatedly shown the folly of ‘security-by-obscurity’ –
the assumption that the enemy will remain ignorant of the
system in use.
Applying this wisdom, we obtain a tentative definition
of a secure stego-system: one where an opponent who un-
derstands the system, but does not know the key, can ob-
tain no evidence (or even grounds for suspicion) that a
communication has taken place. In other words, no in-
formation about the embedded text can be obtained from
knowledge of the stego (and perhaps also cover) texts. We
will revisit this definition later, to take account of robust-
ness and other issues; but it will remain a central prin-
ciple that steganographic processes intended for wide use
should be published, just like commercial cryptographic al-
gorithms and protocols. This teaching of Kerckhoffs holds
with particular force for marking techniques intended for
use in evidence, which implies their disclosure in court [34].
That any of the above ‘security-by-obscurity’ systems
ever worked was a matter of luck. Yet many steganographic
2Il faut qu’il n’exige pas le secret, et qu’il puisse sans inconvénient
tomber entre les mains de l’ennemi. [33, p. 12]
systems available today just embed the ‘hidden’ data in
the least significant bits of an audio or video file – which is
trivial for a capable opponent to detect and remove.
B. Camouflage
The situation may be improved by intelligent use of ca-
mouflage. Even if the method is known in principle, mak-
ing the hidden data expensive to look for can be beneficial,
especially where there is a large amount of cover traffic.
Since the early days of architecture, artists have under-
stood that works of sculpture or painting appear differ-
ent from certain angles, and established rules for perspec-
tive and anamorphosis [35]. Through the 16th and 17th
centuries anamorphic images supplied an ideal means of
camouflaging dangerous political statements and heretical
ideas [36]. A masterpiece of hidden anamorphic imagery
– the Vexierbild – was created in the 1530s by Shö, a
Nürnberg engraver, pupil of Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528):
when one looks at it normally one sees a strange landscape,
but looking from the side reveals portraits of famous kings.
In his Histories [37], Herodotus (c.486–425 B.C.) tells
how around 440 B.C. Histiæus shaved the head of his most
trusted slave and tattooed it with a message which disap-
peared after the hair had regrown. The purpose was to
instigate a revolt against the Persians. Astonishingly the
method was still used by some German spies at the be-
ginning of the 20th century [38]. Herodotus also tells how
Demeratus, a Greek at the Persian court, warned Sparta of
an imminent invasion by Xerxes: he removed the wax from
a writing tablet, wrote his message on the wood underneath
and then covered the message with wax. The tablet looked
exactly like a blank one (it almost fooled the recipient as
well as the customs men).
A large number of techniques were invented or reported
by Æneas the Tactician [1], including letters hidden in mes-
sengers’ soles or women’s ear-rings, text written on wood
tablets and then whitewashed, and notes carried by pi-
geons. The centerpiece is a scheme for winding thread
through 24 holes bored in an astragal: each hole represents
a letter and a word is represented by passing the thread
through the corresponding letters. He also proposed hid-
ing text by making very small holes above or below letters
or by changing the heights of letter-strokes in a cover text.
These dots were masked by the contrast between the black
letters and the white paper. This technique was still in
use during the 17th century, but was improved by Wilkins
who used invisible ink to print very small dots instead of
making holes [2] and was reused by German spies during
both World Wars [32, p. 83]. A modern adaptation of this
technique is still in use for document security [39].
Invisible inks were used extensively. They were originally
made of available organic substances (such as milk or urine)
or ‘salt armoniack dissolved in water’ [2, V, pp. 37–47] and
developed with heat; progress in chemistry helped to create
more sophisticated combinations of ink and developer by
the first World War, but the technology fell into disuse with
the invention of ‘universal developers’ which could deter-
mine which parts of a piece of paper had been wetted from

the effects on the surfaces of the fibres [32, pp. 523–525].
Nowadays, in the field of currency security, special inks
or materials with particular structure (such as fluorescent
dyes or DNA) are used to write a hidden message on bank
notes or other secure documents. These materials provide
a unique response to some particular excitation such as a
reagent or laser light at a particular frequency [40].
By 1860 the basic problems of making tiny images had
been solved [41]. In 1857, Brewster suggested hiding secret
messages ‘in spaces not larger than a full stop or small dot
of ink’ [42]. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871,
while Paris was besieged, messages on microfilm were sent
out by pigeon post [43], [44]. During the Russo-Japanese
war of 1905, microscopic images were hidden in ears, nos-
trils, and under finger nails [41]. By World War I messages
to and from spies were reduced to microdots by several
stages of photographic reduction and then stuck on top
of printed periods or commas in innocuous cover material
such as magazines [38], [45].
The digital equivalent of these camouflage techniques is
the use of masking algorithms [17], [27], [46], [47], [48].
Like most source-coding techniques (e.g., [49]), these rely
on the properties of the human perceptual system. Au-
dio masking, for instance, is a phenomenon in which one
sound interferes with our perception of another sound [50].
Frequency masking occurs when two tones which are close
in frequency are played at the same time: the louder tone
will mask the quieter one. Temporal masking occurs when
a low-level signal is played immediately before or after a
stronger one; after a loud sound stops, it takes a little while
before we can hear a weak tone at a nearby frequency.
Because these effects are used in compression standards
such as MPEG [51], many systems shape the embedded
data to emphasise it in the perceptually most significant
components of the data so it will survive compression [27],
[47] (figure 5). This idea is also applied in buried data
channels where the regular channels of an audio CD contain
other embedded sound channels [52]; here, an optimised
noise shaper is used to reduce to minimise the effect of the
embedded signal on the quality of the cover music.
For more details about the use of perceptual models in
digital watermarking, the reader is referred to [53].
C. Hiding the location of the embedded information
In a security protocol developed in ancient China, the
sender and the receiver had copies of a paper mask with a
number of holes cut at random locations. The sender would
place his mask over a sheet of paper, write the secret mes-
sage into the holes, remove the mask and then compose a
cover message incorporating the code ideograms. The re-
ceiver could read the secret message at once by placing his
mask over the resulting letter. In the early 16th century
Cardan (1501–1576), an Italian mathematician, reinvented
this method which is now known as the Cardan grille. It
appears to have been reinvented again in 1992 by a British
bank, which recommended that its customers conceal the
personal information number used with their cash machine
card using a similar system. In this case, a poor implemen-
tation made the system weak [54].
A variant on this theme is to mark an object by the pres-
ence of errors or stylistic features at predetermined points
in the cover material. An early example was a technique
used by Francis Bacon (1561–1626) in his biliterarie alpha-
bet [55, pp. 266], which seems to be linked to the con-
troversy whether he wrote the works attributed to Shake-
speare [56]. In this method each letter is encoded in a five
bit binary code and embedded in the cover-text by printing
the letters in either normal or italic fonts. The variability
of sixteenth century typography acted as camouflage.
Further examples come from the world of mathematical
tables. Publishers of logarithm tables and astronomical
ephemerides in the 17th and 18th century used to introduce
errors deliberately in the least significant digits (e.g., [57]).
To this day, database and mailing list vendors insert bogus
entries in order to identify customers who try to resell their
products.
In an electronic publishing pilot project copyright mes-
sages and serial numbers have been hidden in the line spac-
ing and other format features of documents (e.g., [58]). It
was found that shifting text lines up or down by one-three-
hundredth of an inch to encode zeros and ones was robust
against multi-generation photocopying and could not be
noticed by most people.
However, the main application area of current copyright
marking proposals, lies in digital representations of ana-
logue objects such as audio, still pictures, video and mul-
timedia generally. Here there is considerable scope for em-
bedding data by introducing various kinds of error. As
we noted above, many writers have proposed embedding
the data in the least significant bits [23], [59]. An obvi-
ously better technique, which has occurred independently
to many writers, is to embed the data into the least signif-
icant bits of pseudo-randomly chosen pixels or sound sam-
ples [60], [61]. In this way, the key for the pseudo-random
sequence generator becomes the stego-key for the system
and Kerckhoffs’ principle is observed.
1066
Many implementation details need some care. For exam-
ple, one might not wish to disturb a pixel in a large expanse
of flat colour, or lying on a sharp edge; for this reason, a
prototype digital camera designed to enable spies to hide
encrypted reports in snapshots used a pseudo-random se-
quence generator to select candidate pixels for embedding
bits of cipher-text and then rejected those candidates where
the local variance of luminosity was either too high or too
low.
One scheme that uses bit-tweaking in a novel way is
Chameleon. Ideally, all distributed copies of a copyright
work should be fingerprinted, but in applications such as
pay-TV or CD, the broadcast or mass production nature
of the medium appears to preclude this. Chameleon al-
lows a single ciphertext to be broadcast while subscribers
are given slightly different deciphering keys, which produce
slightly different plaintexts. The system can be tuned so
that the deciphered signal is only marked in a sparse sub-
set of its least significant bits, and this may produce an
acceptably low level of distortion for digital audio. The
precise mechanism involves modifying a stream cipher to
reduce the diffusion of part of its key material [62].
Systems that involve bit-twiddling have a common vul-
nerability, that even very simple digital filtering operations
will disturb the value of many of the least significant bits
of a digital object. This leads us to consider ways in which
bit tweaking can be made robust against filtering.
D. Spreading the hidden information
The obvious solution is to consider filtering operations
as the introduction of noise in the embedded data chan-
nel [63], and to use suitable coding techniques to exploit
the residual bandwidth. The simplest is the repetition code
– one simply embeds a bit enough times in the cover object
that evidence of it will survive the filter. This is inefficient
in coding theoretic terms but can be simple and robust in
some applications.
Another way to spread the information is to embed it
into the statistics of the luminance of the pixels, such
as [64], [65]. Patchwork [64], for instance, uses a pseu-
dorandom generator to select n pairs of pixels and slightly
increases or decrease their luminosity contrast. Thus the
contrast of this set is increased without any change in the
average luminosity of the image. With suitable param-
eters, Patchwork even survives compression using JPEG.
However, it embeds only one bit of information. To embed
more, one can first split the image into pieces and then
apply the embedding to each of them [28], [66].
These statistical methods give a kind of primitive spread
spectrum modulation. General spread spectrum systems
encode data in the choice of a binary sequence that appears
like noise to an outsider but which a legitimate receiver,
furnished with an appropriate key, can recognise. Spread
spectrum radio techniques have been developed for mili-
tary applications since the mid-1940’s because of their anti-
jamming and low-probability-of-intercept properties [67],
[68], [69]; they allow the reception of radio signals that are
over 100 times weaker than the atmospheric background
noise.
Tirkel et al. were the first to note that spread spectrum
techniques could be applied to digital watermarking [70]
and later a number of researchers have developed stegano-
graphic techniques based on spread spectrum ideas which
take advantage of the large bandwidth of the cover medium
by matching the narrow bandwidth of the embedded data
to it (e.g., [63], [71], [72], [47]).
In [16], Cox et al. present an image watermarking
method in which the mark is embedded in the n most per-
ceptually significant frequency components V = {vi}ni=1
of an image’s discrete cosine transform to provide greater
robustness to JPEG compression. The watermark is a
sequence of real numbers W = {wi}ni=1 drawn from a
Gaussian distribution, and is inserted using the formula
ṽi = vi(1+αwi). If I is the original image and Ĩ the water-
marked image, that is the image whose main components
have been modified, the presence of the watermark is veri-
fied by extracting the main components of I and those with
same index from Ĩ and inverting the embedding formula to
give a possibly modified watermark W ′. The watermark
is said to be present in Ĩ if the ratio W · W ′/√W ′ · W ′ is
greater than a given threshold.
The authors claim that O(
√
n/ ln n) similar watermarks
must be added before they destroy the original mark. This
method is very robust against rescaling, JPEG compres-
sion, dithering, clipping, printing/scanning, and collusion
attacks. However it has some drawbacks. Most seriously,
the original image is needed to check for the presence of a
watermark.
The second problem is the low information rate. Like
Patchwork, this scheme hides a single bit and is thus
suitable for watermarking rather than fingerprinting or
steganographic communication. The information rate of
such schemes can again be improved by placing separate
marks in the image, but at a cost of reduced robustness.
Information hiding schemes that operate in a transform
space are increasingly common, as this can aid robustness
against compression, other common filtering operations,
and noise. Actually one can observe that the use of a par-
ticular transform gives good results against compression
algorithms based on the same transform.
Some schemes operate directly on compressed objects
(e.g., [72]). Some, steganographic tools, for example, hide
information in gif [73] files by swapping the colours of
selected pixels for colours that are adjacent in the current
palette [74]. Another example is MP3Stego [75] which hides
information in MPEG Audio Layer III bitstreams [51] dur-
ing the compression process. However, most schemes op-
erate directly on the components of some transform of the
cover object like discrete cosine transform [16], [17], [18],
[76], [77], [78], wavelet transforms [17], [79], and the dis-
crete Fourier transform [47], [80].
A novel transform coding technique is echo hiding [81],
which relies on the fact that we cannot perceive short
echoes (of the order of a millisecond). It embeds data into
a cover audio signal by introducing two types of short echo
with different delays to encode zeros and ones. These bits

bridge area (c.1550). At that time, watermarks were mainly used

sity Archives. Reproduction technique: beta radiography.
are encoded at locations separated by spaces of pseudo-
random length. The cepstral transform [82] is used to ma-
nipulate the echo signals.
E. Techniques specific to the environment
Echo hiding leads naturally to the broader topic of in-
formation hiding techniques that exploit features of a par-
ticular application environment. One technology that is
emerging from the military world is meteor burst commu-
nication, which uses the transient radio paths provided by
ionised trails of meteors entering the atmosphere to send
data packets between a mobile station and a base [83]. The
transient nature of these paths makes it hard for an enemy
to locate mobiles using radio direction finding, and so me-
teor burst is used in some military networks.
More familiar application-specific information hiding
and marking technologies are found in the world of secu-
rity printing. Watermarks in paper are a very old anti-
counterfeiting technique (figure 6); more recent innovations
include special ultra-violet fluorescent inks used in printing
travellers’ cheques. As the lamps used in photocopiers have
a high UV content, it can be arranged that photocopies
come out overprinted with ‘void’ in large letters. Inks may
also be reactive; one of the authors has experience of trav-
ellers’ cheques coming out ‘void’ after exposure to perspi-
ration in a money belt. Recent developments address the
problem of counterfeiting with scanners and printers whose
capabilities have improved dramatically over the last few
years [84].
Many other techniques are used. For a survey of op-
tically variable devices, such as diffraction products and
thin film interference coatings, see [85]; the design of the
US currency is described in [86], [87]; and the security fea-
tures of the Dutch passport in [88]. Such products tend to
combine overt marks that are expensive to reproduce (holo-
grams, kinegrams, intaglios and optically variable inks)
with tamper-evidence features (such as laminates and reac-
tive inks) and secondary features whose presence may not
be obvious (such as micro-printing, diffraction effects visi-
ble only under special illumination, and alias band struc-
tures – dithering effects that normal scanners cannot cap-
ture), [89], [90]. In a more recent application called sub-
graving, variable information (such as a serial number) is
printed on top of a uniform offset background. The printed
area is then exposed to an excimer laser: this removes the
offset ink everywhere but underneath the toner. Fraudu-
lent removal of the toner by a solvent reveals the hidden
ink [91].
Increasingly, features are incorporated that are designed
to be verified by machines rather than humans. Marks can
be embedded in the magnetic strips of bank cards, giving
each card a unique serial number that is hard to repro-
duce [92]; they are used in phone cards too in some coun-
tries. Magnetic fibres can be embedded randomly in paper
or cardboard, giving each copy of a document a unique
fingerprint.
The importance of these technologies is not limited to
protecting currency and securities. Forgery of drugs, vehi-
cle spares, computer software and other branded products
is said to have cost over $24 billions in 1995, and to have
directly caused over 100 deaths worldwide [93]. Security
printing techniques are a significant control measure, al-
though many fielded sealing products could be much bet-
ter designed given basic attention to simple issues such as
choice of pressure-sensitive adhesives and nonstandard ma-
terials [94]. Fashion designers are also concerned that their
product might be copied and wish to find techniques to
enable easy detection of counterfeit clothes or bags. As
a greater percentage of the gross world product comes in
the form of digital objects, the digital marking techniques
described here may acquire more economic significance.
Also important are covert channels: communication
paths that were neither designed nor intended to trans-
fer information at all. Common examples include timing
variations and error messages in communication protocols
and operating system call interfaces [95], [96]. Covert chan-
nels are of particular concern in the design and evaluation
of mandatory access control security concepts, where the
operating system attempts to restrict the flow of informa-
tion between processes in order to protect the user from
computer viruses and Trojan horse software that transmits
secrets to third parties without authorization.
The electromagnetic radiation produced by computers
forms another covert channel. It not only interferes with
reception on nearby radio receivers, but can also convey in-
formation. For instance, the video signal emitted by CRT
or liquid-crystal displays can be reconstructed using a sim-
ple modified TV set at several hundred meters distance [97].
Many military organizations use especially shielded ‘Tem-
pest’ certified equipment to process classified information,
in order to eliminate the risk of losing secrets via compro-
1068
mising emanations [98].
We have shown in [99] how software can hide informa-
tion in video screen content in a form that is invisible to
the user but that can easily be reconstructed with modified
TV receivers. More sophisticated ways of broadcasting in-
formation covertly from PC software use spread spectrum
techniques to embed information in the video signal or CPU
bus activity.
It is possible to write a virus that searches a computer’s
hard disk for crypto-key material or other secrets, and
proceeds to radiate them covertly. The same techniques
could also be used in software copyright protection: soft-
ware could transmit its license serial number while in use,
and software trade associations could send detector vans
round business districts and other neighbourhoods where
piracy is suspected – just like the ‘TV detector vans’ used in
countries with a mandatory TV license fee. If multiple sig-
nals are then received simultaneously with the same serial
number but with spreading sequences at different phases,
this proves that software purchased under a single license
is being used concurrently on different computers, and can
provide the evidence to obtain a search warrant.
IV. Limitations of some information hiding
systems
A number of broad claims have been made about the
‘robustness’ of various digital watermarking or fingerprint-
ing methods. Unfortunately the robustness criteria and
the sample pictures used to demonstrate it vary from one
system to the other, and recent attacks [100], [101], [102],
[103], [104] show that the robustness criteria used so far
are often inadequate. JPEG compression, additive Gaus-
sian noise, low pass filtering, rescaling, and cropping have
been addressed in most of the literature but specific distor-
tions such as rotation have often been ignored [80], [105].
In some cases the watermark is simply said to be ‘robust
against common signal processing algorithms and geomet-
ric distortions when used on some standard images’. This
motivated the introduction of a fair benchmark for digital
image watermarking in [107].
Similarly, various steganographic systems have shown se-
rious limitations [108].
Craver et al. [109] identify at least three kinds of at-
tacks: robustness attacks which aim to diminish or remove
the presence of a digital watermark, presentation attacks
which modify the content such that the detector cannot
find the watermark anymore (e.g., the Mosaic attack, see
section IV-C) and the interpretation attacks whereby an
attacker can devise a situation which prevents assertion of
ownership. The separation between these groups is not
always very clear though; for instance, StirMark (see sec-
tion IV-B.1) both diminishes the watermark and distort
the content to fool the detector.
As examples of these, we present in this section sev-
eral attacks which reveal significant limitations of various
marking systems. We will develop a general attack based
on simple signal processing, plus specialised techniques for
some particular schemes, and show that even if a copyright
marking system were robust against signal processing, bad
engineering can provide other avenues of attacks.
A. Basic attack
Most simple spread spectrum based techniques and some
simple image stego software are subject to some kind of jit-
ter attack [102]. Indeed, although spread spectrum signals
are very robust to amplitude distortion and to noise addi-
tion, they do not survive timing errors: synchronisation of
the chip signal is very important and simple systems fail to
recover this synchronisation properly. There are more sub-
tle distortions that can be applied. For instance, in [110],
Hamdy et al. present a way to increase or decrease the
length of a musical performance without changing its pitch;
this was developed to enable radio broadcasters to slightly
adjust the playing time of a musical track. As such tools
become widely available, attacks involving sound manipu-
lation will become easy.
B. Robustness attacks
B.1 StirMark
After evaluating some watermarking software, it became
clear to us that although most schemes could survive basic
manipulations – that is, manipulations that can be done
easily with standard tools, such as rotation, shearing, re-
sampling, resizing and lossy compression – they would not
cope with combinations of them or with random geometric
distortions. This motivated the design of StirMark [102].
StirMark is a generic tool for basic robustness testing of
image watermarking algorithms and has been freely avail-
able since November 1997.3 It applies a minor unnotice-
able geometric distortion: the image is slightly stretched,
sheared, shifted, bent and rotated by an unnoticeable ran-
dom amount. A slight random low frequency deviation,
which is greatest at the centre of the picture, is applied to
each pixel. A higher frequency displacement of the form
λ sin(ωxx) sin(ωyy) + n(x, y) – where n(x, y) is a random
number – is also added. Finally a transfer function that
introduces a small and smoothly distributed error into all
sample values is applied. This emulates the small non-
linear analogue/digital converter imperfections typically
found in scanners and display devices. Resampling uses
the approximating quadratic B-spline algorithm [111]. An
example of these distortions is given in figure 7.
StirMark can also perform a default series of tests which
serve as a benchmark for image watermarking [107]. Digi-
tal watermarking remains a largely untested field and very
few authors have published extensive tests on their systems
(e.g., [112]). A benchmark is needed to highlight promising
areas of research by showing which techniques work better
than others.
One might try to increase the robustness of a watermark-
ing system by trying to foresee the possible transforms used
by pirates; one might then use techniques such as embed-
ding multiple versions of the mark under suitable inverse

transforms; for instance O’Ruanaidh et al. [80] suggest us-
ing the Fourier-Mellin transform.
However, the general lesson from this attack is that given
a target marking scheme, one can invent a distortion (or
a combination of distortions) that will prevent detection
of the watermark while leaving the perceptual value of the
previously watermarked object undiminished. We are not
limited in this process to the distortions produced by com-
mon analogue equipment, or usually applied by end users
with common image processing software. Moreover, the
quality requirements of pirates are often lower than those
of content owners who have to decide how much quality
degradation to tolerate in return for extra protection of-
fered by embedding a stronger signal. It is an open ques-
tion whether there is any digital watermarking scheme for
which a chosen distortion attack cannot be found.
B.2 Attack on echo hiding
As mentioned above, echo hiding encodes zeros and ones
by adding echo signals distinguished by two different values
for their delay τ and their relative amplitude α to a cover
audio signal. The delays are chosen between 0.5 and 2 ms,
and the relative amplitude is around 0.8 [81]. According
to its creators, decoding involves detecting the initial delay
and the auto-correlation of the cepstrum of the encoded
signal is used for this purpose. However the same technique
can be used for an attack.
The ‘obvious’ attack on this scheme is to detect the echo
and then remove it by simply inverting the convolution for-
mula; the problem is to detect the echo without knowledge
of either the original object or the echo parameters. This is
known as ‘blind echo cancellation’ in the signal processing
literature and is known to be a hard problem in general.
We tried several methods to remove the echo. Frequency
invariant filtering [113], [114] was not very successful. In-
stead we used a combination of cepstrum analysis and
‘brute force’ search.
The underlying idea of cepstrum analysis is presented
in [82]. Suppose that we are given a signal y(t)
which contains a simple single echo, i.e. y(t) = x(t) +
αx(t − τ). If Φxx denotes the power spectrum of x then
Φyy(f) = Φxx(f)(1 + 2α cos(2πfτ) + α2) whose logarithm
log Φyy(f) ≈ log Φxx(f) + 2α cos(2πfτ). Taking its power
spectrum raises its ‘quefrency’ τ , that is the frequency of
cos(2πτf) as a function of f . The auto-covariance of this
later function emphasises the peak that appears at ‘que-
frency’ τ .
We need a method to detect the echo delay τ in a signal.
For this, we used a slightly modified version of the cep-
strum: C ◦ Φ ◦ ln ◦Φ, where C is the auto-covariance func-
tion (C(x) = E((x − x)(x − x)∗)), Φ the power spectrum
density function and ◦ the composition operator. Exper-
iments on random signals as well as on music show that
this method returns quite accurate estimators of the delay
when an artificial echo has been added to the signal. In the
detection function we only consider echo delays between 0.5
and 3 ms (below 0.5 ms the function does not work properly
and above 3 ms the echo becomes too audible).
Our first attack was to remove an echo with random rela-
tive amplitude, expecting that this would introduce enough
modification in the signal to prevent watermark recovery.
Since echo hiding gives best results for α greater than 0.7
we could use α̂ – an estimator of α – drawn from, say a nor-
mal distribution centred on 0.8. It was not really successful
so our next attack was to iterate: we re-applied the detec-
tion function and varied α̂ to minimise the residual echo.
We could obtain successively better estimates of the echo
parameters and then remove this echo. When the detection
function cannot detect any more echo, we have found the
correct value of α̂ (as this gives the lowest output value of
the detection function).
B.3 Other generic attacks
Some generic attacks attempt to estimate the watermark
and then remove it. Langelaar et al. [103], for instance,
present an attack on white spread spectrum watermarks.
They try different methods to model the original image
and apply this model to the watermarked image Ĩ = I +W
to separate it into two components: an estimated image Î
and an estimated watermark Ŵ such that the watermark
W does not appear anymore in Î, giving ρ(Î , W ) ≈ 0. The
authors show that a 3×3 median filter gives the best results.
However an amplified version of the estimated watermark
needs to be substracted because the low frequency com-
ponents of the watermark cannot be estimated accuratly,
leading to a positive contribution of the low frequencies and
a negative contribution of the high frequencies to the cor-
1070
relation. Only a choice of good amplification parameters
can zero the correlation.
In some cases the image to be marked has certain fea-
tures that help a malicious attacker to gain information
about the mark itself. An example of such features is where
a picture, such as a cartoon, has only a small number of dis-
tinct colours, giving sharp peaks in the colour histogram.
These are split by some marking algorithms. The twin
peaks attack, suggested by Maes [101], takes advantage of
this to recover and remove marks. In the case of grayscale
images, a simple example of digital watermarking based on
spread spectrum ideas is to add or substract randomly a
fixed value d to each pixel value. So each pixel’s value has
a 50% chance of being increased or decreased. Let nk be
the number of pixels with gray value k and suppose that
for a particular gray value k0 the dth neighboring colours
do not occur, so nk0−d = nk0+d = 0. Consequently, the
expected numbers of occurencies after watermarking are:
ñk0−d = ñk0+d = nk0/2 and ñk0 = 0. Hence, using a set of
similar equations, it is possible in certain cases, to recover
the original distribution of the histogram and the value of
the embedded watermark.
C. The mosaic attack
There is a presentation attack which is quite general and
which possesses the initially remarkable property that we
can remove the marks from an image and still have it ren-
dered exactly the same, pixel for pixel, as the marked image
by a standard browser.
It was motivated by a fielded system for copyright piracy
detection, consisting of a watermarking scheme plus a web
crawler that downloads pictures from the net and checks
whether they contain a client’s watermark.
Our mosaic attack consists of chopping an image up into
a number of smaller subimages, which are embedded one
after another in a web page. Common web browsers render
juxtaposed subimages stuck together as a single image, so
the result is identical to the original image. This attack
appears to be quite general; all marking schemes require
the marked image to have some minimal size (one cannot
hide a meaningful mark in just one pixel). Thus by splitting
an image into sufficiently small pieces, the mark detector
will be confused [102]. One defence would be to ensure
that the minimal size would be quite small and the mosaic
attack might therefore not be very practical.
But there are other problems with such ‘crawlers’. Mo-
bile code such as Java applets can be used to display a pic-
ture inside the browser; the applet could de-scramble the
picture in real time. Defeating such techniques would entail
rendering the whole page, detecting pictures and checking
whether they contain a mark. Another problem is that
pirated pictures are typically sold via many small web ser-
vices, from which the crawler would have to purchase them
using a credit card before it could examine them.
D. Interpretation attacks
StirMark and our attack on echo hiding are examples of
the kind of threat that dominates the information hiding
literature – namely, a pirate who removes the mark directly
using technical means. Indeed, the definition commonly
used for robustness includes only resistance to signal ma-
nipulation (cropping, scaling, resampling, etc.). However,
Craver et al. show that this is not enough by exhibiting a
‘protocol’ level attack in [115].
The basic idea is that as many schemes provide no intrin-
sic way of detecting which of two watermarks was added
first. If the owner of the document d encodes a watermark
w, publishes the marked version d + w and has no other
proof of ownership, then a pirate who has registered his wa-
termark as w′ can claim that the document is his and that
the original unmarked version of it was d + w − w′. Their
paper [116] extends this idea to defeat a scheme which is
non-invertible (an inverse needs only be approximated).
Craver et al. argue for the use of information-losing
marking schemes whose inverses cannot be approximated
closely enough. Our alternative interpretation of their at-
tack is that watermarking and fingerprinting methods must
be used in the context of a larger system that may use
mechanisms such as timestamping and notarisation to pre-
vent attacks of this kind.
Environmental constraints may also limit the amount of
protection which technical mechanisms can provide. For
example, there is little point in using an anonymous digital
cash system to purchase goods over the Internet, if the pur-
chaser’s identity is given away in the headers of his email
message or if the goods are shipped to his home address.
E. Implementation considerations
The robustness of embedding and retrieving algorithms
and their supporting protocols is not the only issue. Most
real attacks on fielded cryptographic systems have come
from the opportunistic exploitation of loopholes that were
found by accident; cryptanalysis was rarely used, even
against systems that were vulnerable to it [54].
We cannot expect copyright marking systems to be any
different and the pattern was followed in the first attack
to be made available on the Internet against one of the
most widely used picture marking schemes. This attack
exploited weaknesses in the implementation rather than in
the underlying marking algorithms, even although these
are weak (the marks can be removed with StirMark).
Each user has an ID and a two-digit password, which
are issued when he registers with the marking service and
pays a subscription. The correspondence between IDs and
passwords is checked using obscure software and, although
the passwords are short enough to be found by trial and er-
ror, the published attack first uses a debugger to break into
the software and disable the password checking mechanism.
As IDs are public, either password search or disassembly
enables any user to be impersonated.
A deeper examination of the program allows a villain to
change the ID, and thus the copyright mark, of an already
marked image as well as the type of use (such as adult
versus general public content). Before embedding a mark,
the program checks whether there is already a mark in the
picture, but this check can be bypassed fairly easily using
1071
the debugger with the result that it is possible to overwrite
any existing mark and replace it with another one.
Exhaustive search for the personal code can be prevented
without difficulty, but there is no obvious solution to the
disassembly attack. If tamper resistant software [117] can-
not give enough protection, then one can always have an
online system in which each user shares a secret stego-key
with a trusted party and uses this key to embed some kind
of digital signature. Observe that there are two separate
keyed operations here; the authentication (such as a digital
signature) and the embedding or hiding operation.
Although we can do public key steganography – hiding
information using a public key so that only someone with
the corresponding private key can detect its existence [118]
– we still do not know how to do the hiding equivalent of a
digital signature; that is, to enable someone with a private
key to embed marks in such a way that anyone with the
corresponding public key can read them but not remove
them. Some attempts to create such watermarks can be
found in [119]. But unless we have some new ideas, we
appear compelled to use either a central ‘mark reading’
service or a tamper-resistant implementation, just as cryp-
tography required either central notarisation or tamper-
evident devices to provide a non-repudiation service in the
days before the invention of digital signatures.
However, there is one general attack on tamper-resistant
mark readers due to Cox et al. [120]. The idea is to ex-
plore, pixel by pixel, an image at the boundary where the
detector changes from ‘mark absent’ to ‘mark present’ and
iteratively construct an acceptable image in which the mark
is not detected. Of course, with a programmable tamper-
proof processor, one can limit the number of variants of a
given picture for which an answer will be given, and the
same holds for a central mark reading service. But in the
absence of physically protected state, it is unclear how this
attack can be blocked.
V. A basic theory of steganography
This leads naturally to the question of whether we can
develop a comprehensive theory of information hiding, in
the sense that Shannon provided us with a theory of se-
crecy systems [121] and Simmons of authentication sys-
tems [122]. Quite apart from intellectual curiosity, there is
a strong practical reason to seek constructions whose secu-
rity is mathematically provable. This is because copyright
protection mechanisms may be subjected to attack over an
extraordinarily long period of time. Copyright subsists for
typically 50–70 years after the death of the artist, depend-
ing on the country and the medium; this means that mech-
anisms fielded today might be attacked using the resources
available in a hundred years’ time. Where cryptographic
systems need to provide such guarantees, as in espionage,
it is common to use a one-time pad because we can prove
that the secrecy of this system is independent of the com-
putational power available to the attacker. Is it possible to
get such a guarantee for an information hiding system?
A. Early results
An important step in developing a theory of a subject
is to clarify the definitions. Intuitively, the purpose of ste-
ganography is to set up a secret communication path be-
tween two parties such that any person in the middle can-
not detect its existence; the attacker should not gain any
information about the embedded data by simply looking at
cover-text or stego-text. This was first formalised by Sim-
mons in 1983 as the ‘prisoners’ problem’ [123]. Alice and
Bob are in jail and wish to prepare an escape plan. The
problem is that all their communications are arbitrated by
the warden Willie. If Willie sees any ciphertext in their
messages, he will frustrate them by putting them into soli-
tary confinement. So Alice and Bob must find a way to
exchange hidden messages.
Simmons showed that such a channel exists in certain
digital signature schemes: the random message key used in
these schemes can be manipulated to contain short mes-
sages. This exploitation of existing randomness means
that the message cannot even in principle be detected and
so Simmons called the technique the ‘subliminal channel’.
The history of the subliminal channel is described in [124],
while further results may be found in [122], [125], [126],
[127].
In the general case of steganography, where Willie is al-
lowed to modify the information flow between Alice and
Bob, he is called an active warden; but if he can only
observe it he is called a passive warden. Further studies
showed that public key steganography is possible (in this
model, Alice and Bob did not exchange secrets before go-
ing to jail, but have public keys known to each other) –
although the presence of an active warden makes public
key steganography more difficult [128].
This difficulty led to the introduction, in [129], of the
supraliminal channel, which is a very low bandwidth chan-
nel that Willie cannot afford to modify as it uses the most
perceptually significant components of the cover object as a
means of transmission. For example, a prisoner might write
a short story in which the message is encoded in the succes-
sion of towns or other locations at which the action takes
place. Details of these locations can be very thoroughly
woven into the plot, so it becomes in practice impossible
for Willie to alter the message – he must either allow the
message through or censor it. The effect of this technique
is to turn an active warden into a passive one. The same
effect may be obtained if the communicating parties are
allowed to use a digital signature scheme.
B. The general role of randomness
Raw media data rates do not necessarily represent infor-
mation rates. Analog values are quantised to n bits giving,
for instance, a data rate of 16 bit/sample for audio or 8
bit/pixel for monochrome images. The average informa-
tion rate is given by their entropy; indeed, the entropy of
monochrome images is generally around 4–6 bits per pixel.
This immediately suggests the use of this difference to hide
information. So if C is the cover-text and E the embed-
ded text, transmitted on a perfect n bit channel, one would
1072
have: H(E) ≤ n−H(C) bit/pixel, so all the gain provided
by compression is used for hiding. One could also take into
account the the stego-text S and impose the constraint that
no information is given about E, even knowing S and Ck
(a part of C typically the natural noise of the cover-text):
the transinformation should be zero T (E; (Ck, S)) = 0. In
this case, it can be shown that H(E) ≤ H(Ck|S) [130].
So the rate at which one can embed ciphertext in a cover-
object is bounded by the opponent’s uncertainty about the
cover-text given knowledge of stego-text. But this gives an
upper bound on the stego-capacity of a channel when for
a provably secure system we need a lower bound. In fact
all the theoretical bounds known to us are of this kind. In
addition, the opponent’s uncertainty and thus the capacity
might asymptotically be zero, as was noted in the context
of covert channels [131].
This also highlights the fact that steganography is much
more dependent on our understanding of the information
sources involved than cryptography is, which helps explain
why we do not have any lower bounds on capacity for em-
bedding data in general sources. It is also worth noting
that if we had a source which we understood completely
and so could compress perfectly, then we could simply sub-
ject the embedded data to our decompression algorithm
and send it as the stego-text directly. Thus steganogra-
phy would either be trivial or impossible depending on the
system [118].
Another way of getting round this problem is to take
advantage of the natural noise of the cover-text. Where
this can be identified, it can be replaced by the embedded
data (which we can assume has been encrypted and is thus
indistinguishable from random noise). This is the philoso-
phy behind some steganographic systems [132], [133], [60]
and early image marking systems [23] (it may not work if
the image is computer generated and thus has very smooth
colour gradations). It can also be applied to audio [52],
[134]; here, randomising is very important because simple
replacement of the least significant bit causes an audible
modification of the signal [52]. So a subset of modifiable
bits is chosen and the embedding density depends on the
observed statistics of the cover-signal [134] or on its psy-
choacoustic properties [52].
It is also possible to exploit noise elsewhere in the sys-
tem. For example, one might add small errors by tweaking
some bits at the physical or data link layer and hope that
error correction mechanisms would prevent anyone reading
the message from noticing anything. This approach would
usually fall foul of Kerckhoffs’ principle that the mecha-
nism is known to the opponent, but in some applications
it can be effective [135].
A more interesting way of embedding information is to
change the parameters of the source encoding. An example
is given by a marking technique proposed for DVD. The
encoder of the MPEG stream has many choices of how
the image can be encoded, based on the trade-off between
good compression and good quality – each choice conveys
one or more bits. Such schemes trade expensive marking
techniques for inexpensive mark detection; they may be an
alternative to signature marks in digital TV where the cost
of the consumer equipment is all-important [136].
Finally, in case the reader should think that there is any-
thing new under the sun, consider two interpretations of a
Beethoven symphony, one by Karajan the other one by
Bernstein. These are very similar, but also dramatically
different. They might even be considered to be different
encodings, and musicologists hope to eventually dicrimi-
nate between them automatically.
C. Robust marking systems
In the absence of a useful theory of information hiding,
we can ask the practical question of what makes a marking
scheme robust. This is in some ways a simpler problem
(everyone might know that a video is watermarked, but so
long as the mark is unobtrusive this may not matter) and
in other ways a harder one (the warden is guaranteed to be
active, as the pirate will try to erase marks).
As a working definition, we mean by a robust marking
system one with the following properties:
• Marks should not degrade the perceived quality of the
work. This immediately implies the need for a good quality
metric. In the context of images, pixel based metrics are
not satisfactory, and better measures based on perceptual
models can be used [107], [137];
• Detecting the presence and/or value of a mark should
require knowledge of a secret;
• If multiple marks are inserted in a single object, then
they should not interfere with each other; moreover if dif-
ferent copies of an object are distributed with different
marks, then different users should not be able to process
their copies in order to generate a new copy that identifies
none of them;
• The mark should survive all attacks that do not de-
grade the work’s perceived quality, including resampling,
re-quantisation, dithering, compression and especially com-
binations of these.
Requirements similar to these are found, for example, in
a recent call for proposals from the music industry [138].
However, as we have shown with our attacks, there are
at present few marking schemes, whether in the research
literature or on commercial sale, that are robust against at-
tacks involving carefully chosen distortions. Vendors when
pressed claim that their systems will withstand most at-
tacks but cannot reasonably be engineered to survive so-
phisticated ones. However, in the experience of a num-
ber of industries, it is ‘a wrong idea that high technology
serves as a barrier to piracy or copyright theft; one should
never underestimate the technical capability of copyright
thieves’ [139].
Our current opinion is that most applications have a
fairly sharp trade-off between robustness and data rate
which may prevent any single marking scheme meeting the
needs of all applications. However we do not see this as a
counsel of despair. The marking problem has so far been
over-abstracted; there is not one ‘marking problem’ but a
whole constellation of them. Most real applications do not
require all of the properties in the above list. For exam-
1073
ple, when monitoring radio transmissions to ensure that
adverts have been played as contracted, we only require
enough resistance to distortion to deal with naturally oc-
curring effects and prevent transfer of marks from one ad-
vert to another [140]; and where our concern is to make
proprietary images available to scholars, as in the ‘Vati-
can Library Accessible Worldwide’ project, IBM came up
with a simple solution using visible watermarks – which
leave the the documents still perfectly suitable for research
purposes but discourage illegal publication for profit [12].
VI. Conclusion
In this paper we gave an overview of information hid-
ing in general and steganography in particular. We looked
at a range of applications and tried to place the various
techniques in historical context in order to elucidate the
relationships between them, as many recently proposed sys-
tems have failed to learn from historical experience.
We then described a number of attacks on information
hiding systems, which between them demolish most of the
current contenders in the copyright marking business. We
have described a tool, StirMark, which breaks many of
them by adding sub-perceptual distortion; and we have
described a custom attack on echo hiding.
This led us to a discussion of marking in general. We de-
scribed some of the problems in constructing a general the-
ory and the practical requirements that marking schemes
and steganographic systems may have to meet. We ad-
vanced the suggestion that it is impractical to demand
that any one marking scheme satisfy all of these require-
ments simultaneously; that is, that ‘the marking problem,’
as sometimes described in the literature, is over-specified.
That does not of course mean that particular marking
problems are insoluble. Both historical precedent and re-
cent innovation provide us with a wide range of tools, which
if applied intelligently should be sufficient to solve most of
the problems that we meet in practice.
