“A teletype was a motorized typewriter that could transmit your keystrokes to the mainframe and then 
print the computer's response on its roll of paper. You typed a single line of text, hit the carriage return 
button, and waited for the teletype to begin noisily printing the computer's response (at a whopping 10 
characters per second). On the left-hand side of the teletype in the prior picture you can observe a paper 
tape reader and writer (i.e., puncher).”

6Terminal-Oriented Computer Networks
Terminal-Oriented 
Computer Networks
of 1960s and 1970s
• early computers were extremely expensive, so
time-sharing techniques were developed to allow
them to be shared by many users
• through use of video terminals multiple users were
able to simultaneously input instructions and obtain
results from the host computer
• modem devices* further enabled that terminals
reach the host computer via telephone network,
over a grater distance

8Terminal-Oriented Computer Networks   (cont.)
Line Sharing Challenges: • in a mainframe system, a large number of
terminals had to be connected to a central
computer
• cost of providing individual lines to each
terminal was prohibitive
• line sharing was more practical, but - how to 
chare a commonmedium in manner that is:
▪ fair – each machine gets a chance to send,
long waits prevented
▪ orderly – packets from each machine can be
properly assembled and reassembled
▪ error-free – recognize erroneous packets/data

Line Sharing Challenges:
Medium Access Control,
Frame-ing, 
Addressing
• medium access control methods allowed a
number of terminals to communicate with
central computer using a shared comm. line
• example:   polling protocol
• line sharing required that messages be 
partitioned into frames (header + data)
• frames / headers had to carry ‘address’
to identify receiving terminal

• communication lines and analog switching equipment
introduced errors in transmission
• error-control techniques were developed to ensure
error-free communication
• example:   Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) algorithm
– an error-detection scheme
(1) CRC is calculated based on frame header and payload
(2) CRC is appended to frame
(3) if receiver detects error, retransmission is requested
• some error-control techniques attempt to send enough
redundant info to enable both error-detection and error-
correction

12Computer-to-Computer Networks
Computer-to-Computer 
Networks
• as cost of computers dropped and new 
applications emerged, it became necessary
to enable mainframe computers (not terminals!)
to interconnect and communicate over long
geographic distances
• application examples:
file transfer between computers
multiprocess operation over multiple computers
• ARPANET (1960s) - 1st major effort at developing
a network to interconnect computers over a
wide geographic area  – first major WAN
• Internet (1970s) - emerged from ARPANET –
network of interconnected networks

Example [ ARPANET in 1977 ]
14Computer-to-Computer Networks   (cont.)
ARPANET:
Architecture
• network core consists of packet switches (dedicated 
minicomputers) to avoid costly full mesh topology
each packet switch connects to at least two other
switches to provide alternative paths in case of failure
• network transfer messages by breaking them into
packets of fixed size
long messages ⇒ long delays & higher prob. of error
each packet has a header with destination address –
packets are transmitted independently !!!
• network transfers packets using “store and forward”
principle

ARPANET:
Routing
Computer-to-Computer Networks   (cont.)
• each packet switch contains routing / forwarding tables
(‘next hop per destination’ tables)
each packet contains destination address  ⇒ packet switch
looks at routing table and forwards packet in right direction
• connectionless service
no connection setup is required prior to packet transmission
packets are buffered at packet switches to await transmission
on appropriate link
packets from different users are multiplexed on links between
packet switches

ARPANET:
Other Challenges!
• error control between adjacent packet switches
enables faster error recovery 
partial responsibility of IP protocol
• congestion control inside the network prevents
buffer overflow at core packet switches
• end-to-end flow control prevents buffer overflow
at receiver / sender
responsibility of TCP protocol

ARPANET:
Applications
• “dumb core, intelligent edges” enabled development 
of many interesting and useful applications:  e-mail,
file transfer (FTP),  remote login (Telnet)
dumb core – packet switches are only required / capable
of packet forwarding
intelligent edges – end-devices have considerable CPU
and memory capabilities

19Local Area Networks
LAN History
Transceivers
• in 1980s affordable computers become available 
• subsequently, need for low-cost, high-speed, and low
error-rate networks arose
to interconnect local workstations over small radius < 1km
to enable sharing of local resources (printers, servers, etc.)
• complex packet switching, congestion and flow control
were unnecessary
• variety of LAN topologies emerged, including: bus, ring
20
– one long cable, so-called backbone, links all devices in
the network – similar to single-line mainframe architecture
• each workstation connects to backbone through Network 
Interface Card (NIC); each NIC has globally unique address
• data frames are broadcast into coaxial cable
• receive:   NIC listens to medium for frames with its address
• send:   NIC listens to medium for presence of ongoing 
transmission – if no transmission is found, send frame
• collision:   if frame collides with somebody else’s frame,
abort transmission and retry later
Local Area Networks   (cont.)
Bus Topology
(Ethernet)
21Local Area Networks   (cont.)
• advantages:   simple & inexpensive installation
• disadvantages:   1)  backbone  =  single point of failure
2)  collisions  ⇒ diminishing capacity
if two or more devices transmit
simultaneously their signals will 
interfere
Bus Topology
(Ethernet)
22
23Local Area Networks   (cont.)
Ring Topology  – each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection
only with the two devices on either side of it
• a small frame – token – circulates around the ring; only
the station that possesses the token is allowed to transmit
at any given time
• signal is passed along the ring in one direction, from device
to device, until it reaches its destination
• advantages:   fairness in access / effective use of bandwidth
– token-passing provides each station with a
turn to transmit
• disadvantages:   entire network will fail if there is a failure in
any transmission link or in the mechanism
that relays the token

25The Internet
Internet = Internetwork – two or more interconnected networks – network
of networks
The Internet:
Past
The Internet:
Present
• LANs that emerged in 1970s were different in terms of
their underlying technology and operation
• a protocol that would enable communication across
multiple dissimilar networks was needed
“higher level of abstraction” protocol
• Internet Protocol / Addressing were soon developed and
enabled creation of a single global internetwork
• spread over 200 countries
• made up of 100,000s of interconnected networks, 
10,000,000s of interconnected hosts, and 
100,000,000s of users
• still grows exponentially …

IP Network =
the Internet
• each component network must contain special packet
switch, gateway / router, through which it interconnects
with rest of the Internet
• host computers place data in IP packets (data + IP header)
and deliver them to nearest router
• router, with help of other routers, attempts to forward
packet across the Internet
• “best effort service” – IP provides no mechanism to deal
with packet loss, corruption, reordering
27The Internet   (cont.)
IP Addressing • addressing scheme that fits (inter)network structure:
IP address = Net ID + Host ID
• IP packets are routed only based on Net ID in destination
IP address
routers have to know only major networks, not every single
host ⇒ less memory / network update requirements
smaller routing tables  ⇒ faster routing

29Circuit vs. Packet Switching
Circuit-Switched Networks
(telephone networks)
Advantages
• circuit establishment delay – circuit establishment
introduces ‘initial delay’
• inefficient use of capacity – channel capacity is
dedicated for the duration of a connection, even if no
data is being transferred (e.g. silent periods in speech)
• network complexity – end-to-end circuit establishment
and bandwidth allocation requires complex signaling
software to coordinate operation of switches
Disadvantages
• guaranteed Quality of Service  – data is transmitted
at fixed (guaranteed) rate;  delay at nodes is negligible
30Circuit vs. Packet Switching   (cont.)
Advantages • greater line efficiency  – network links are dynamically shared
by many packets / connections
• no blocked traffic  – packets are accepted even under heavy
traffic, but delivery delay may increase
• variable delay – each node introduces additional variable
delay due to processing and queueing
• overhead  – to route packets through a packet-switching
network, overhead information including the address of
destination and/or sequence information must be added to
each packet
