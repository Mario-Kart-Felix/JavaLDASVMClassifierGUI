Term Bioinformatics
Term Bioinformatics   was invented by Paulien 
Hogeweg  (Полина Хогевег) and Ben Hesper 
in 1970 as "the study of informatic processes 
in biotic systems".
Paulien Hogeweg is a Dutch theoretical biologist 
and complex systems researcher studying 
biological systems as dynamic information 
processing systems at many interconnected 
levels.
Definitions of what is Bioinformatics:
       Bioinformatics is the use of IT in biotechnology for the data storage, data 
warehousing and analyzing the DNA sequences. In Bioinfomatics knowledge of 
many branches are required like biology, mathematics, computer science, laws of 
physics & chemistry, and of course sound  knowledge of  IT to analyze biotech 
data. Bioinformatics is not limited to the computing data, but in reality it can be 
used to solve many biological problems and find out how living things works.
Bioinformatics s an interdisciplinary field that develops and improves upon 
methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data. A 
major activity in bioinformatics is to develop software tools to generate useful 
biological knowledge.
The mathematical, statistical and computing methods that 
aim to solve biological problems using DNA and amino acid 
sequences and related information.
My additions:
1. Bioinformatics is a SCIENCE 
2. Not only to develop algorithms, store, retrieve, organize and 
analyze biological data but to CURATE data 3
Bioinformatics develops algorithms and biological software 
of computer to analyze and record the data related to 
biology for example the data of genes, proteins, drug 
ingredients and metabolic pathways.
Bioinformatics is being used in 
following fields:
Microbial genome

Genome Assembly
• Genome assembly is a very complex computational problem 
due to enormous amount of data to put together and some 
other reasons reasons.
• Ideally an assembly program should produce one contig for 
every chromosome of the genome being sequenced.  But 
because of the complex nature of the genomes, the ideal 
conditions just never possible, thus leading to gaps in the 
genome.

De Novo assembly - puzzle without the 
picture
Assembly Challenges 
• Presence of repeats. Repeats are identical sequences that occur in 
the genome in different locations and are often seen in varying 
lengths and in the multiple copies.  There are several types of 
repeats: tandem repeats or interspersed repeats. The read's 
originating from different copies of the repeat appear identical to the 
assembler, causing errors in the assembly.
• Contaminants in samples (eg. from Bacteria or Human).
• PCR artefacts (eg. Chimeras and Mutations)
• Sequencing errors, such as “Homopolymer” errors – when eg. 2+ run 
of same base. 
• MID’s (multiplex indexes), primers/adapters still in the raw reads.
• polyploid genomes

Problems caused by new sequencing technologies:
 Hard to find overlaps between short reads
 Impossible to scale up

Gene Prediction and Genome 
Annotation
Based on similarity to 
known genes – blastX 
(NCBI) 
  Gene finding programs
• Glimmer – for most 
procaryotic genomes
• GenMark – for both 
procaryotic genomes 
and eucaryotic genomes

Re-sequencing
Projects aimed at characterizing the genetic 
variations of species or populations 
Resequencing of bacterial and archaeal isolates 
etc is possible if reference genomes are 
available
This approach can help to better understand 
bacterial community structure, gene function in 
bacteria under selective pressure or in 
mutagenized strains. 
Climate change Studies
Increasing levels of carbon dioxide emission are 
thought to contribute to global climate 
change.
One way to decrease atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is to study the genomes of microbes 
that use carbone dioxidet as their sole carbon 
source 
The human microbiome includes viruses, fungi and bacteria, their genes and 
their environmental interactions, and is known to influence human 
physiology.
There’s very broad variation in these bacteria in different people and that 
severely limits our ability to create a “normal” microflora profile for 
comparison among healthy people and those with any kind of health issues.

Children with autism harbor significantly 
fewer types of gut bacteria than those 
who are not affected by the disorder, 
researchers have found. 
Prevotella species were most dramatically 
reduced among samples from autistic 
children—especially P. copri. (helps the 
breakdown of protein and carbohydrate 
foods)
Bioinformatics combining biology 
with computer science
- it can explore the causes of diseases at the molecular 
level 
- explain the phenomena of the diseases on the 
gene/pathway level 
- make use of computer techniques (data mining, 
machine learning etc), to analyze and interpret  data 
faster 
- to enhance the accuracy of the results 
Reduce the cost and time of drug discovery
To improve drug discovery we need to discover
(read "develop") efficient bioinformatics
algorithms and approaches for
target identification
target validation
lead identification 
lead optimization
Advantages of detecting mutations with 
next-generation sequencing
High throughput
 Test many genes at once
Systematic, unbiased mutation detection
 All mutation types
▪ Single nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number variation 
(CNV)-insertions, deletions and translocations
Digital readout of mutation frequency
 Easier to detect and quantify mutations in a 
heterogeneous sample
Cost effective precision medicine
 “Right drug at right dose to the right patient at the 
right time”

Bioinformatics and Health Informatics
If bioinformatics is the study of the flow of 
information in biological sciences, Health 
Informatics is the study of the information in 
patient care
