At Crows Nest State School all students are given the opportunity to develop skills in 
Information and Communication Technology. We have the staff expertise and infrastructure to 
enable students to improve learning outcomes via the use of networked computers with 
various software applications, the Internet and Electronic Mail. 
 
However, the privilege of using this technology brings with it a number of student 
responsibilities. A signed parental approval for Network and Internet Access must be received 
before students access this technology. Students must also sign this undertaking to abide by 
the school’s Network and Internet Access Guidelines.  
 
What Students are expected to do: 
 
• Do not disclose your password to others 
• Use the Network and the Internet resources ONLY for educational purposes 
• Use school email account for school work only 
• Responsibly manage your H drive allocation. 
• Immediately report faults or damage of computers or furniture to the class teacher 
• Treat ALL EQUIPMENT WITH RESPECT 
• Inform teachers of ANY illegal, dangerous or offensive material they may come across 
• Comply with copyright laws. 
 
What Students are NOT to do: 
 
• Upload, download or print any illegal, dangerous or offensive material 
• Reveal any personal details over the internet or email systems 
• Access any web based email accounts (HOTMAIL, YAHOO etc) 
• Use the internet to offend anyone else 
• Copy any software or data from the school’s network 
• Install any programs or software onto any computer 
• Download any applications for entertainment ie games, screensavers music, videos 
etc. 
• Adjust or rearrange any hardware on the tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse etc. 
 
Students need to be aware it is an Education Queensland requirement that the Network 
Administrator reserves the right to access student files without notice. In addition, all 
Internet activity and access is logged. Random\m checks will be made to ensure the 
safety and integrity of the network.  
 
Students who fail to follow the procedures and policy relating to Network and Internet access 
will face appropriate sanctions. These could include measures such as loss of network an 
Internet access, further disciplinary action and even withdrawal from a computer subject in 
some cases. HOWEVER, we are pleased to report the large majority of students make 
effective use of these very valuable information and communication technologies.  
 
Printing and Internet Download Limits 
 
All students will be given access to printing and Internet usage to complete their studies. 
Printing and internet usage will be monitored and excessive or inappropriate use will be 
investigated. See Mrs Schick or Mr Edmunds if you have any issues with these limits.
