ABSTRACT
We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel
routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the po-
sitions of routers and a packet’s destination to make packet for-
warding decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions us-
ing only information about a router’s immediate neighbors in the
network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy
forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around
the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local
topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path
and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations
increases. Under mobility’s frequent topology changes, GPSR can
use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly.
We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of
mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of
Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR’s
scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.
1. INTRODUCTION
In networks comprised entirely of wireless stations, communica-
tion between source and destination nodes may require traversal
of multiple hops, as radio ranges are finite. A community of ad-
hoc network researchers has proposed, implemented, and measured
a variety of routing algorithms for such networks. The observa-
tion that topology changes more rapidly on a mobile, wireless net-
work than on wired networks, where the use of Distance Vector
(DV), Link State (LS), and Path Vector routing algorithms is well-
established, motivates this body of work.
DV and LS algorithms require continual distribution of a current
map of the entire network’s topology to all routers. DV’s Bellman-
Ford approach constructs this global picture transitively; each router
includes its distance from all network destinations in each of its pe-
riodic beacons. LS’s Dijkstra approach directly floods announce-
ments of the change in any link’s status to every router in the net-

work. Small inaccuracies in the state at a router under both DV
and LS can cause routing loops or disconnection [29]. When the
topology is in constant flux, as under mobility, LS generates tor-
rents of link status change messages, and DV either suffers from
out-of-date state [4], or generates torrents of triggered updates.
The two dominant factors in the scaling of a routing algorithm are:
 The rate of change of the topology.
 The number of routers in the routing domain.
Both factors affect the message complexity of DV and LS routing
algorithms: intuitively, pushing current state globally costs packets
proportional to the product of the rate of state change and number
of destinations for the updated state.
Hierarchy is the most widely deployed approach to scale routing as
the number of network destinations increases. Without hierarchy,
Internet routing could not scale to support today’s number of Inter-
net leaf networks. An Autonomous System runs an intra-domain
routing protocol inside its borders, and appears as a single entity
in the backbone inter-domain routing protocol, BGP. This hierar-
chy is based on well-defined and rarely changing administrative
and topological boundaries. It is therefore not easily applicable to
freely moving ad-hoc wireless networks, where topology has no
well-defined AS boundaries, and routers may have no common ad-
ministrative authority.
Caching has come to prominence as a strategy for scaling ad-hoc
routing protocols. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [12], Ad-Hoc
On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) [21], and the Zone
Routing Protocol (ZRP) [10] all eschew constantly pushing current
topology information network-wide. Instead, routers running these
protocols request topological information in an on-demand fashion
as required by their packet forwarding load, and cache it aggres-
sively. When their cached topological information becomes out-of-
date, these routers must obtain more current topological informa-
tion to continue routing successfully. Caching reduces the routing
protocols’ message load in two ways: it avoids pushing topological
information where the forwarding load does not require it (e.g., at
idle routers), and it often reduces the number of hops between the
router that has the needed topological information and the router
that requires it (i.e., a node closer than a changed link may already
have cached the new status of that link).
We propose the aggressive use of geography to achieve scalability
in our wireless routing protocol, Greedy Perimeter Stateless Rout-
ing (GPSR). We aim for scalability under increasing numbers of
nodes in the network, and increasing mobility rate. As these fac-
tors increase, our measures of scalability are:
 Routing protocol message cost: How many routing protocol
packets does a routing algorithm send?
 Application packet delivery success rate: What fraction of
applications’ packets are delivered successfully by a routing
algorithm?
 Per-node state: How much storage does a routing algorithm
require at each node?
Networks that push on mobility, number of nodes, or both include:
 Ad-hoc networks: Perhaps the most investigated category,
these mobile networks have no fixed infrastructure, and sup-
port applications for military users, post-disaster rescuers,
and temporary collaborations among temporary associates,
as at a business conference or lecture [10], [12], [20], [21],
[22].
 Sensor networks: Comprised of small sensors, these mobile
networks can be deployed with very large numbers of nodes,
and have very impoverished per-node resources [6], [13].
Minimization of state per node in a network of tens of thou-
sands of memory-poor sensors is crucial.
 “Rooftop” networks: Proposed by Shepard [24], these wire-
less networks are not mobile, but are deployed very densely
in metropolitan areas (the name refers to an antenna on each
building’s roof, for line-of-sight with neighbors) as an alter-
native to wired networking offered by traditional telecommu-
nications providers. Such a network also provides an alter-
nate infrastructure in the event of failure of the conventional
one, as after a disaster. A routing system that self-configures
(without a trusted authority to configure a routing hierarchy)
for hundreds of thousands of such nodes in a metropolitan
area represents a significant scaling challenge.
Traditional shortest-path (DV and LS) algorithms require state pro-
portional to the number of reachable destinations at each router.
On-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms require state at least pro-
portional to the number of destinations a node forwards packets
toward, and often more, as in the case in DSR, in which a node ag-
gressively caches all source routes it overhears to reduce the prop-
agation scope of other nodes’ flooded route requests.
We will show that geographic routing allows routers to be nearly
stateless, and requires propagation of topology information for only
a single hop: each node need only know its neighbors’ positions.
The self-describing nature of position is the key to geography’s
usefulness in routing. The position of a packet’s destination and
positions of the candidate next hops are sufficient to make correct
forwarding decisions, without any other topological information.
We assume in this work that all wireless routers know their own
positions, either from a GPS device, if outdoors, or through other
means. Practical solutions include surveying, for stationary wire-
less routers; inertial sensors, on vehicles; and acoustic range-finding

using ultrasonic “chirps” indoors [28]. We further assume bidirec-
tional radio reachability. The widely used IEEE 802.11 wireless
network MAC [11] sends link-level acknowledgements for all uni-
cast packets, so that all links in an 802.11 network must be bidi-
rectional. We simulate a network that uses 802.11 radios to evalu-
ate our routing protocol. We consider topologies where the wire-
less nodes are roughly in a plane. Finally, we assume that packet
sources can determine the locations of packet destinations, to mark
packets they originate with their destination’s location. Thus, we
assume a location registration and lookup service that maps node
addresses to locations [18]. Queries to this system use the same
geographic routing system as data packets; the querier geographi-
cally addresses his request to a location server. The scope of this
paper is limited to geographic routing. We argue for the eminent
practicality of the location service briefly in Section 3.7. We adopt
IP terminology throughout this paper, though GPSR can be applied
to any datagram network.
In the following sections, we describe the algorithms that comprise
GPSR, measure and analyze GPSR’s performance and behavior
in simulated mobile networks, cite and differentiate related work,
identify future research opportunities suggested by GPSR, and con-
clude by summarizing our findings.
2. ALGORITHMS AND EXAMPLES
We now describe the Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing algo-
rithm. The algorithm consists of two methods for forwarding pack-
ets: greedy forwarding, which is used wherever possible, and perime-
ter forwarding, which is used in the regions greedy forwarding can-
not be.
2.1 Greedy Forwarding
As alluded to in the introduction, under GPSR, packets are marked
by their originator with their destinations’ locations. As a result,
a forwarding node can make a locally optimal, greedy choice in
choosing a packet’s next hop. Specifically, if a node knows its ra-
dio neighbors’ positions, the locally optimal choice of next hop
is the neighbor geographically closest to the packet’s destination.
Forwarding in this regime follows successively closer geographic
hops, until the destination is reached. An example of greedy next-
hop choice appears in Figure 1. Here, x receives a packet destined
for D. x’s radio range is denoted by the dotted circle about x, and
the arc with radius equal to the distance between y and D is shown
as the dashed arc about D. x forwards the packet to y, as the dis-
tance between y and D is less than that between D and any of x’s
other neighbors. This greedy forwarding process repeats, until the
packet reaches D.
A simple beaconing algorithm provides all nodes with their neigh-
bors’ positions: periodically, each node transmits a beacon to the
broadcast MAC address, containing only its own identifier (e.g., IP
address) and position. We encode position as two four-byte floating-
point quantities, for x and y coordinate values. To avoid synchro-
nization of neighbors’ beacons, as observed by Floyd and Jacob-
son [8], we jitter each beacon’s transmission by 50% of the interval
B between beacons, such that the mean inter-beacon transmission
interval is B, uniformly distributed in [0:5B;1:5B].
Upon not receiving a beacon from a neighbor for longer than time-
out interval T , a GPSR router assumes that the neighbor has failed
or gone out-of-range, and deletes the neighbor from its table. The
802.11 MAC layer also gives direct indications of link-level re-
transmission failures to neighbors; we interpret these indications
identically. We have used T = 4:5B, three times the maximum jit-
tered beacon interval, in this work.
Greedy forwarding’s great advantage is its reliance only on knowl-
edge of the forwarding node’s immediate neighbors. The state re-
quired is negligible, and dependent on the density of nodes in the
wireless network, not the total number of destinations in the net-
work.1 On networks where multi-hop routing is useful, the number
of neighbors within a node’s radio range must be substantially less
than the total number of nodes in the network.
The position a node associates with a neighbor becomes less cur-
rent between beacons as that neighbor moves. The accuracy of the
set of neighbors also decreases; old neighbors may leave and new
neighbors may enter radio range. For these reasons, the correct
choice of beaconing interval to keep nodes’ neighbor tables current
depends on the rate of mobility in the network and range of nodes’
radios. We show the effect of this interval on GPSR’s performance
in our simulation results. We note that keeping current topological
state for a one-hop radius about a router is the minimum required to
do any routing; no useful forwarding decision can be made without
knowledge of the topology one or more hops away.
This beaconing mechanism does represent pro-active routing pro-
tocol traffic, avoided by DSR and AODV. To minimize the cost of
beaconing, GPSR piggybacks the local sending node’s position on
all data packets it forwards, and runs all nodes’ network interfaces
in promiscuous mode, so that each station receives a copy of all
packets for all stations within radio range. At a small cost in bytes
(twelve bytes per packet), this scheme allows all packets to serve
as beacons. When any node sends a data packet, it can then reset
its inter-beacon timer. This optimization reduces beacon traffic in
regions of the network actively forwarding data packets.
In fact, we could make GPSR’s beacon mechanism fully reactive by
having nodes solicit beacons with a broadcast “neighbor request”
only when they have data traffic to forward. We have not felt it nec-
essary to take this step, however, as the one-hop beacon overhead
does not congest our simulated networks.
The power of greedy forwarding to route using only neighbor nodes’
positions comes with one attendant drawback: there are topologies
in which the only route to a destination requires a packet move tem-
porarily farther in geometric distance from the destination [7], [16].
A simple example of such a topology is shown in Figure 2. Here,
x is closer to D than its neighbors w and y. Again, the dashed arc

refers to this small, purely local state.

about D has a radius equal to the distance between x and D. Al-
though two paths, (x! y! z!D) and (x! w! v!D), exist to
D, x will not choose to forward to w or y using greedy forwarding.
x is a local maximum in its proximity to D. Some other mechanism
must be used to forward packets in these situations.
2.2 The Right-Hand Rule: Perimeters
Motivated by Figure 2, we note that the intersection of x’s circular
radio range and the circle about D of radius jxDj (that is, of the
length of line segment xD) is empty of neighbors. We show this
region clearly in Figure 3. From node x’s perspective, we term the
shaded region without nodes a void. x seeks to forward a packet to
destination D beyond the edge of this void. Intuitively, x seeks to
route around the void; if a path to D exists from x, it doesn’t include
nodes located within the void (or x would have forwarded to them
greedily).
The long-known right-hand rule for traversing a graph is depicted
in Figure 4. This rule states that when arriving at node x from node
y, the next edge traversed is the next one sequentially counterclock-
wise about x from edge (x;y). It is known that the right-hand rule
traverses the interior of a closed polygonal region (a face) in clock-
wise edge order—in this case, the triangle bounded by the edges
between nodes x, y, and z, in the order (y ! x ! z ! y). The rule
traverses an exterior region, in this case, the region outside the same
triangle, in counterclockwise edge order.
We seek to exploit these cycle-traversing properties to route around
voids. In Figure 3, traversing the cycle (x!w! v!D! z! y!
x) by the right-hand rule amounts to navigating around the pictured
void, specifically, to nodes closer to the destination than x (in this
case, including the destination itself, D). We call the sequence of
y

edges traversed by the right-hand rule a perimeter.
In earlier work [15], [16], we propose mapping perimeters by send-
ing packets on tours of them, using the right-hand rule. The state
accumulated in these packets is cached by nodes, which recover
from local maxima in greedy forwarding by routing to a node on a
cached perimeter closer to the destination. This approach requires
a heuristic, the no-crossing heuristic, to force the right-hand rule
to find perimeters that enclose voids in regions where edges of the
graph cross. This heuristic improves reachability results overall,
but still leaves a serious liability: the algorithm does not always
find routes when they exist. The no-crossing heuristic blindly re-
moves whichever edge it encounters second in a pair of crossing
edges. The edge it removes, however, may partition the network. If
it does, the algorithm will not find routes that cross this partition.
2.3 Planarized Graphs
While the no-crossing heuristic empirically finds the vast majority
of routes (over 99.5% of the n(n  1) routes among n nodes [16])
in randomly generated networks, it is unacceptable for a routing
algorithm persistently to fail to find a route to a reachable node in
a static, unchanging network topology. Motivated by the insuffi-
ciency of the no-crossing heuristic, we present alternative methods
for eliminating crossing links from the network.
A graph in which no two edges cross is known as planar. A set
of nodes with radios, where all radios have identical, circular radio
range r, can be seen as a graph: each node is a vertex, and edge
(n;m) exists between nodes n and m if the distance between n and
m, d(n;m)  r. Graphs whose edges are dictated by a threshold
distance between vertices are termed unit graphs. In the sense that
network radio hardware is traditionally viewed as having a nominal
open-space range (e.g., 250 meters for 900 MHz DSSS WaveLAN),
this model is reasonable. We additionally assume that the nodes in
the network have negligible difference in altitude, so that they can
be considered roughly in a plane. We discuss these assumptions
further in Section 5.
The Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG) and Gabriel Graph (GG)
are two planar graphs long-known in varied disciplines [9], [27].
An algorithm for removing edges from the graph that are not part of
the RNG or GG would yield a network with no crossing links. For
our application, the algorithm should be run in a distributed fashion
by each node in the network, where a node needs information only
about the local topology as the algorithm’s input. However, for this
strategy to be successful, one important property must be shown:
u v
w
Figure 5: The RNG graph. For edge (u;v) to be included, the
shaded lune must contain no witness w.
Removing edges from the graph to reduce it to the
RNG or GG must not disconnect the graph; this would
amount to partitioning the network.
Given a collection of vertices with known positions, the RNG is
defined as follows:
An edge (u;v) exists between vertices u and v if the
distance between them, d(u;v), is less than or equal to
the distance between every other vertex w, and whichever
of u and v is farther from w. In equational form:
8w 6= u;v : d(u;v) max[d(u;w);d(v;w)]
Figure 5 depicts the rule for constructing the RNG. The shaded
region, the lune between u and v, must be empty of any witness
node w for (u;v) to be included in the RNG. The boundary of the
lune is the intersection of the circles about u and v of radius d(u;v).
When we begin with a connected unit graph and remove edges not
part of the RNG, note that we cannot disconnect the graph. (u;v) is
only eliminated from the graph when there exists a w within range
of both u and v. Thus, eliminating an edge requires an alternate path
through a witness exist. Each connected component in an unob-
structed radio network will not be disconnected by removing edges
not in the RNG.
Under the previously described beaconing mechanism, through which
all nodes know their immediate neighbors, if u and v can reach one
another, they must both know all nodes with the lune. Starting from
a full list of its neighbors, N, each node u can remove non-RNG
links as follows:
for all v 2 N do
for all w 2 N do
if w == v then
continue
else if d(u;v) > max[d(u;w);d(v;w)] then
eliminate edge (u;v)
break
end if
end for
end for
The GG is defined as follows:
An edge (u;v) exists between vertices u and v if no
u v
w
Figure 6: The GG graph. For edge (u;v) to be included, the
shaded circle must contain no witness w.
other vertex w is present within the circle whose diam-
eter is uv. In equational form:
8w 6= u;v : d2(u;v)< [d2(u;w)+d2(v;w)]
Figure 6 depicts the GG graph membership criterion.
As the midpoint of uv is the center of the circle with diameter uv,
a node u can remove its non-GG links from a full neighbor list N
thus:
m = midpoint of uv
for all v 2 N do
for all w 2 N do
if w == v then
continue
else if d(m;w)< d(u;m) then
eliminate edge (u;v)
break
end if
end for
end for
Eliminating edges in the GG cannot disconnect a connected unit
graph, for the same reason as was the case for the RNG. Both these
algorithms for rendering the graph of the radio network planar take
time O(deg2) at each node, where deg is the node’s degree in the
full radio graph.
It has been shown in the literature [27] that the RNG is a sub-
set of the GG. This is consistent with the smaller shaded region
searched for a witness in the GG, as compared with in the RNG.
Figure 7 shows a full unit graph corresponding to 200 nodes ran-
domly placed on a 2000-by-2000-meter region, with radio ranges
of 250 meters; the GG subset of the full graph; and the RNG sub-
set of the full graph. Note that the RNG and GG offer differ-
ent densities of connectivity by eliminating different numbers of
links. Many MAC layers exhibit drastically reduced efficiency as
the number of mutually reachable sending stations increases [1],
[5]. Moreover, while any packet a node transmits monopolizes the
shared channel within its radio range, MAC protocols that address
the hidden terminal problem, including 802.11 [11], MACA [14],
and MACAW [2], deliberately spread contention to the full radio
ranges of both sender and receiver. Under such regimes, using
fewer links in routing can improve spatial diversity.
2.4 Combining Greedy and Planar Perimeters
We now present the full Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing algo-
rithm, which combines greedy forwarding (Section 2.1) on the full

network graph with perimeter forwarding on the planarized net-
work graph where greedy forwarding is not possible. Recall that
all nodes maintain a neighbor table, which stores the addresses and
locations of their single-hop radio neighbors. This table provides
all state required for GPSR’s forwarding decisions, beyond the state
in the packets themselves.
The packet header fields GPSR uses in perimeter-mode forwarding
are shown in Table 1. GPSR packet headers include a flag field in-
dicating whether the packet is in greedy mode or perimeter mode.
All data packets are marked initially at their originators as greedy-
mode. Packet sources also include the geographic location of the
destination in packets. Only a packet’s source sets the location des-
tination field; it is left unchanged as the packet is forwarded through
the network.
Upon receiving a greedy-mode packet for forwarding, a node searches
its neighbor table for the neighbor geographically closest to the
packet’s destination. If this neighbor is closer to the destination,
the node forwards the packet to that neighbor. When no neighbor
is closer, the node marks the packet into perimeter mode.
GPSR forwards perimeter-mode packets using a simple planar graph
traversal. In essence, when a packet enters perimeter mode at node
x bound for node D, GPSR forwards it on progressively closer faces
of the planar graph, each of which is crossed by the line xD. A
planar graph has two types of faces. Interior faces are the closed
polygonal regions bounded by the graph’s edges. The exterior face
is the one unbounded face outside the outer boundary of the graph.
On each face, the traversal uses the right-hand rule to reach an edge
that crosses line xD. At that edge, the traversal moves to the adja-
cent face crossed by xD. See Figure 8 for an example. Note that in
the figure, each face traversed is pierced by xD—the first two and
last faces are interior faces, while the third is the exterior face.2
When a packet enters perimeter mode, GPSR records in the packet
the location Lp, the site where greedy forwarding failed. This loca-
tion is used at subsequent hops to determine whether the packet can
be returned to greedy mode. Each time GPSR forwards a packet
onto a new face, it records in Lf the point on xD shared between
the previous and new faces. Note that Lf need not be located at a
node; xD usually intersects edges, as in Figure 8. Finally, GPSR
records e0, the first edge (sender and receiver addresses) a packet
crosses on a new face, in the packet.
Upon receiving a perimeter-mode packet for forwarding, GPSR
first compares the location Lp in a perimeter-mode packet with
the forwarding node’s location. GPSR returns a packet to greedy

sition; true GPSR forwards greedily when neighbors closer to the
destination are available.

mode if the distance from the forwarding node to D is less than that
from Lp to D.3 Perimeter forwarding is only intended to recover
from a local maximum; once the packet reaches a location closer
than where greedy forwarding previously failed for that packet, the
packet can continue greedy progress toward the destination without
danger of returning to the prior local maximum.
When a packet enters perimeter mode at x, GPSR forwards it along
the face intersected by the line xD. x forwards the packet to the
first edge counterclockwise about x from the line xD. This deter-
mines the first face over which to forward the packet. Thereafter,
GPSR forwards the packet around that face using the right-hand
rule. There are two cases to consider: either x and D are connected
by the graph, or they are not.
When x and D are connected by the graph, traversing the face bor-
dering x in either direction (we use the previously described right-
hand rule) must lead to a point y at which xD intersects the far side
of the face. This is the case whether the traversed face is interior or
exterior. At y, GPSR has clearly reduced the distance between the
packet and its destination, in comparison with the packet’s start in
perimeter mode at x.
While forwarding around a face, GPSR determines whether the

were closer to D than Lp. We have not implemented this variant.
edge to the chosen next hop n intersects xD. GPSR has the in-
formation required to make this determination, as Lp and D are
recorded in the packet, and a GPSR node stores its own position
and those of its neighbors. If a node borders the edge where this
intersection point y lies, GPSR sets the packet’s L f to y. At this
point, the packet is forwarded along the next face bordering point y
that is intersected by xD. The node forwards the packet along the
first edge of this next face—by the right-hand rule, the next edge
counterclockwise about itself from n. This first edge on the new
face is recorded in the packet’s e0 field.
This process repeats at successively closer faces to D. At each face,
the packet progresses by the right-hand rule until reaching the edge
that interesects with xD at a point y closer than the packet’s Lf field
to D. Finally, the face containing D is reached, and the right-hand-
rule leads to D along that face.
When D is not reachable (i.e., it is disconnected from the graph),
two cases exist: the disconnected node lies either inside an interior
face, or outside the exterior face. GPSR will forward a perimeter-
mode packet until the packet reaches the corresponding face. Upon
reaching this interior or exterior face, the packet will tour unsuc-
cessfully around the entirety of the face, without finding an edge
intersecting xD at a point closer to D than Lf . When the packet
traverses the first edge it took on this face for the second time,
GPSR notices the repetition of forwarding on the edge e0 stored
in the packet, and correctly drops the packet, as the destination
is unreachable; the perimeter-mode graph traversal to a reachable
destination never sends a packet across the same link in the same
direction twice.
Note that GPSR will greedily forward a packet for potentially many
hops, before the packet loops on an exterior or interior face and is
recognized as undeliverable. If the majority of unreachable des-
tinations lie beyond the boundary of a single face, undeliverable
packets may concentrate at that face of the network graph. This
behavior is a direct consequence of GPSR’s avoidance of transitive
routing protocol traffic across the many hops from a destination to
a forwarding router. Other techniques for scaling routing have sim-
ilar effects, however: the hierarchy used to scale routing on wired
networks obscures intra-domain link failures from the backbone in
the interest of scaling. Thus, the inter-domain routing system will
push a packet a great distance, with the potential result that the
packet will be dropped inside the destination AS.
By the end-to-end argument [23], the most logical place for routing
unreachability to be determined, and the load on the network from
undeliverable packets to be reduced, is at the sending end-system.
Mechanisms from inside the network, like ICMP Unreachable, are
hard to interpret at senders; it is hard to know on what timescale
they indicate unreachability, for example. Applications running
over a GPSR-routed network, or any other network, should offer
a conforming load; senders should cut their transmission rate ab-
sent feedback from receivers.
2.5 Protocol Implementation
To make GPSR robust on a mobile IEEE 802.11 network, we made
the following significant choices in our implementation:
 Support for MAC-layer failure feedback: As used in DSR
[4], we receive notification from the 802.11 MAC layer when
a packet exceeds its maximum number of retransmit retries.
Barring congestive collapse, a retransmit retry exceeded fail-
ure indicates that the intended recipient has left radio range.
Use of this feedback may inform GPSR earlier than other-
wise possible through expiration of the neighbor timeout in-
terval (4:5B).
 Interface queue traversal: Related to MAC-layer feedback,
this implementation detail had a profound effect on our re-
sults. While an IEEE 802.11 interface repeatedly retransmits
the packet at the head of its queue, it head-of-line blocks,
waiting for a link-level acknowledgement from the receiver.
This head-of-line blocking reduces the available transmit duty
cycle of the interface significantly. For this reason, upon
notification of a MAC retransmit retry failure, we traverse
the queue of packets for the interface, and remove all pack-
ets addressed to the failed transmission’s recipient. We pass
these packets back to the routing protocol for re-forwarding
to a different next hop. This change virtually eliminated
what we’d previously thought to be MAC contention in high-
mobility simulations where neighbors were lost frequently;
the timeouts and head-of-line blocking were what really had
been causing the drops at the interface queue. The imple-
mentation of DSR for ns-2 [25] implements this useful opti-
mization, though we don’t see it mentioned in the published
work on DSR.
 Promiscuous use of the network interface: Also as used
in DSR [4], GPSR disables MAC address filtering to receive
copies of all packets for all stations within its radio range. As
described in Section 2.1, all packets carry their local sender’s
position, to reduce the rate at which beacon packets must
be sent, and to keep positions in neighbor lists maximally
current in regions under traffic load.
 Planarization of the graph: Both the RNG and GG pla-
narizations depend on having current position information
for a node’s current set of neighbors. We have implemented
both planarizations, though the results we present in this pa-
per use only the RNG. As nodes move, a planarization be-
comes stale, and less useful for accurate perimeter-mode packet
forwarding. In our current implementation, we re-planarize
the graph upon every acquisition of a new neighbor, and ev-
ery loss of a former neighbor, as distinguishable by receipt of
a beacon or data packet (promiscuously) from a previously
unknown neighbor, and by a beacon timeout for a neighbor,
or MAC transmit failure indication. However, this choice
will not keep the planarization current if nodes only move
within a node’s radio range, but no nodes move into or out of
it. In future, we will incrementally update the planarization
upon receipt of every beacon (or promiscuous data packet)
from a neighbor, to keep the planarized graph maximally up-
to-date.
3. SIMULATION RESULTS AND
EVALUATION
To measure our success in meeting the design goals for GPSR, we
simulated the algorithm on a variety of static and mobile network
topologies. We focus mainly on the mobile simulation results in
this paper, as that part of the design space is more demanding of
a routing protocol—link additions and removals are far more fre-
quent under mobility. To compare the performance of GPSR with
prior work in wireless routing, we also simulate Johnson et al.’s
Dynamic Source Routing, DSR [12], [19], which has been shown
to offer higher packet delivery ratios and lower routing protocol
overhead than several other ad-hoc routing protocols [4].
3.1 Simulation Environment
We simulated GPSR in ns-2 [26], using the wireless extensions de-
veloped at Carnegie Mellon [25]. This simulation environment of-
fers high fidelity, as it includes full simulation of the IEEE 802.11
physical and MAC layers. Moreover, by using the same simula-
tion code base as the measurement study used to evaluate DSR [4],
we ensure our results are directly comparable to those published
previously.
The ns-2 wireless simulation model simulates nodes moving in an
unobstructed plane. Motion follows the random waypoint model [4]:
a node chooses a destination uniformly at random in the simulated
region, chooses a velocity uniformly at random from a configurable
range, and then moves to that destination at the chosen velocity.
Upon arriving at the chosen waypoint, the node pauses for a con-
figurable period before repeating the same process. In this model,
the pause time acts as a proxy for the degree of mobility in a sim-
ulation; longer pause time amounts to more nodes being stationary
for more of the simulation.
In the simulations where we compare GPSR with DSR, we use sim-
ulation parameters identical to a subset of those used by Broch et
al. [4]. Our simulations are for networks of 50, 112, and 200 nodes
with 802.11 WaveLAN radios, with a nominal 250-meter range.
The nodes are initially placed uniformly at random in a rectangular
region. All nodes move according to the random waypoint model,
with a maximum velocity of 20 m/s. We simulate pause times of
0, 30, 60, and 120 seconds, the highest mobility cases, as they are
the most demanding of a routing algorithm. Broch at al. also simu-
lated 300-, 600-, and 900-second pause times, perhaps in large part
because two of the routing algorithms they evaluated (DSDV and
TORA) performed well in these cases. We simulate 30 CBR traffic
flows, originated by 22 sending nodes. Each CBR flow sends at
2 Kbps, and uses 64-byte packets. Broch et al. simulated a wider
range of flow counts (10, 20, and 30 flows); we simulate only the
30-flow case as this case makes the greatest demands on the rout-
ing protocols: the most data traffic to forward and most destina-
tions to which to route. Each simulation lasts for 900 seconds of
simulated time. We simulate at each pause time with six different
randomly generated motion patterns, and present the mean of each
metric over these six runs. Because we only simulate the high mo-
bility cases, and motion patterns during each run are random, there

200 3000 m  600 m 1 node / 9000 m2 30
Table 2: Simulated Topology Characteristics
was little variance in the results among these runs. Runs with more
static topologies would be much more sensitive to node placement.
Table 2 summarizes the three network sizes we simulate.
These Broch et al. simulated networks are quite dense; the y di-
mension of the space in which nodes are distributed in their 50-
node simulations is only 50 meters larger than the simulated radio
range. On average, there is one node per 9,000 square meters in
these simulations. A radio range is nearly 200,000 square meters.
As a result, there are an average of approximately 20 neighbors
within range of the average node in these networks. DSR’s caching
of overheard routes gives great benefit in such dense topologies.
And GPSR can use greedy mode to forward the vast majority of
packets.
Our simulations do not include a distributed location database for
annotating packets with destinations’ positions. Our results here ar-
gue that the GPSR approach to routing warrants investigation into
efficient location databases, and related work is already underway
in this area [18]. In these simulation results, we use an idealized
location database: each source annotates packets it originates with
the true location of the destination. In this sense, our results rep-
resent the lowest control packet load that can be expected from
GPSR. Section 3.7 discusses GPSR’s interaction with a location
database further.
Before gathering the measurement results we present here, we val-
idated the GPSR implementation extensively by running it on hun-
dreds of non-mobile topologies, over an ideal MAC layer (the Null
MAC [25]), a 2 Mbps, contention-free network. Our goal in these
tests is to achieve 100% delivery success to demonstrate that the
GPSR code makes correct forwarding decisions. After reaching
this 100% goal on the Null MAC, we validated the GPSR imple-
mentation on these non-mobile topologies atop the ns 802.11 MAC
layer, to verify GPSR’s response to MAC transmit failure callbacks.
We evaluate GPSR and DSR using three metrics: packet deliv-
ery success rate, routing protocol overhead, and optimality of path
lengths taken by data packets.
3.2 Packet Delivery Success Rate
Figure 9 shows how many application packets GPSR delivers suc-
cessfully for varying values of B, the beaconing interval, as a func-
tion of pause time. The same figure for DSR is included for com-
parison. Note the narrow range of values on the y axis; all algo-
rithms on this graph deliver over 97% of user packets. Only packets
for which a path exists to the destination are included in the graph;
delivery failure to a truly disconnected destination does not repre-
sent failure of a routing algorithm. However, as mentioned above,
disconnection of a node is extremely rare in these simulations, as
connectivity is dense. As one would expect, the decrease in pre-
cision of neighbor lists caused by the longer beaconing interval of
3 seconds results in a slightly reduced delivery success rate. But
it appears that there is little added benefit, for the simulated mo-

bility rates and radio ranges, in decreasing B beyond 1.5. At all
pause times simulated, GPSR delivers a slightly greater fraction of
packets successfully than DSR.
3.3 Routing Protocol Overhead
Figure 10 shows the routing protocol overhead, measured in total
number of routing protocol packets sent network-wide during the
entire simulation, for GPSR with varying B and for DSR. Because
GPSR’s beacons are sent pro-actively (modulo data traffic with pig-
gybacked position information), each beaconing interval results in
a constant level of routing protocol traffic, independent of pause
time (and though we didn’t simulate it, number of traffic flows, un-
til application traffic becomes heavy enough to allow nodes never to
send beacon packets). Because DSR is a reactive routing protocol,
it generates increased routing protocol traffic as mobility increases.
We note with puzzlement that while we believe we run the exact
same DSR simulator code as Broch et al., we observe somewhat
greater traffic load from DSR than they did in the 30-flow DSR
simulations in [4]. To compare with these prior published results,
we include a second DSR curve, DSR-Broch, in Figure 10. Again,
our results, both for GPSR and DSR, represent means of 6 simu-
lation runs. We see little variance in the individual run results; at
these four shortest pause times, there is less simulation sensitivity
to the particular random node placement than there is in longer-
pause-time simulations. In any event, the contour of their reported
curve is the same as that of our DSR curve, and GPSR with B = 1:5
offers between a threefold and fourfold overhead reduction under
DSR. The contour of the DSR and GPSR curves suggests that as
mobility increases further, GPSR may offer greater savings in rout-
ing protocol overhead.
3.4 Path Length
Figure 11 gives a histogram of the number of hops beyond the ideal
true shortest path length in which GPSR and DSR deliver all suc-
cessfully delivered packets. The data are presented as percentages
of all packets delivered across all six 50-node simulations of GPSR
(B = 1:5) and DSR at pause time zero, where topological informa-
tion available to both algorithms is least current. Here, the “0” bin
counts packets delivered in the optimal, true-shortest-path number
of hops, and successive bins count packets that took one hop longer,
two hops longer, &c.

Figure 11: Path length beyond optimal for GPSR’s and DSR’s
successfully delivered packets. 50 nodes.
GPSR delivers the vast majority of packets in the optimal number
of hops. Intuitively, on a dense radio network, greedy forward-
ing approximates shortest-path routing. GPSR delivers 97% of its
packets along optimal-length paths, vs. 84.9% for DSR. This dif-
ference is attributable to DSR’s caching, which reduces the propa-
gation of route requests, but causes sub-optimal cached paths to be
used for forwarding until the cached route breaks.
3.5 Effect of Network Diameter
Figures 12 and 13 present packet delivery ratio and overhead re-
sults for larger-scale, 112- and 200-node networks with identical
traffic sources and node density. The 200-node results include only
one data point each (still the average of six runs with different ran-
domly generated motion patterns), at pause time 0, because simu-
lating 200-node networks is so computationally expensive. In these
simulations, the regions on which nodes move are 2250 by 450 me-
ters and 3000 by 600 meters, respectively, such that the number of
square meters per node (9000 m2/node) remains the same as that in
the 50-node simulations. The intent in these simulations is to eval-
uate the scaling of DSR and GPSR as network diameter increases.
When routes are longer, the probability of a route’s breaking in-
creases. The traffic sources are the same as in the smaller network
simulations: 30 CBR sources of 2 Kbps each, transmitting 64-byte

packets. We also include the same performance curves for the 50-
node network, for comparison.
Note that in Figure 13, the y axis is log-scaled. For each number
of nodes, GPSR’s traffic overhead once again remains flat, as it
is a non-reactive protocol. At a constant node density, network
diameter has no effect on GPSR’s local routing protocol message
traffic, since GPSR never sends routing packets beyond a single
hop. This particular metric, network-wide count of routing protocol
packets, shows the GPSR beacon traffic to be linear in node count,
as compared with the 50-node simulations. DSR’s traffic overhead
is significantly larger on the wider-diameter, 112- and 200-node
networks, as the protocol must propagate source route information
along the full length of a route. DSR’s caching of routes does not
avoid this significant message complexity increase.
GPSR’s traffic delivery ratio remains high at all pause times on
these larger-scale networks. It is GPSR’s use of only local topol-
ogy information that allows the protocol to maintain this delivery
ratio; there is no penalty for GPSR as the path length from source
to destination lengthens. Moreover, GPSR recovers from loss of a
neighbor by greedily forwarding to another appropriate neighbor;
this failover is instantaneous. DSR’s delivery ratio decreases con-
siderably in the wider-diameter network, owing to DSR’s need to
maintain full, end-to-end source routes.
Note that the maximum path lengths between nodes in these wider-
diameter simulations are still under 16 nodes. We mention this fact
as the DSR simulator code uses a compile-time constant for the
maximum length of a route it will discover, and maximum propa-
gation distance for route requests.
In these 112- and 200-node runs, DSR’s 64-route cache is full at
virtually every node. While the number of destinations in the net-
work is only 30 in our simulations, DSR caches multiple routes per
destination, and might profit from being able to cache more routes,
though at the expense of increased per-router state (see the next
section).
3.6 State per Router
When measuring state per router, the relevant metric is the number
of nodes in a router’s tables—not the number of routes. Because
DSR uses source routes, each route stored by a DSR router requires

storage for each node along the route.
We measure DSR’s average per-node state for the set of 200-node
simulations with pause time 0. Because the state maintained by
a node in these networks changes constantly, we take a snapshot
at time 300.0 seconds in each of our 900-second simulations, and
measure the state in use by each node at that instant. A GPSR node
stores state for 26 nodes on average in the pause-time-0, 200-node
simulations. This figure depends on node density, as the only state
a GPSR router keeps is an entry for each of its single-hop radio
neighbors.
In comparison, the average DSR node in our 200-node, pause-time-
0 simulation stores state for 266 nodes. It should be noted that
this value for DSR is clamped by the fixed-size route cache in the
DSR simulator’s implementation; this cache is limited to 64 routes.
While DSR might profit in robustness from a larger route cache,
the state cost per node will increase dramatically as the network
size increases, and increasingly many more diverse routes are dis-
covered. A DSR larger route cache may also store more broken
routes, as mobility and network diameter increase.
Each node stored in a GPSR router’s neighbor table arguably re-
quires more storage than a node stored in a DSR router’s table, as
GPSR routers must track the positions and addresses of their neigh-
bors, while DSR routers need only track the addresses of hops in
a source route. GPSR uses 12 bytes for each neighbor in its ta-
ble; two 4-byte floating point values for position coordinates, and
4 bytes for address. DSR uses 4 bytes per address. However, this
is a constant factor difference, dominated by far by the number of
nodes stored.
3.7 Location Database Overhead
The addition of location registration and lookup traffic for a lo-
cation database will increase GPSR’s overhead. For bidirectional
traffic flows between end nodes, a location database lookup will of-
ten need only be performed by the connection initiator at the start
of a connection; thereafter, both connection endpoints keep one an-
other apprised of their changing locations by stamping their current
locations in each data packet they transmit. In this case, the actual
location database lookup is a one-time, DNS-like lookup.
It is important to note that GPSR decouples participation in routing
as a forwarder from participation in the location database. Only
nodes that are traffic destinations need send location updates to
the database, and only nodes that originate traffic need send lo-
cation queries to it. In a dense sensor network [13], it is easy to
imagine configuring only a small subset of sensor nodes to take
measurements at only the current points of interest, by flooding
a few configuration packets through the network. The remain-
der of the sensor network can provide a robust transit network for
the collection of measurements from sensors to the measurement
point, with GPSR’s beacons as their only routing protocol traffic—
without generating any traffic to and from the location database.
In some networks, a destination may inherently have a well-known
location. For example, the position of one or more fixed data col-
lection points for a sensor network may be known to all sensors, in
which case no location database is needed.
It is also important to note that queries and registrations for the
location database are routable using GPSR itself; the queries and
registrations are geographically addressed. In the next section, we
cite a location database system built on geographic addressing.
4. RELATED WORK
Finn [7] is the earliest we know to propose greedy routing using the
locations of nodes. He recognizes the small forwarding state greedy
forwarding requires, and observes the failure of greedy forwarding
upon reaching a local maximum. He proposes flooding search for
a closer node as a strategy for recovering from local maxima.
We first propose greedy forwarding and perimeter traversal in [16],
as briefly discussed in Section 2.2. This work simulates this older
algorithm on static networks, in a very idealized (contentionless,
infinite bandwidth) simulator, and presents the state per node (in-
cluding perimeter node lists, notably absent from the current work),
message cost from cold start to convergence, and frequency with
which routes are not found, because of the imperfect no-crossing
heuristic. This prior work does not offer any mobile simulation
results, and the earlier algorithm suffers in many ways from its
maintenance of state beyond neighbor lists at all routers: increased
state size for perimeter lists at all nodes, periodic pro-active rout-
ing protocol traffic that perimeter probes generate, and staleness of
perimeter lists that would occur under mobility. The unreachability
of even a small fraction of destinations on static networks because
of the failure of the no-crossing heuristic is also problematic; such
routing failures are permanent, not transitory.
Johnson and Maltz [12] propose the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)
protocol. DSR generates routing traffic reactively: a router floods
a route request packet throughout the network. When the request
reaches the destination, the destination returns a route reply to the
request’s originator. Nodes aggressively cache routes that they learn,
so that intermediate nodes between a querier and destination may
subsequently reply on behalf of the destination, and limit the prop-
agation of requests.
Broch et al. [4] compare the performance of the DSDV, TORA,
DSR, and AODV routing protocols on a simulated mobile IEEE
802.11 network. They simulate networks of 50 nodes, under a
range of mobility rates and traffic loads. Their measurements show
the effectiveness of DSR’s caching in minimizing DSR’s routing
protocol traffic on these 50-node networks. In the interest of com-
parability of results, we use this work’s simulation environment for
IEEE 802.11, a two-ray ground reflection model, and DSR.
Ko and Vaidya [17] describe Location Aided Routing (LAR), an
optimization to DSR in which nodes limit the propagation of route
request packets to the geographic region where it is most proba-
ble the destination is located. LAR uses base DSR to establish first
connectivity with a destination; thereafter, a route querier learns the
destination’s location directly from the destination node, and uses
this information to mark route requests for propagation only within
a region of some size about the destination’s last known position.
Like DSR’s caching, LAR is a strategy for limiting the propagation
of route requests. When a circuitous path, outside the region LAR
limits route request propagation within, becomes the only path to
a destination, LAR reverts to DSR’s flooding-with-caching base
case. Under LAR, DSR’s routes are still end-to-end source routes.
Geography is not used for data packet forwarding decisions under
LAR; only to scope routing protocol packet propagation.
Li et al. [18] propose GLS, a scalable and robust location database
that geographically addresses queries and registrations. Their sys-
tem dynamically selects multiple database servers to store each
node’s location, for robustness against server failure. This property
also ensures that a cluster of nodes partitioned from the remainder
of the network continues to have location database service, pro-
vided by nodes inside the cluster. GLS uses a geographic hierarchy
to serve queries at a server topologically close to the querier.
Bose et al. [3] independently investigated the graph algorithms for
rendering a radio network’s graph planar. They suggest the Gabriel
Graph, and analyze the increase in path length over shortest paths
when traversing a graph using only perimeters. Motivated by the
longer-than-optimal paths perimeter traversal alone finds, they sug-
gest combining planar graph traversal with greedy forwarding, and
verify that this combination produces path lengths closer to true
shortest paths. They do not present a routing protocol, do not sim-
ulate a network at the packet level, and assume that all nodes are
stationary and reachable.
5. FUTURE WORK
One assumption in the use of planar perimeters we would like to
investigate further is that a node can reach all other nodes within its
radio range. The GG and RNG planarizations both rely on a node’s
ability to accurately know if there is a witness w within radio range,
when considering elimination of an edge to a known neighbor. Our
use of the GG and RNG can disconnect a graph with particular
patterns of obstacles between nodes. This disconnection is easily
avoided by forcing the pair of nodes bordering an edge to agree on
the edge’s fate, with the rule that both nodes must decide to elim-
inate the edge, or neither will do so. However, this modification
to the planarization algorithms will make the RNG and GG pla-
narizations leave one or more crossing edges in these regions with
obstacles. We intend to study these cases further. One promising
approach in dealing with such obstacles may be to have obstructed
nodes choose a reachable partner node elsewhere in the network,
and route via the partner for destinations that are unreachable be-
cause of local failure of the planarization.
While we have shown herein the benefits of geography as a tool
for scalable routing systems, measuring the combined behavior of
GPSR and a location database system will reveal more about the
costs of using geography for routing. An efficient distributed loca-
tion database would provide a network service useful in many other
location-aware computing applications.
A comparison of the behavior of GPSR using the RNG and GG
planarizations would reveal the performance effects of the tradeoff
between the greater traffic concentration that occurs in perimeter
forwarding on the sparser RNG, vs. the increased spatial diversity
that the RNG offers by virtue of its sparsity. Even outside the con-
text of GPSR, it may be the case that limiting edges used for for-
warding in a radio network to those on the RNG or GG may reduce
contention and improve efficiency on MAC protocols sensitive to
the number of sending stations in mutual range.
We hope to extend GPSR for hosts placed in three-dimensional
space, beyond the flat topologies explored in this paper. A promis-
ing approach is to implement perimeter forwarding for 3-D volumes
rather than 2-D faces.
6. CONCLUSION
We have presented Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing, GPSR, a
routing algorithm that uses geography to achieve small per-node
routing state, small routing protocol message complexity, and ex-
tremely robust packet delivery on densely deployed wireless net-
works. Our simulations on mobile networks with up to 200 nodes
over a full IEEE 802.11 MAC demonstrate these properties: GPSR
consistently delivers upwards of 94% of data packets successfully;
it is competitive with DSR in this respect on 50-node networks at
all pause times, and increasingly more successful than DSR as the
number of nodes increases, as demonstrated on 112-node and 200-
node networks. GPSR generates routing protocol traffic in a quan-
tity independent of the length of the routes through the network,
and therefore generates a constant, low volume of routing protocol
messages as mobility increases, yet doesn’t suffer from decreased
robustness in finding routes. DSR must query longer routes as the
network diameter increases, and must do so more often as mo-
bility increases, and caching becomes less effective. Thus, DSR
generates drastically more routing protocol traffic in our 200-node
and 112-node simulations than it does in our 50-node ones. Fi-
nally, GPSR keeps state proportional to the number of its neigh-
bors, while both traffic sources and intermediate DSR routers cache
state proportional to the product of the number of routes learned
and route length in hops.
GPSR’s benefits all stem from geographic routing’s use of only
immediate-neighbor information in forwarding decisions. Routing
protocols that rely on end-to-end state concerning the path between
a forwarding router and a packet’s destination, as do source-routed,
DV, and LS algorithms, face a scaling challenge as network diame-
ter in hops and mobility increase because the product of these two
factors determines the rate that end-to-end paths change. Hierarchy
and caching have proven successful in scaling these algorithms.
Geography, as exemplified in GPSR, represents another powerful
lever for scaling routing.
