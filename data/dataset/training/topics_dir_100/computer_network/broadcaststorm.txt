Abstract. Broadcasting is a common operation in a network to resolve many issues. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) in particular,
due to host mobility, such operations are expected to be executed more frequently (such as finding a route to a particular host, paging a
particular host, and sending an alarm signal). Because radio signals are likely to overlap with others in a geographical area, a straightforward
broadcasting by flooding is usually very costly and will result in serious redundancy, contention, and collision, to which we call the broadcast
storm problem. In this paper, we identify this problem by showing how serious it is through analyses and simulations. We propose several
schemes to reduce redundant rebroadcasts and differentiate timing of rebroadcasts to alleviate this problem. Simulation results are presented,
which show different levels of improvement over the basic flooding approach.

1. Introduction
The advancements in wireless communication and economi-
cal, portable computing devices have made mobile comput-
ing possible. One research issue that has attracted a lot of
attention recently is the design of mobile ad hoc networks
(MANET). A MANET is one consisting of a set of mobile
hosts which may communicate with one another and roam
around at their will. No base stations are supported in such
an environment. Due to considerations such as radio power
limitation, channel utilization, and power-saving concerns, a
mobile host may not be able to communicate directly with
other hosts in a single-hop fashion. In this case, a multihop
scenario occurs, where the packets sent by the source host
are relayed by several intermediate hosts before reaching the
destination host.
Applications of MANETs occur in situations like battle-
fields or major disaster areas where networks need to be de-
ployed immediately but base stations or fixed network in-
frastructures are not available. Unicast routing in MANET
has been studied in several articles [7,8,15,16,23,25]. A work-
ing group called “manet” has been formed by the Internet En-
gineering Task Force (IETF) to study the related issues and
stimulate research in MANET [22].
This paper studies the problem of sending a broadcast
message in a MANET. Broadcasting is a common operation
in many applications, e.g., graph-related problems and dis-
tributed computing problems. It is also widely used to re-
solve many network layer problems. In a MANET in par-
ticular, due to host mobility, broadcasting is expected to be
performed more frequently (e.g., for paging a particular host,
sending an alarm signal, and finding a route to a particular
host [7,15,16,25]). Broadcasting may also be used in LAN
emulation [3] or serve as a last resort to provide multicast ser-
vices in networks whose topologies change rapidly.
In this paper, we assume that mobile hosts in the MANET
share a single common channel with carrier sense multiple
access (CSMA), but no collision detection (CD), capability.
Synchronization in such a network with mobility is unlikely,
and global network topology information is unavailable to fa-
cilitate the scheduling of a broadcast. So one straightforward
and obvious solution is broadcasting by flooding. Unfortu-
nately, in this paper we observe that serious redundancy, con-
tention, and collision could exist if flooding is done blindly.
First, because the radio propagation is omni-directional and a
physical location may be covered by the transmission ranges
of several hosts, many rebroadcasts will be redundant. Sec-
ond, heavy contention could exist because rebroadcasting
hosts are probably close to each other. Third, collisions are
more likely to occur because the RTS/CTS dialogue is inap-
plicable and the timing of rebroadcasts is highly correlated.
Collectively, we refer to these problems associated with
flooding as the broadcast storm problem. Through analy-
ses and simulations, we demonstrate how serious the prob-
lem is. Two directions to alleviate this problem are to reduce
the possibility of redundant rebroadcasts and to differentiate
the timing of rebroadcasts. Following these directions, we
develop several schemes, called probabilistic, counter-based,

distance-based, location-based, and cluster-based schemes,
to facilitate MANET broadcasting. Simulation results are pre-
sented to study the effectiveness of these schemes.
To the best of our knowledge, the broadcast storm problem
has not been addressed in depth for MANET before. It is how-
ever worth summarizing some results for broadcasting that
are for other environments. Works in [4,5,10–12,21] assume
a packet-radio network environment. Most of these results
rely on time division multiple access (TDMA, which requires
timing synchronization) and certain levels of topology infor-
mation. Their goal is to find a slot assignment. Obtaining
an optimal assignment has been shown to be NP-hard [10].
The broadcast scheduling problem studied in [9,17,26,27],
although carrying a similar name, is not intended to solve
the problem addressed in this paper. Its goal is to assign a
contention-free time slot to each radio station.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 de-
fines and analyzes the broadcast storm problem. Mechanisms
to alleviate the storm are proposed in section 3. Simulation
results are presented in section 4 and conclusions are drawn
in section 5.
2. Preliminaries
2.1. Broadcasting in a MANET
A MANET consists of a set of mobile hosts that may com-
municate with one another from time to time. No base sta-
tions are supported. Each host is equipped with a CSMA/CA
(carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) [20]
transceiver. In such environment, a host may communicate
with another directly or indirectly. In the latter case, a multi-
hop scenario occurs, where the packets originating from the
source host are relayed by several intermediate hosts before
reaching the destination.
The broadcast problem refers to the sending of a message
to other hosts in the network. The problem considered here is
assumed to have the following characteristics.
• The broadcast is spontaneous. Any mobile host can issue
a broadcast message at any time. For reasons such as host
mobility and lack of synchronization, preparing any kind
of global topology knowledge is prohibitive (in fact this is
at least as hard as the broadcast problem). Little or even
no local connectivity information may be collected in ad-
vance.
• The broadcast is unreliable.1 No acknowledgement mech-
anism will be used.2 However, an attempt should be made
to distribute a broadcast message to as many hosts as pos-
sible without paying too much effort. The motivations to
1 A more strict one is reliable broadcast [1,24], whose goal is to ensure all
hosts receive the message. High-level acknowledgements between hosts
are exchanged. Such protocols are typically accomplished at the applica-
tion layer and are out of the scope of this paper. However, the result in this
paper may serve as an underlying facility to implement reliable broadcast.
2 The MAC specification in IEEE 802.11 [20] does not require acknowledge-
ment on receipt of broadcast packets.
make such an assumption are (i) a host may miss a broad-
cast message because it is off-line, it is temporarily iso-
lated from the network, or it experiences repetitive colli-
sions, (ii) acknowledgements may cause serious medium
contention (and thus, another “storm”) surrounding the
sender, and (iii) in many applications (e.g., route discovery
in [7,15,16,25]), a 100% reliable broadcast is unnecessary.
In addition, we assume that a host can detect duplicate
broadcast messages. This is essential to prevent endless flood-
ing of a message. One way to do so is to associate with each
broadcast message a tuple (source ID, sequence number) as
that in [7,25].
Finally, we comment that we do not confine ourselves
to the broadcasting of the same message.3 What we fo-
cus on in this paper is the message propagating behavior in
a MANET – the phenomenon where the transmission of a
packet will trigger other surrounding hosts to transmit the
same (or modified) packet. We shall show that if flooding
is used blindly, many redundant messages will be sent and
serious contention/collision will be incurred. Our goal is to
solve broadcast with efficiency in mind.
2.2. Broadcast storm caused by flooding
A straight-forward approach to perform broadcast is by flood-
ing. A host, on receiving a broadcast message for the first
time, has the obligation to rebroadcast the message. Clearly,
this costs n transmissions in a network of n hosts. In a
CSMA/CA network, drawbacks of flooding include:
• Redundant rebroadcasts. When a mobile host decides to
rebroadcast a broadcast message to its neighbors, all its
neighbors already have the message.
• Contention. After a mobile host broadcasts a message, if
many of its neighbors decide to rebroadcast the message,
these transmissions (which are all from nearby hosts) may
severely contend with each other.
• Collision. Because of the deficiency of backoff mecha-
nism, the lack of RTS/CTS dialogue, and the absence of
CD, collisions are more likely to occur and cause more
damage.
Collectively, we refer to the above phenomena as the broad-
cast storm problem. The following discussion shows how se-
rious the problem is through analyses.
2.2.1. Analysis of redundant rebroadcasts
We first use two examples to demonstrate how much redun-
dancy could be generated. In figure 1(a), it only takes two
transmissions for the white node to broadcast a message,
whereas four transmissions will be carried out if no attempt
is made to reduce redundancy. Figure 1(b) shows an even
3 For instance, the routing protocols in [7,15,16,25] rely on broadcasting a
UDP packet called route_request to search for a route from a source to a
particular destination. When propagating such a request, a host generally
appends its ID to the message so that appropriate routing information can
be collected.
THE BROADCAST STORM PROBLEM IN A MOBILE AD HOC NETWORK 155

between hosts is represented by links. White nodes are source hosts, and
gray nodes are relay hosts.
Figure 2. The signal overlapping problem corresponding to the scenario in
figure 1(b).
more serious scenario: only two transmissions are sufficient
to complete a broadcast as opposed to seven transmissions
caused by flooding.
The main reason for such redundancy is that radio sig-
nals from different antennas are very likely to overlap with
each other. Assuming that the area that can be covered by an
antenna forms a circle, we show in figure 2 the signal over-
lapping problem corresponding to the scenario in figure 1(b).
The gray levels in the figure indicate the levels of signal over-
lapping. As can be seen, many areas are covered by the same
broadcast packet more than once. In the worst case, an area
can be covered by the packet seven times.
In the following we will show through analyses that re-
broadcasts are very costly and should be used with caution.
First we consider the simple scenario in figure 3, where host A
sends a broadcast message, and host B decides to rebroad-
cast the message. Let SA and SB denote the circle areas
covered by A’s and B’s transmissions, respectively. The
additional area that can benefit from B’s rebroadcast is the
shaded region, denoted as SB−A. Let r be the radii of SA
and SB, and d the distance between A and B. We can derive
Figure 3. Analysis of the extra area that can benefit from a rebroadcast:
A sends a broadcast packet and B decides to rebroadcasts the packet.
|SB−A| = |SB|−|SA∩B| = πr2−INTC(d), where INTC(d) is
the intersection area of the two circles centered at two points
distanced by d ,
INTC(d) = 4
∫ r
d/2
√
r2 − x2 dx.
When d = r , the coverage area |SB−A| is the largest, which
equals
πr2 − INTC(r) = r2
(
π

+
√

)
≈ 0.61πr2.
This shows a surprising fact that a rebroadcast can provide
only 0–61% additional coverage over that already covered by
the previous transmission.
Also, we would like to know the average value of πr2 −
INTC(d). Suppose that B can randomly locate in any of A’s
transmission range; the average value can be obtained by in-
tegrating the above value over the circle of radius x centered
at A for x in [0, r]:
∫ r
0
2πx · [πr2 − INTC(x)]
πr2
dx ≈ 0.41πr2.
Thus, after the previous broadcast, a rebroadcast can cover
only additional 41% area on average.
Now consider the scenario of having received a broadcast
message twice: if host C decides to rebroadcast after it heard
A’s and B’s broadcasts. The area that can benefit from C’s
rebroadcast is SC−(A∪B). Through simulations by randomly
generating A and B on C’s transmission range, we found that
on average |SC−(A∪B)| ≈ 0.19πr2 (we remark that in the sim-
ulations the calculation of coverage was not derived by formal
calculus, but by discrete estimation, where the area was parti-
tioned into fine grids for approximation). This shows an even
dimmer prospect of hoping that rebroadcasts propagate the
message to new hosts.
In general, we would like to know the benefit of a host re-
broadcasting a message after hearing the message k times.
The result can be easily obtained from simulation by ran-
domly generating k hosts in a host X’s transmission range
and calculating the area covered by X excluding those areas
already covered by the other k hosts. Denote this value by
EAC(k) (EAC stands for expected additional coverage). Fig-
ure 4 shows our simulation result (again by grid estimation).
As can be seen, when k  4, the expected additional coverage
is below 5%.

Figure 4. Analysis on redundancy: the expected additional coverage EAC(k)
(divided by πr2) after a host heard a broadcast message k times.
2.2.2. Analysis of contention
To address the contention problem, consider the situation
where host A transmits a broadcast message and there are
n hosts hearing this message. If all these hosts try to rebroad-
cast the message, contention may occur because two or more
hosts around A are likely to be close and, thus, contend with
each other on the wireless medium.
Let us analyze the simpler case of n = 2. Let hosts B and
C be the two receiving hosts. Let B randomly locate within
A’s transmission range. In order for C to contend with B,
it must be located in the area SA∩B. So the probability of
contention is |SA∩B|/(πr2). Let x be the distance between
A and B. Integrating the above probability over the circle of
radius x centered at A for x in [0, r], the expected probability
of contention is
∫ r
0
2πx · INTC(x)/(πr2)
πr2
dx ≈ 59%.
Clearly, the contention is expected to be higher as n in-
creases. We derived a simulation by randomly generating n
hosts in A’s transmission range. We observe the probability
cf (n, k) that k hosts among these n hosts experience no con-
tention in their rebroadcasting (cf stands for contention-free).
The results are shown in figure 5. We can see that the prob-
ability of all n hosts experiencing contention (i.e., cf (n, 0))
increases quickly over 0.8 as n  6. So the more crowded
the area is, the more serious the contention is. On the other
hand, the probability of having one contention-free host (i.e.,
cf (n, 1)) drops sharply as n increases. Further, it is very un-
likely to have more contention-free hosts (i.e., cf (n, k) with
k  2). Note that having k = n − 1 contention-free hosts
implies having n such hosts, so cf (n, n − 1) = 0.
2.2.3. Analysis of collision
In a MANET, there is no base station or access point. There-
fore, in this paper we exclude the use of the point coordinate
function (PCF) described in the IEEE 802.11 MAC specifica-
tion [20], and study mainly the behavior under the distributed
coordinate function (DCF).
Figure 5. Analysis of contention: the probabilities of having k contention-
free hosts among n receiving hosts.
The CSMA/CA mechanism requires a host to start a back-
off procedure right after the host transmitted a message, or
when a host wants to transmit but the medium is busy and
the previous backoff has been done. To perform a backoff, a
counter is first set to an integer randomly picked from its cur-
rent backoff window. If the channel clear assessment (CCA)
mechanism of the host detects no channel activity during the
past slot (a fixed period), the counter is decreased by one.
When the counter reaches zero, the backoff procedure is fin-
ished.
Now consider the scenario where several neighbor hosts
hear a broadcast from host X. There are several reasons for
collisions to occur. First, if the surrounding medium of X
has been quiet for enough long, all of X’s neighbors may
have passed their backoff procedures. Thus, after hearing the
broadcast message (and having passed the DIFS period), they
may all start rebroadcasting at around the same time. This
is especially true if carriers can not be sensed immediately
due to such as RF delays and transmission latency. Second,
because the RTS/CTS forewarning dialogue is not used in a
broadcast transmission, the damage of collision is more seri-
ous. Third, once collision occurs, without collision detection
(CD), a host will keep transmitting the packet even if some
of its foregoing bits have been garbled. And the longer the
packet is, the more the waste.
The above problem is not addressed in the ordinary IEEE
802.11 MAC activities, possibly because the one-to-many
communication behavior is not considered therein. For all the
above reasons, we believe that the broadcast storm problem
deserves serious study in a MANET environment.
3. Mechanisms to reduce redundancy, contention, and
collision
One approach to alleviating the broadcast storm problem is to
inhibit some hosts from rebroadcasting to reduce the redun-
THE BROADCAST STORM PROBLEM IN A MOBILE AD HOC NETWORK 157
dancy, and thus, contention and collision. In the following, we
present five schemes to do so. These schemes differ in how
a mobile host estimates redundancy and how it accumulates
knowledge to assist in making its decision. Except the last
scheme, which relies on some local connectivity information,
all schemes operate in a fully distributed manner.
3.1. Probabilistic scheme
An intuitive way to reduce rebroadcasts is to use probabilistic
rebroadcasting. On receiving a broadcast message for the first
time, a host will rebroadcast it with probability P . Clearly,
when P = 1, this scheme is equivalent to flooding.
Note that to respond to the contention and collision prob-
lems addressed in sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, we should insert a
small random delay (a number of slots) before rebroadcasting
the message, so the timing of rebroadcasting can be differen-
tiated.
3.2. Counter-based scheme
When a host tries to rebroadcast a message, the rebroadcast
message may be blocked by a busy medium, the backoff pro-
cedure, and other queued messages. There is a chance for the
host to hear the same message again and again from other re-
broadcasting hosts before the host actually starts transmitting
the message.
In section 2.2.1 we have shown that EAC(k), the expected
additional coverage after hearing the message k times, is ex-
pected to decrease quickly as k increases. We can prevent a
host from rebroadcasting when the expected additional cov-
erage of the host’s rebroadcast becomes too low. This is
what the counter-based scheme is based on. Specifically,
a counter c is used to keep track of the number of times the
broadcast message is received. A counter threshold C is cho-
sen. Whenever c  C, the rebroadcast is inhibited. The
scheme is formally derived below.
S1. Initialize counter c = 1 when a broadcast message msg
is heard for the first time. In S2, if msg is heard again,
interrupt the waiting and perform S4.
S2. Wait for a random number of slots. Then submit msg
for transmission and wait until the transmission actually
starts.
S3. The message is on the air. The procedure exits.
S4. Increase c by one. If c < C, resume the interrupted wait-
ing in S2. Otherwise c = C, proceed to S5.
S5. Cancel the transmission of msg if it was submitted in S2.
The host is prohibited from rebroadcasting the same mes-
sage in the future. Then the procedure exits.
Note that in S4, by “resume the interrupted waiting in S2”,
we mean that the host should go back to step S2 and wait for
the remaining amount of time that it should have done after
the point of interruption.
3.3. Distance-based scheme
In the previous scheme, a counter is used to decide whether
to drop a rebroadcast or not. In this scheme, we will use the
relative distance between hosts to make the decision.
For instance, suppose host H heard a broadcast message
from S for the first time. If the distance, say d , between H and
S is very small, there is little additional coverage H’s rebroad-
cast can provide. If d is larger, the additional coverage will
be larger. In the extreme case, if d = 0, the additional cov-
erage is 0 too. Earlier, we analyzed the relationship between
the distance d and the additional coverage πr2 − INTC(d).
So this can be used as a metric by H to determine whether to
rebroadcast or not.
Now, suppose that before a rebroadcast message is actu-
ally sent, host H has heard the same message several times.
Let dmin be the distance to the nearest host from which the
same message is heard. Then H’s rebroadcast will provide
additional coverage no more than πr2 − INTC(dmin). In our
distance-based scheme, we will use dmin as the metric to eval-
uate whether to rebroadcast or not. If dmin is smaller than
some distance threshold D, the rebroadcast transmission of
H is cancelled. The scheme is formally derived below. In
section 4, we will test several possible values of D.
S1. When a broadcast message msg is heard for the first time,
initialize dmin to the distance to the broadcasting host. If
dmin < D, proceed to S5. In S2, if msg is heard again,
interrupt the waiting and perform S4.
S2. Wait for a random number of slots. Then submit msg
for transmission and wait until the transmission actually
starts.
S3. The message is on the air. The procedure exits.
S4. Update dmin if the distance to the host from which msg is
heard is smaller. If dmin < D, proceed to S5. Otherwise,
resume the interrupted waiting in S2.
S5. Cancel the transmission of msg if it was submitted in S2.
The host is prohibited from rebroadcasting the same mes-
sage in the future. Then the procedure exits.
Below, we comment on how to obtain the distance infor-
mation. One possibility is to estimate from the signal strength
of a received message. Specifically, let Pt and Pr be the power
levels at which a message is sent and received, respectively.
According to [28], Pr = Pt(c1/d)nc2, where n, c1, and c2
are constants related to the physical environment, the carrier’s
wavelength, and antenna gains, respectively. Since Pr and Pt
can be measured, the distance d can be estimated from this
formula.
Having understood the relationship between the distance
and the power, we can even directly replace the role of dis-
tances by signal strengths by establishing a signal-strength
threshold. As a comment, we note that signal strength infor-
mation was also used in [13] to facilitate routing in a MANET.

(b) X is outside of the polygon. (c) Analysis of maximum loss of additional coverage on using the polygon test.
3.4. Location-based scheme
Earlier we have used the number of times that a broadcast
message has been heard or the distances to sending hosts as
our rebroadcasting metrics. If we can acquire the locations
of those broadcasting hosts, it is even possible to estimate the
additional coverage more precisely. Such an approach may be
supported by positioning devices such as GPS (Global Posi-
tioning System) receivers [18]. We note that location informa-
tion was also used to facilitate route discovery in a MANET
[6,19].
Without loss of generality, let a host’s location be (0, 0)
(here we use xy-coordinates to facilitate our presentation; in
fact, devices such as GPS receivers can provide 3-D locations
in longitude, latitude, and altitude). Suppose a host has re-
ceived the same broadcast message from k hosts located at
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xk, yk). We can calculate the addi-
tional area that can be covered provided that the host rebroad-
casts the message. Let AC((x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xk, yk))
denote the additional coverage divided by πr2. Then we
can compare this value to a predefined coverage threshold
A (0 < A < 0.61) to determine whether the receiving host
should rebroadcast or not. The scheme is formally derived
below.
S1. When a broadcast message msg is heard for the first time,
initialize AC to the additional coverage provided by the
host’s rebroadcast. If AC < A, proceed to S5. In S2, if
msg is heard again, interrupt the waiting and perform S4.
S2. Wait for a random number of slots. Then submit msg
for transmission and wait until the transmission actually
starts.
S3. The message is on the air. The procedure exits.
S4. Update AC. If AC < A, proceed to S5. Otherwise, re-
sume the interrupted waiting in S2.
S5. Cancel the transmission of msg if it was submitted in S2.
The host is prohibited from rebroadcasting the same mes-
sage in the future. Then the procedure exits.
One obstacle to using the above scheme is the cost of cal-
culating AC, which is related to calculating many intersection
areas among several circles. This problem is difficult already
when there are four circles. One possibility is to use a grid-
filling approximation to estimate its value.
An alternative is using a convex polygon to determine
whether a rebroadcast should be carried out or not. For in-
stance, suppose host X received a broadcast message three
times from hosts A, B, and C. In figure 6(a), it shows that
if X is inside the convex polygon formed by connecting the
centers of A, B, and C, the additional coverage of X’s re-
broadcast is small or even none. On the contrary, as shown in
figure 6(b), if X is not in the polygon, it is likely that the re-
broadcast will provide more additional coverage (the shaded
area). These observations suggest that we can allow the host
to rebroadcast only if it is not located within the convex poly-
gon.
The following justifies the reason for the above convex ap-
proximation through geometry calculation. We show that if
the polygon test prevents a host X from rebroadcasting (X is
within the polygon), at most 22% of coverage will be lost in
the extreme case. Observe that the additional coverage will be
the largest when X is located on some boundary of the poly-
gon. Let A and B be the two end points of that boundary. We
see that the additional coverage will be the largest if A and
B are each separated from X by the transmission range r as
illustrated in figure 6(c). It is not hard to find that the size of
the shaded area in figure 6(c) is

)
r2 ≈ 0.22πr2.
Now it is reasonable to say that if a host is in the convex
polygon formed by the locations of previously sending hosts,
the additional coverage that the host can provide is well be-
low 22%.
3.5. Cluster-based scheme
The above schemes are based on statistical and geometric
modeling to estimate the additional coverage of a rebroadcast.
In the following, we show how to develop an approach based
on graph modeling. Specifically, we will adopt the cluster-
ing concept of [2,16] to derive our scheme. Note that the
clustering technique has been used to solve other problems
THE BROADCAST STORM PROBLEM IN A MOBILE AD HOC NETWORK 159
Figure 7. A MANET with three clusters.
in MANETs (e.g., traffic coordination [14], routing [14], and
fault-tolerance [1]).
We first summarize the cluster formation algorithm pro-
posed in [16]. It is assumed that a host periodically sends
packets to advertise its presence. Thus any host can deter-
mine its connectivity with other hosts on its own. Each host
has a unique ID. A cluster is a set of hosts formed as follows.
A host with a local minimal ID will elect itself as a cluster
head. This head host together with its neighbors will form a
cluster. These neighbor hosts are called members of the clus-
ter. Within a cluster, a member that can communicate with
a host in another cluster is a gateway. To take mobility into
account, when two heads meet, the one with a larger ID gives
up its head role. Figure 7 shows an example of a clustered
MANET.
Now back to our broadcast storm problem. We assume
that clusters have been formed in the MANET and will be
maintained regularly by the underlying cluster formation pro-
tocol. In a cluster, the head’s rebroadcast can cover all other
hosts in that cluster if its transmission experiences no colli-
sion. Apparently, to propagate the broadcast message to hosts
in other clusters, gateway hosts should take the responsibility.
But there is no need for a non-gateway member to rebroadcast
the message. Based on these observations, our cluster-based
scheme is formally developed as follows.
S1. When a broadcast message msg is heard for the first time,
if the host is a non-gateway member, the rebroadcast is
prohibited and the procedure exits. Otherwise, the host is
either a head or a gateway. Proceed to S2.
S2. Use any of the probabilistic, counter-based, distance-
based, and location-based schemes to determine whether
to rebroadcast or not.
Note that the above scheme is derived by incorporating any
of the schemes developed earlier into it. Step S1 is to prevent
non-gateway members from rebroadcasting. As a cluster may
still have many gateway members, step S2 then further uti-
lizes other knowledge (such as additional coverage) to reduce
the number of rebroadcasts.
4. Performance simulation
We have developed a simulator using C++. Central to the
simulator is a discrete event-driven engine designed to simu-
late systems that can be modeled by processes communicating
through signals. A simplified version of the MAC specifica-
tion in IEEE 801.11 is referenced to simulate the CSMA/CA
behavior among hosts.
The fixed parameters in our simulations are the transmis-
sion radius (500 m), the broadcast packet size (280 bytes), the
transmission rate (1M bits per second), and the DSSS physi-
cal layer timing (PLCP overhead, slot time, inter-frame sepa-
rations, backoff window sizing, as suggested in IEEE 801.11).
A geometric area called a map which contains 100 mobile
hosts is simulated. A map can be of size 1 × 1, 3 × 3, 5 × 5,
7 × 7, 9 × 9, or 11 × 11 units, where a unit is of length 500 m
(the transmission radius). Initially, hosts are randomly dis-
tributed over a map. To simulate host mobility, each host will
roam around randomly in the map during the simulation. The
roaming pattern of a host is simulated by generating a series
of turns. In each turn, a direction, a velocity, and a time in-
terval are generated. The direction is uniformly distributed
from 0◦ to 360◦, and the time interval uniformly distributed
from 1 to 100 s. The velocity is randomly chosen from 0 to
10 km/h in a 1 × 1 map, and similarly from 0 to 30 km/h
in a 3 × 3 map, from 0 to 50 km/h in a 5 × 5 map, from
0 to 90 km/h in a 9 × 9 map, and from 0 to 110 km/h in a
11 × 11 map, respectively. The arrival rate for the whole map
is one broadcast request per second, and the broadcasting host
is randomly picked for each request. Recall that we need to
differentiate the timing of rebroadcasting. A small random
delay ranging from 0 to 31 slots is inserted before each at-
tempt at rebroadcasting (for instance, refer to step S2 of the
counter-based scheme in section 3.2).
The performance metrics to be observed are:
• REachability (RE): the number of mobile hosts receiving
the broadcast message divided by the total number of mo-
bile hosts that are reachable,4 directly or indirectly, from
the source host.
• Saved ReBroadcast (SRB): (r − t)/r , where r is the num-
ber of hosts receiving the broadcast message, and t is the
number of hosts that actually transmitted the message.
• Average latency: the interval from the time the broadcast
was initiated to the time the last host finished its rebroad-
casting.
4.1. Performance of the probabilistic, counter-based,
distance-based, location-based, and cluster-based
schemes
The simulation results of the probabilistic, counter-based,
distance-based, location-based, and cluster-based schemes
are shown in figures 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, respectively. Each
value in these figures is obtained through a simulation run of
10,000 broadcast requests.
Figure 8(a) shows the observed RE and SRB when apply-
ing the probabilistic scheme. In a small map (which implies
a dense host distribution), a small probability P is sufficient
to achieve high reachability. But a larger P is needed if the

host distribution is sparse. The amount of saving (SRB) de-
creases, roughly proportionally to (1 − P), as P increases.
Also, note that the performance of broadcasting by flooding
can be found at the position where the probability P = 1.
Figure 8(b) shows the broadcast latency at various P values.
Interestingly, a MANET with sparser hosts tends to complete
broadcasting more quickly than one with denser hosts. The
reason is probably due to the heavier contention on the chan-
nel in denser networks.
Figure 9 shows the performance of the counter-based
scheme. From figure 9(a), we see that the reachability RE in
fact reaches about the same level when the counter threshold
C  3. Note that when C is large enough (such as C = 6),
the network’s behavior is very close to one using flooding to
broadcast. However, various levels of SRB can be obtained
over the flooding scheme, depending on the density of hosts
in a map. For instance, in denser maps (e.g., 1 × 1, 3 × 3,
and 5 × 5) this scheme can offer 27–67% of SRB at C = 3,
whereas in sparser maps (e.g., 7 × 7, 9 × 9, and 11 × 11) the
scheme can offer 8–20% of SRB. When the map is very sparse
(say 11 × 11) and C is very large (say 6), the amount of sav-
ing decreases sharply, because the number of neighbors of a
host becomes very small (2.4 neighbors per host in an 11×11
map in average). Under such conditions, it is less likely that
a host will receive the same broadcast message more than C
times. We recommend that a threshold C of 3 or 4 is probably
a reasonable choice.
The performance of the distance-based scheme is shown in
figure 10. Note that the values of threshold D in the figure are
chosen purposely to make a reasonable comparison between
the distance-based scheme and the counter-based scheme. For
instance, when C = 2, we know that EAC(2) ≈ 0.187 from
figure 4. So we choose a D to match this value of addition
coverage, i.e., (πr2−INTC(D))/(πr2) ≈ 0.187. This gives a
D = 147. The other D values along the x-axis in figure 10 are
derived in a similar way. Note that when D is small enough
(such as D = 11), the network’s behavior is very close to one
using flooding to broadcast.

Figure 11. Performance of the location-based scheme. (a) Coverage threshold A versus reachability RE (shown in lines) and saved rebroadcast SRB (shown

By comparing figures 9(a) and 10(a), we observe that the
distance-based scheme can provide better reachability. But
not many rebroadcasts are saved – its SRB values are worse
than those of the counter-based scheme. Also, its broad-
cast latency is higher than that of the counter-based scheme,
as shown in figures 9(b) and 10(b). The reason that the
distance-based scheme saves less among of rebroadcasts than
the counter-based scheme is as follows. In the distance-
based scheme, a host may have heard a broadcast message
many times but still decide to rebroadcast the message be-
cause none of the transmission distances are below the dis-
tance threshold D, whereas the rebroadcast may be canceled
if the counter-based scheme is used.
Figure 11 illustrates the performance of the location-based
scheme at various threshold values of A. Note that the values
of A in the figure are chosen purposely to make a fair com-
parison with the distance-based and counter-based schemes
(recall the earlier discussion about how to choose the values
of D in figure 10). Clearly, as compared to the counter-based
and distance-based schemes, the location-based scheme has
the best reachability RE and the best saving SRB. Because
of the saving, the broadcast latency is also the best among all
schemes. The reason is that the location-based scheme uses
the most accurate information (i.e., locations of the transmit-
ting hosts) to determine the additional coverage of a rebroad-
cast.
Figure 12 shows the performance of the cluster-based
scheme where the location-based scheme is incorporated in its
step S2. Compared to the original location-based scheme, the
cluster-based scheme apparently saves much more rebroad-
casts and leads to shorter average broadcast latencies. Un-
fortunately, the reachability is unacceptable at sparser areas
(such as 7 × 7, 9 × 9, and 11 × 11 maps). This is prob-
ably because when the number of hosts participating in re-
broadcasting is reduced (mostly by its step S1), the collisions
caused by the hidden terminal problem will significantly re-

duce the chance of successful transmissions. For example,
figure 13 illustrates an interesting scenario where a broadcast
packet was propagated through gateway A to head B. After B
rebroadcasts the message, gateways C and D will try to re-
broadcast the message. Unfortunately, because C and D can
not hear each other, the two rebroadcasts from C and D are
very likely to collide at E. Such problems of message cor-
ruption may significantly reduce the reachability, especially
in sparser maps.
It is also worth mentioning that in figure 12(b) there is an
anomaly that the broadcast latencies in a 1×1 map are partic-
ularly low. This is because in our simulations there were on
average only 1.2 cluster heads. When there is only one head,
the broadcast will be completed very quickly because there is
no gateway.
4.2. The relationship between RE and SRB
In the previous section, we have shown the reachability
(RE) and the saved rebroadcasts (SRB) offered by different
schemes at different threshold values. Apparently, it is desir-
able to have high RE as well as high SRB. In this section, we
try to establish the relationship between these two metrics.
In addition, we also provide a comparison among different
schemes.
In figure 14, we show the RE and SRB offered by the
counter-based, distance-based, and location-based schemes at
different threshold values in various map sizes. These data are
redrawn from figures 9(a), 10(a), and 11(a) through x–y scat-
ter graphs. The x-axis indicates the RE and the y-axis indi-
cates the SRB. So the parts closer to the upper-right corners
of these graphs are more desirable.
Figure 14(a) shows that in a 1 × 1 map, both RE and SRB
approach toward the upper-right corner of the graph as a “less
strict” threshold value is used in each of these three schemes
(“less strict” in the sense that it is easier to satisfy the condi-
tion to prohibit a broadcast packet from being rebroadcast).
For instance, C = 2 is less strict than C = 3, D = 147 is
less strict than D = 72, and A = 0.187 is less strict than
A = 0.09. Since a 1 × 1 map indicates a more crowded sce-
nario, this actually justifies the severity of the broadcast storm
problem when mobile hosts are close to each other, and thus,
reducing the possibility of rebroadcasting is very important.
Overall, the location-based scheme with A = 0.187 is the
best choice.
Figure 14(b) shows the same simulation results in a
3 × 3 map. The least strict threshold values (C = 2, D = 147,
and A = 0.187) no longer offer the highest RE now. However,
the RE’s offered by all schemes at all threshold values are
all pretty satisfactory (all above 99%). So one could choose
a scheme that offers the best SRB. Overall, the counter-
based scheme with C = 2 and the location-based scheme with
A = 0.187 are better choices.
Figures 14(c)–(f) show the results in larger maps. Gen-
erally speaking, in all three schemes, the relationship be-
tween RE and SRB shows a tradeoff: a higher RE will lead
to a lower SRB, and vice versa. Thus, it really depends on
whether one would emphasize RE or SRB when choosing
an appropriate threshold value. As to the performance of
these three schemes, the location-based scheme is still the
best choice as its curve is closest to the upper-right corners
of these graphs.

Figure 15. The effect of load on RE and SRB in a 1×1: (a) probabilistic scheme, (b) counter-based scheme, (c) distance-based scheme, and (d) location-based
scheme.
To conclude this section, observe that in each graph in fig-
ure 14, there is a point “P1”, which indicates the RE and
SRB offered by the probabilistic scheme with P = 1 (i.e.,
the flooding scheme, so its SRB = 0). As can be seen, ex-
cept in a 5 × 5 map, it is always beneficial to adopt our pro-
posed schemes as one can always find a scheme which offers
a higher RE with a non-zero SRB.
4.3. The effect of load
In all previous simulations, we have used an arrival rate of
one broadcast request per second. We have also increased the
arrival rates to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 broadcast requests per
second to observe the effect. Four schemes, the probabilistic,
counter-based, distance-based, and location-based schemes,
were tested. The simulation results are shown in figures 15,
16, and 17 for maps of sizes 1×1, 5×5, and 9×9, respectively.
Note that the value appended at each scheme indicates the
threshold value used.
From these figures, we make three observations. First, we
see an interesting fact that a heavier load will result in a lower
reachability. This is true for all schemes, because a heav-
ier load actually means more contention and collision among
broadcast packets. The effect is more serious in denser maps
than in sparser maps. We believe that this can justify the
severity of the broadcast storm identified in this paper.
Second, to increase the reachability RE, a less strict thresh-
old value should be used in smaller maps, whereas a stricter
threshold value should be used in larger maps. Taking
the counter-based scheme as an example, in figure 15(b), a
threshold C = 2 will offer the highest RE in a 1 × 1 map.
When a larger 5 × 5 map is considered, figure 16(b) shows
that the counter-based scheme with C = 2 is no longer the
best when the load is below 20 broadcast requests per second.
However, it still has its advantage when the load is above 20.
Moving to a much larger 9 × 9 map, figure 17(b) shows that
C = 2 will offer the lowest RE. The same scenario can be
observed in other schemes too. This observation also implies
that a larger map can distribute the broadcast requests to larger
physical areas, and thus lower the severity of contention and
collision caused by rebroadcasting.
Third, we observe that for all schemes, the SRB will de-
crease as the load increases in a 1 × 1 map. This trend is

scheme.
very unfavorable because this means that there are more hosts
trying to help rebroadcast the broadcast packets, but the level
of RE keeps on going down as load increases. Fortunately,
in larger maps, such as 5 × 5 and 9 × 9, the SRB remains
almost unchanged as load increases. This again justifies that
the more crowded the area is, the more serious the broadcast
storm is.
5. Conclusions
This paper has identified an important issue in a MANET,
the broadcast storm problem. We have demonstrated, through
analyses and simulations, how serious this problem could
be. Several schemes, namely probabilistic, counter-based,
distance-based, location-based, and cluster-based schemes,
have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Simulation re-
sults based on different threshold values are presented to ver-
ify and compare the effectiveness of these schemes. As com-
pared to the basic flooding approach, a simple counter-based
scheme can eliminate many redundant rebroadcasts when
the host distribution is dense. The distance-based scheme
has higher reachability than the counter-based scheme, but
the amount of saving (in terms of the number of saved re-
broadcasts) is not satisfactory. Among all, the location-based
scheme is the best choice because it can eliminate most redun-
dant rebroadcasts under all kinds of host distributions without
compromising reachability.
