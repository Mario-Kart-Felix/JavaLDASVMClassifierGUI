Thank you for purchasing the Belkin ADSL Modem with Wireless 
802.11g Router (the Router). In minutes you will be able to share 
your Internet connection and network your computers with your new 
Router. The following is a list of features that make your Router an 
ideal solution for your home or small office network. Please be sure to 
read through this User Manual completely, and pay special attention to 
Appendix B entitled “Important Factors for Placement and Setup”.
Product Features
Compatibility with Both PCs and Mac® Computers
The Router supports a variety of networking environments including 
Mac OS® 8.x, 9.x, X v10.x, AppleTalk®, Linux®, Windows® 95, 98SE, 
Me, NT®, 2000, and XP, and others. You need an Internet browser  
and a network adapter that supports TCP/IP (the standard language 
of the Internet).
Front-Panel LED Display
Lighted LEDs on the front of the Router indicate which functions 
are in operation. You’ll know at-a-glance whether your Router is 
connected to the Internet. This feature eliminates the need for 
advanced software and status-monitoring procedures.
Web-Based Advanced User Interface
You can set up the Router’s advanced functions easily through your 
web browser, without having to install additional software onto the 
computer. There are no disks to install or keep track of and, best 
of all, you can make changes and perform setup functions from any 
computer on the network quickly and easily.
Integrated 10/100 4-Port Switch
The Router has a built-in, 4-port network switch to allow your wired 
computers to share printers, data and MP3 files, digital photos, 
and much more. The switch features automatic detection so it will 
adjust to the speed of connected devices. The switch will transfer 
data between computers and the Internet simultaneously without 
interrupting or consuming resources.
Integrated 802.11g Wireless Access Point
802.11g is an exciting new wireless technology that achieves data 
rates up to 54Mbps, nearly five times faster than 802.11b.
32
Introduction
Turbo Mode 
Belkin’s router supports Frame Bursting mode.
Selecting “Frame Bursting” will result in all devices capable of 
Frame Bursting to function in frame bursting mode, and all clients 
not capable to operate in normal 802.11g modes. Frame Bursting 
mode supports both Frame Bursting enabled devices and non Frame 
Bursting enabled devices simultaneously. Frame Bursting mode is 
based on the unreleased 802.11e specification. 
Built-In Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
Built-In Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on-board makes 
for the easiest possible connection of a network. The DHCP server 
will assign IP addresses to each computer automatically so there is no 
need for a complicated networking setup.
NAT IP Address Sharing
Your Router employs Network Address Translation (NAT) to share the 
single IP address assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider 
while saving the cost of adding additional IP addresses to your 
Internet service account.
SPI Firewall
Your Router is equipped with a firewall that will protect your network 
from a wide array of common hacker attacks including IP Spoofing, 
Land Attack, Ping of Death (PoD), Denial of Service (DoS), IP with zero 
length, Smurf Attack, TCP Null Scan, SYN flood, UDP flooding, Tear 
Drop Attack, ICMP defect, RIP defect, and fragment flooding.
MAC Address Filtering
For added security, you can set up a list of MAC addresses (unique client 
identifiers) that are allowed access to your network. Every computer has its 
own MAC address. Simply enter these MAC addresses into a list using the 
web-based user interface and you can control access to your network. 
Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) Compatibility
UPnP (Universal Plug-and-Play) is a technology that offers seamless 
operation of voice messaging, video messaging, games, and other 
applications that are UPnP-compliant.
Support for VPN Pass-Through
If you connect to your office network from home using a VPN 
connection, your Router will allow your VPN-equipped computer to 
pass through the Router and to your office network.

Connecting your Router
Positioning your Router
Your wireless connection will be stronger the closer your computer 
is to your Router. Typical indoor operating range for your wireless 
devices is between 100 and 200 feet. In the same way, your wireless 
connection and performance will degrade somewhat as the distance 
between your Router connected devices increases. This may or may 
not be noticeable to you. As you move further from your Router, 
connection speed may decrease. Factors that can weaken signals 
simply by getting in the way of your network’s radio waves are metal 
appliances, or obstructions, and walls. Please see “Appendix B: 
Important Factors for Placement and Setup” in this User Manual for 
more guidelines.
If you have concerns about your network’s performance that might be 
related to range or obstruction factors, try moving the computer to 
a position between five and 10 feet from the Router, in order to see 
if distance is the problem. If difficulties persist even at close range, 
please see the Troubleshooting section for solutions.

Connecting your Router
Connecting your ADSL Line 
Connection for the Router to the ADSL line varies by country and 
region. Typically it involves a microfilter or a microfilter with built-in 
splitter to allow simultaneous use of ADSL service and telephone 
service on the same telephone line. Please read the following steps 
carefully and select appropriate method.
1. If your telephone service and ADSL service are on the same 
telephone line, ADSL microfilters are needed for each telephone 
and device, such as answering machine, fax machine, and caller 
ID display. Additional splitters may be used to separate telephone 
lines for telephone and the Router.
Note: Do not connect the ADSL microfilter between the wall jack 
and the Router—this will prevent ADSL service from reaching  
the modem. 
2. If your telephone service and ADSL service are on the same 
telephone line and you are using an ADSL microfilter with built-in 
splitter, connect the splitter to the telephone wall jack providing 
ADSL service. Then, connect the telephone cord from the ADSL 
microfilter RJ11 port generally labeled “DSL” to the gray RJ11 
port labeled “DSL line” on the back of your Router. Connect 
telephony device to the other port on the ADSL splitter commonly 
labeled “Phone”. An additional ADSL microfilter is needed for 
another telephone and device on the same line.

1. IP Address
 The “IP address” is the internal IP address of the Router. 
The default IP address is “192.168.2.1”. To access the setup 
interface, type this IP address into the address bar of your 
browser. This address can be changed if needed. To change 
the IP address, type in the new IP address and click “Apply 
Changes”. The IP address you choose should be a non-routable 
IP. Examples of a non-routable IP are:
192.168.x.x (where x is anything between 0 and 255)
10.x.x.x (where x is anything between 0 and 255)
2. Subnet Mask
 There is no need to change the subnet mask. This is a unique, 
advanced feature of your Belkin Router.
3. DHCP Server
 The DHCP server function makes setting up a network very easy 
by assigning IP addresses to each computer on the network 
automatically. The default setting is “On”. The DHCP server can 
be turned OFF if necessary, however, in order to do so you must 
manually set a static IP address for each computer on your network. 
To turn off the DHCP server, select “Off” and click “Apply Changes”.
4. IP Pool
 The IP Pool is the range of IP addresses set aside for dynamic 
assignment to the computers on your network. The default is

2–100 (99 computers). If you want to change this number, you 
can do so by entering a new starting and ending IP address and 
clicking on “Apply Changes”. The DHCP server can assign 100 IP 
addresses automatically. This means that you cannot specify an 
IP address pool larger than 100 computers. For example, starting 
at 50 means you have to end at 150 or lower so as not to exceed 
the 100-client limit. The starting IP address must be lower in 
number than the ending IP address.
5. Lease Time
 Lease time is the length of time the DHCP server will reserve 
the IP address for each computer. We recommend that you 
leave the lease time set to “Forever”. The default setting is 
“Forever”, meaning that any time a computer is assigned an 
IP address by the DHCP server, the IP address will not change 
for that particular computer. Setting lease times for shorter 
intervals, such as one day or one hour, frees IP addresses after 
the specified period of time. This also means that a particular 
computer’s IP address may change over time. If you have set any 
of the other advanced features of the Router, such as DMZ or 
client IP filters, these are dependent on the IP address. For this 
reason, you will not want the IP address to change.
6. Local Domain Name
 The default setting is “Belkin”. You can set a local domain name 
(network name) for your network. There is no need to change this 
setting unless you have a specific advanced need to do so. You can 
name the network anything you want such as “MY NETWORK”.
3130
Manually Configuring your Router
DHCP Client List
You can view a list of the computers (known as clients), which are 
connected to your network. You are able to view the IP address (1) of 
the computer, the host name (2) (if the computer has been assigned 
one), and the MAC address (3) of the computer’s Network Interface 
Card (NIC). Pressing the “Refresh” (4) button will update the list. If 
there have been any changes, the list will be updated.
Internet WAN
The “Internet WAN” tab is where you will set up your Router to connect 
to your Internet Service Provider. The Router is capable of connecting 
to virtually any ADSL Service Provider’s system provided you have 
correctly configured the Router’s settings for your ISP’s connection type. 
Your connection settings are provided to you by your ISP. To configure 
the Router with the settings that your ISP gave you, click “Connection 
Type” (1) on the left side of the screen. Select the connection type you 
use. If your ISP gave you DNS settings, clicking “DNS” (2) allows you to 
enter DNS address entries for ISPs that require specific settings.
When you have finished making settings, the “Internet Status” indicator 
will read “Connection OK” if your Router is set up properly.

Setting your ISP Connection Type to PPPoE or PPPoA
PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is the standard 
method of connecting networked devices. It requires a user name and 
password to access the network of your ISP for connecting to the 
Internet. PPPoA (PPP over ATM) is similar to PPPoE, but is mostly 
implemented in the UK. Select PPPoE or PPPoA and click “Next”. 
Then enter the information provided by your ISP, and click “Apply 
Changes” to activate your settings.
1.  User Name - Enter the user name. (Assigned by your ISP).
2.  Password - Enter your password. (Assigned by your ISP).
3.  Retype Password - Confirm the password. (Assigned by your ISP).
4.   VPI/VCI - Enter your Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and Virtual Circuit 
Identifier (VCI) parameter here. (Assigned by your ISP).
5.   Encapsulation - Select your encapsulation type (supplied by your ISP) 
to specify how to handle multiple protocols at the ATM transport layer.
VC-MUX: PPPoA Virtual Circuit Multiplexer (null encapsulation) allows 
only one protocol running per virtual circuit with fewer overheads.
LLC: PPPoA Logical Link Control allows multiple protocols running over 
one virtual circuit (more overhead).
6.   Dial on Demand - By selecting “Dial on Demand” your Router will 
automatically connect to the Internet when a user opens up a web browser.
7.  Idle Time (Minutes) - Enter the maximum idle time for the Internet 
connection. After this time has been exceeded, the connection will  
be terminated.

DNS (Domain Name Server) Settings
A “Domain Name Server” is a server located on the Internet that 
translates Universal Resource Links (URLs) like “www.belkin.com” to 
IP addresses. Many ISPs do not require you to enter this information 
into the Router. The “Automatic from ISP” box (1) should be checked 
if your ISP did not give you a specific DNS address. If you are using 
a static IP connection type, then you may need to enter a specific 
DNS address and secondary DNS address for your connection to work 
properly. If your connection type is dynamic or PPPoE, it is likely that 
you do not have to enter a DNS address. Leave the “Automatic from 
ISP” box checked. To enter the DNS address settings, uncheck the 
“Automatic from ISP” box and enter your DNS entries in the spaces 
provided. Click “Apply Changes” (2) to save the settings.

Manually Configuring your Router
Wireless
The “Wireless” tab lets you make changes to the wireless network 
settings. From this tab, you can make changes to the wireless network 
name (SSID), operating channel, and encryption security settings.
Channel and SSID
1. Changing the Wireless Channel
There are a number of operating channels you can choose from. 
In the United States, there are 11 channels. In the United Kingdom 
and most of Europe, there are 13 channels. In a small number of 
other countries, there are other channel requirements. Your Router 
is configured to operate on the proper channels for the country you 
reside in. The default channel is 11 (unless you are in a country that 
does not allow channel 11). The channel can be changed if needed. If 
there are other wireless networks operating in your area, your network 
should be set to operate on a channel that is different than the other 
wireless networks. For best performance, use a channel that is at least 
five channels away from the other wireless networks. For instance, if 
another network is operating on channel 11, then set your network to 
channel 6 or below. To change the channel, select the channel from 
the drop-down list. Click “Apply Changes”. The change is immediate.
2. Changing the Wireless Network Name (SSID)
To identify your wireless network, a name called the SSID (Service 
Set Identifier) is used. The default SSID of the Router is “belkin54g”. 
You can change this to anything you want to or you can leave it 
unchanged. If there are other wireless networks operating in your 
area, you will want to make sure that your SSID is unique (does not 
match that of another wireless network in the area). To change the 
SSID, type in the SSID that you want to use in the SSID field (1) and 
click “Apply Changes” (2). The change is immediate. If you make

a change to the SSID, your wireless-equipped computers may also 
need to be reconfigured to connect to your new network name. Refer 
to the documentation of your wireless network adapter for information 
on making this change.
3. Using the ESSID Broadcast Feature
For security purposes, you can choose not to broadcast your 
network’s SSID. Doing so will keep your network name hidden from 
computers that are scanning for the presence of wireless networks. 
To turn off the broadcast of the SSID, select “DISABLE” and then 
click “Apply Changes”. The change is immediate. Each computer 
now needs to be set to connect to your specific SSID; an SSID of 
“ANY” will no longer be accepted. Refer to the documentation of your 
wireless network adapter for information on making this change.
Note: This advanced feature should be employed by advanced users only.
4. Using the Wireless Mode Switch
Your Router can operate in three different wireless modes:  
“802.11g-Auto”, “802.11g-Only”, and “802.11g-LRS”. The different 
modes are explained below.
• 802.11g-Auto - In this mode, the Router is compatible with 
802.11b and 802.11g wireless clients simultaneously. This is the 
factory default mode and ensures successful operation with all  
Wi-Fi-compatible devices. If you have a mix of 802.11b and 
802.11g clients in your network, we recommend setting the Router 
to 802.11g-Auto mode. This setting should only be changed if you 
have a specific reason to do so.
• 802.11g-Only Mode - 802.11g-Only mode works with 802.11g 
clients only. This mode is recommended only if you want to 
prevent 802.11b clients from accessing your network. To switch 
modes, select the desired mode from the “Wireless Mode”  
drop-down box. Then, click “Apply Changes”.
• 802.11g-LRS Mode - We recommend you DO NOT use this 
mode unless you have a very specific reason to do so. This mode 
exists only to solve unique problems that may occur with some 
802.11b client adapters and is NOT necessary for interoperability 
of 802.11g and 802.11b standards.
When to Use 802.11g-LRS Mode - In some cases, older 802.11b 
clients may not be compatible with 802.11g wireless technology. 
These adapters tend to be of inferior design and may use older 
drivers or technology. 802.11g-LRS (Limited Rate Support) allows 
3938
Manually Configuring your Router
these clients to be compatible with the newer 802.11g technology. 
Switching to this mode can solve problems that sometimes occur 
with these clients. If you suspect that you are using a client adapter 
that falls into this category, first check with the adapter vendor to 
see if there is a driver update. If there is no driver update available, 
switching to 802.11g-LRS mode may fix your problem. Please note 
that switching to 802.11g-LRS mode may decrease 802.11g 
performance slightly. 
5. Protected Mode Switch
As part of the 802.11g specification, Protected mode ensures proper 
operation of 802.11g clients and access points when there is heavy 
802.11b traffic in the operating environment. When Protected mode 
is ON, 802.11g scans for other wireless network traffic before it 
transmits data. Therefore, using this mode in environments with 
HEAVY 802.11b traffic or interference achieves best performance 
results. If you are in an environment with very little—or no—wireless 
network traffic, your best performance will be achieved with Protected 
mode OFF.
6. Using Frame Bursting
The Router supports Frame Bursting. 
Selecting “Frame Bursting Mode” will result in all devices capable of 
Frame Bursting to function in Frame Bursting mode, and all clients 
not capable, to operate in normal 802.11g modes. Frame Bursting 
mode supports both Frame Bursting-enabled devices and non-Frame 
Bursting-enabled devices simultaneously. Frame Bursting mode is 
based on the unreleased 802.11e specification.
Selecting “Off” will disable Turbo mode.

Securing your Wi-Fi Network
Here are a few different ways you can maximize the security of your 
wireless network and protect your data from prying eyes and ears. 
This section is intended for the home, home office, and small office 
user. At the time of this User Manual’s publication, there are three

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
WEP is a common protocol that adds security to all Wi-Fi-compliant 
wireless products. WEP was designed to give wireless networks the 
equivalent level of privacy protection as a comparable wired network. 
64-Bit WEP
64-bit WEP was first introduced with 64-bit encryption, which includes 
a key length of 40 bits plus 24 additional bits of system-generated 
data (64 bits total). Some hardware manufacturers refer to 64-bit 
as 40-bit encryption. Shortly after the technology was introduced, 
researchers found that 64-bit encryption was too easy to decode.
4140
Manually Configuring your Router
128-Bit WEP
As a result of 64-bit WEP’s potential security weaknesses, a more 
secure method of 128-bit encryption was developed. 128-bit 
encryption includes a key length of 104 bits plus 24 additional bits of 
system-generated data (128 bits total). Some hardware manufacturers 
refer to 128-bit as 104-bit encryption. 
Most of the new wireless equipment in the market today supports 
both 64-bit and 128-bit WEP encryption, but you might have older 
equipment that only supports 64-bit WEP. All Belkin wireless products 
will support both 64-bit and 128-bit WEP.
Encryption Keys
After selecting either the “64-bit” or “128-bit WEP” encryption mode, 
it is critical that you generate an encryption key. If the encryption key 
is not consistent throughout the entire wireless network, your wireless 
networking devices will be unable to communicate with one another 
on your network and you will not be able to successfully communicate 
within your network. 
You can enter your key by typing in the hex key manually, or you can 
type in a passphrase in the “Passphrase” field and click “Generate” 
to create a key. A hex (hexadecimal) key is a mixture of numbers and 
letters from A–F and 0–9. For 64-bit WEP, you need to enter 10 hex 
keys. For 128-bit WEP, you need to enter 26 hex keys. 
For instance:
AF 0F 4B C3 D4 = 64-bit WEP key
C3 03 0F AF 0F 4B B2 C3 D4 4B C3 D4 E7 = 128-bit WEP key
The WEP passphrase is NOT the same as a WEP key. Your wireless 
card uses this passphrase to generate your WEP keys, but different 
hardware manufacturers might have different methods for generating 
the keys. If you have equipment from multiple vendors in your 
network, you can use the hex WEP key from your Router or access 
point and enter it manually into the hex WEP key table in your 
wireless card’s configuration screen.

WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) 
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is a new Wi-Fi standard that was 
designed to improve upon the security features of WEP. To use WPA 
security, the drivers and software of your wireless equipment must 
be upgraded to support WPA. These updates will be found on the 
wireless vendors’ websites. There are two types of WPA security: 
WPA-PSK (no server) and WPA (with radius server).
WPA-PSK (no server)
This method uses what is known as a Pre-Shared key as the Network 
key. A Network key is basically a password that is between eight 
and 63 characters long. It can be a combination of letters, numbers, 
or characters. Each client uses the same Network key to access the 
network. Typically, this is the mode that will be used in a  
home environment. 
WPA (with radius server)
With this system, a radius server distributes the Network key to 
the clients automatically. This is typically found in a business 
environment. For a list of Belkin wireless products that support WPA, 
please visit our website at www.belkin.com/networking.

Manually Configuring your Router
Sharing the Same Network Keys
Most Wi-Fi products ship with security turned off. So once you have 
your network working, you need to activate WEP or WPA and make 
sure your wireless networking devices are sharing the same  
Network key. 
The Wireless G Desktop Network Card cannot access the network 
because it is using a different Network key than the Network key that 
is configured on the Wireless G Router.

Using a Hexadecimal Key
A hexadecimal key is a mixture of numbers and letters from A–F and 
0–9. 64-bit keys are five two-digit numbers. 128-bit keys are 13  
two-digit numbers.
For instance:
AF 0F 4B C3 D4 = 64-bit key
C3 03 0F AF 0F 4B B2 C3 D4 4B C3 D4 E7 = 128-bit key
In the boxes below, make up your key by writing in two characters 
between A–F and 0–9 in each box. You will use this key to program 
the encryption settings on your Router and your wireless computers.
Note to Mac users: Original Apple AirPort® products support  
64-bit encryption only. Apple AirPort 2 products can support 64-bit or 
128-bit encryption. Please check your product to see which version 
you are using. If you cannot configure your network with 128-bit 
encryption, try 64-bit encryption.

64-Bit WEP Encryption
1. Select “64-bit WEP” from the drop-down menu.
2.  After selecting your WEP encryption mode, you can enter your key 
by typing in the hex key manually. 
A hex (hexadecimal) key is a mixture of numbers and letters from A–F 
and 0–9. For 64-bit WEP, you need to enter 10 hex keys. 
For instance:
AF 0F 4B C3 D4 = 64-bit WEP key
3.  Click “Apply Changes” to finish. Encryption in the Router is now 
set. Each of your computers on your wireless network will now 
need to be configured with the same security settings.

Manually Configuring your Router
Changing the Wireless Security Settings
Your Router is equipped with WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access), the 
latest wireless security standard. It also supports the legacy security 
standard, WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). By default, wireless 
security is disabled. To enable security, you must first determine 
which standard you want to use. To access the security settings, click 
“Security” on the Wireless tab.
WPA Setup
Note: To use WPA security, all your clients must be upgraded 
to drivers and software that support it. At the time of this User 
Manual’s publication, a security patch download is available free 
from Microsoft. This patch works only with the Windows XP operating 
system. You also need to download the latest driver for your Belkin 
Wireless G Desktop or Notebook Network Card from the Belkin 
support site. Other operating systems are not supported at this time. 
Microsoft’s patch only supports devices with WPA-enabled drivers 
such as Belkin 802.11g products.
There are two types of WPA security: WPA-PSK (no server) and WPA 
(with radius server). WPA-PSK (no server) uses a so-called  
Pre-Shared key as the security key. A Pre-Shared key is a password 
that is between eight and 63 characters long. It can be a combination 
of letters, numbers, and other characters. Each client uses the same  
key to access the network. Typically, this mode will be used in a  
home environment.
WPA (with radius server) is a configuration wherein a radius server 
distributes the keys to the clients automatically. This is typically used 
in a business environment.

Manually Configuring your Router
Firewall
Your Router is equipped with a firewall that will protect your network 
from a wide array of common hacker attacks including:
•  IP Spoofing
•  Land Attack
•  Ping of Death (PoD)
•  Denial of Service (DoS)
•  IP with zero length
•  Smurf Attack
•  TCP Null Scan
•  SYN flood
•  UDP flooding
•  Tear Drop Attack
•  ICMP defect
•  RIP defect
•  Fragment flooding
The firewall also masks common ports that are frequently used to 
attack networks. These ports appear to be “Stealth”, meaning that 
essentially they do not exist to a would-be hacker. You can turn the 
firewall function off if needed; however, it is recommended that you 
leave the firewall enabled. Disabling the firewall protection will not 
leave your network completely vulnerable to hacker attacks, but it is 
recommended that you leave the firewall enabled.

Virtual Servers
Virtual servers allow you to route external (Internet) calls for services such 
as a web server (port 80), FTP server (Port 21), or other applications, 
through your Router to your internal network. Since your internal 
computers are protected by a firewall, machines from the Internet cannot 
get to them because they cannot be “seen”. If you need to configure the 
virtual server function for a specific application, you will need to contact 
the application vendor to find out which port settings you need. You can 
manually input this port information into the Router.
Choosing an Application
A list of popular applications has been included to choose from. Click 
on “Select a Service” then select your application from the drop-down 
list. The settings will be transferred to the first row available. Click 
“Add” to save the setting for that application.
Manually Entering Settings into the Virtual Server
To manually enter settings, click on “Custom Server” and enter a 
name for the server. Enter the Server IP address in the space provided 
for the internal machine and the port(s) required to pass. Then select 
the protocol type (TCP or UDP), and then click “Add”.
Opening ports in your firewall can pose a security risk. You can enable 
and disable settings very quickly. It is recommended that you disable 
the settings when you are not using a specific application.
5756
Manually Configuring your Router
Client IP Filters
The Router can be configured to restrict access to the Internet, email, or 
other network services at specific days and times. Restriction can be set 
for a single computer, a range of computers, or multiple computers.
To restrict Internet access to a single computer for example, enter 
a name of the filter in “Filter Name” box (1) and IP address of the 
computer you wish to restrict access to in the IP field (2). Next, enter 
“80:80” in the Port field (3). Select protocol from the “Protocol”  
drop-down box (4). Click “Apply Changes”. The computer at the IP 
address you specified will now be blocked from Internet access. 
MAC Address Filtering
The MAC address filter is a powerful security feature that allows you 
to specify which computers are allowed on the network. Any computer 
attempting to access the network that is not specified in the filter list 
will be denied access. When you enable this feature, you must enter a 
name for the user and the MAC address of each client on your network 
to allow network access. Next, click “Add” to save the settings.

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
If you have a client PC that cannot run an Internet application 
properly from behind the firewall, you can open the client up to 
unrestricted two-way Internet access. This may be necessary if the 
NAT feature is causing problems with an application such as a game 
or video conferencing application. Use this feature on a temporary 
basis. The computer in the DMZ is not protected from  
hacker attacks.
To put a computer in the DMZ, enter its LAN IP address in the “Private 
IP” field and click “Apply Changes” for the change to take effect.
Blocking an ICMP Ping
Computer hackers use what is known as “pinging” to find potential 
victims on the Internet. By pinging a specific IP address and 
receiving a response from the IP address, a hacker can determine 
that something of interest might be there. The Router can be set 
up so it will not respond to an ICMP ping from the outside. This 
heightens the level of security of your Router. 
To turn off the ping response, select “Block ICMP Ping” (1) and click 
“Apply Changes”. The Router will not respong to an ICMP Ping.

System Settings
The “System Settings” page is where you can enter a new 
administrator password, set the time zone, enable remote 
management, and turn on and off the UPnP function of the Router.
Setting or Changing the Administrator Password
The Router ships with NO password entered. If you wish to add a 
password for greater security, you can set a password here. Write 
down your password and keep it in a safe place, as you will need it if 
you need to log into the Router in the future. It is also recommended 
that you set a password if you plan to use the remote management 
feature of your Router.
Changing the Login Time-Out Setting
The login time-out option allows you to set the period of time that 
you can be logged into the Router’s advanced setup interface. The 
timer starts when there has been no activity. For example, you have 
made some changes in the advanced setup interface, then left your 
computer alone without clicking “Logout”. Assuming the time-out is 
set to 10 minutes, then 10 minutes after you leave, the login session 
will expire. You will have to log into the Router again to make any 
more changes. The login time-out option is for security purposes and 
the default is set to 10 minutes.
Note: Only one computer can be logged into the Router’s advanced 
setup interface at one time.
6564
Manually Configuring your Router
Setting the Time and Time Zone
The Router keeps time by connecting to a Simple Network Time 
Protocol (SNTP) server. This allows the Router to synchronize the 
system clock to the global Internet. The synchronized clock in the 
Router is used to record the security log and control client filtering. 
Select desired NTP time servers and the time zone that you reside 
in, then click “Apply Changes”. The system clock may not update 
immediately. Allow at least 15 minutes for the Router to contact the 
time servers on the Internet and get a response. You cannot set the 
clock yourself.
Enabling Remote Management
Before you enable this advanced feature of your Belkin Router, MAKE 
SURE YOU HAVE SET THE ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD. Remote 
management allows you to make changes to your Router’s settings 
from anywhere on the Internet. 
Click on the “Change Settings” button to bring up the “Remote 
Management” page.
There are two methods of remotely managing the Router. The first 
is to allow access to the Router from anywhere on the Internet by 
selecting “Any IP address can remotely manage the Router”. By 
typing in your WAN IP address from any computer on the Internet, 
you will be presented with a login screen where you need to type in 
the password of your Router. 
The second method is to allow a specific IP address only to remotely 
manage the Router. This is more secure, but less convenient. To use 
this method, enter the IP address you know you will be accessing the 
Router from in the space provided and select “Only this IP address 
can remotely manage the Router”. Before you enable this function, 
it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you set your administrator 
password. Leaving the password empty will potentially open your 
Router to intrusion.

Enabling/Disabling UPnP
UPnP (Universal Plug-and-Play) is yet another advanced feature 
offered by your Belkin Router. It is a technology that offers seamless 
operation of voice messaging, video messaging, games, and other 
applications that are UPnP-compliant. Some applications require 
the Router’s firewall to be configured in a specific way to operate 
properly. This usually requires opening TCP and UDP ports, and in 
some instances, setting trigger ports. An application that is UPnP-
compliant has the ability to communicate with the Router, basically 
“telling” the Router which way it needs the firewall configured. The 
Router ships with the UPnP feature disabled. If you are using any 
applications that are UPnP-compliant, and wish to take advantage of 
the UPnP features, you can enable the UPnP feature. 
Click on the “Change Setting” button to bring up the “UPnP Setting” 
page. Then select “On” for “Enable UPnP”. Click on the “Apply 
Changes” button to save your settings.

If you are unable to connect to the Internet from a wireless computer, 
please check the following items:
1. Look at the lights on your Router. If you are using a Belkin Router, 
the lights should be as follows:
 • The “Power” light should be on.
 • The “Connected” light should be on, and not blinking.
 • The “WAN” light should be either on or blinking.
2. Open your wireless utility software by clicking on the icon in 
the system tray at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. 
If you’re using a Belkin Wireless Card, the tray icon should look 
like this.  The icon may be red or green.
3. The exact window that opens will vary depending on the model of 
wireless card you have; however, any of the utilities should have 
a list of “Available Networks”— those wireless networks it can 
connect to.

the results?
Yes, my network name is listed—go to the troubleshooting 
solution titled “I can’t connect to the Internet wirelessly, but my 
network name is listed”.
No, my network name is not listed—go to the troubleshooting 
solution titled “I can’t connect to the Internet wirelessly, and my 
network name is not listed”.
Problem:
I can’t connect to the Internet wirelessly, but my network name  
is listed.
Solution:
If the name of your network is listed in the “Available Networks” list, 
please follow the steps below to connect wirelessly:
1. Click on the correct network name in the “Available  
Networks” list.  
2.  If the network has security (encryption) enabled, you will need to 
enter the network key. For more information regarding security, 
see the page entitled: “Changing the Wireless Security Settings”.
3.  Within a few seconds, the tray icon in the lower left-hand 
corner of your screen should turn green, indication a successful 
connection to the network.  
Problem:
I can’t connect to the Internet wirelessly, and my network name is 
not listed.
Solution
If the correct network name is not listed under “Available  
Networks” in the wireless utility, please attempt the following 
troubleshooting steps:
1. Temporarily move computer, if possible, five to 10 feet from 
the Router. Close the wireless utility, and re-open it. If the

correct network name now appears under “Available Networks”, 
you may have a range or interference problem. Please see the 
suggestions discussed in Appendix B entitled “Important Factors 
for Placement and Setup”.
2. Using a computer that is connected to the Router via a network 
cable (as opposed to wirelessly), ensure that “Broadcast SSID” is 
enabled. This setting is found on the Router’s wireless “Channel 
and SSID” configuration page.
 If you are still unable to access the Internet after completing 
these steps, please contact Belkin Technical Support.
Problem: 
My wireless network performance is inconsistent.
Data transfer is sometimes slow.
Signal strength is poor.
Difficulty establishing and/or maintaining a Virtual Private Network 
(VPN) connection.
Solution:
Wireless technology is radio-based, which means connectivity and 
the throughput performance between devices decreases when 
the distance between devices increases. Other factors that will 
cause signal degradation (metal is generally the worst culprit) are 
obstructions such as walls and metal appliances. As a result, the 
typical indoor range of your wireless devices will be between 100 
to 200 feet. Note also that connection speed may decrease as you 
move further from the Router or access point. 
In order to determine if wireless issues are related to range, we 
suggest temporarily moving the computer, if possible, five to 10 feet 
from the Router. 
Changing the wireless channel - Depending on local wireless 
traffic and interference, switching the wireless channel of your 
network can improve performance and reliability. The default 
channel the Router is shipped with is channel 11, you may choose 
from several other channels depending on your region; see the 
section entitled “Changing the Wireless Channel” on page 37 for 
instructions on how to choose other channels. 
7170
Troubleshooting
Limiting the wireless transmit rate - Limiting the wireless transmit 
rate can help improve the maximum wireless range, and connection 
stability. Most wireless cards have the ability to limit the transmission 
rate. To change this property, go to the Windows Control Panel, 
open “Network Connections” and double-click on your wireless 
card’s connection. In the “Properties” dialog, select the “Configure” 
button on the “General” tab (Windows 98 users will have to select the 
wireless card in the list box and then click “Properties”), then choose 
the “Advanced” tab and select the rate property. Wireless client cards 
are usually set to automatically adjust the wireless transmit rate for 
you, but doing so can cause periodic disconnects when the wireless 
signal is too weak; as a rule, slower transmission rates are more 
stable. Experiment with different connection rates until you find the 
best one for your environment; note that all available transmission 
rates should be acceptable for browsing the Internet. For more 
assistance, see your wireless card’s user manual.
Problem:
I am having difficulty setting up Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
security on a Belkin Router or Belkin Access Point.
Solution 
1.  Log into your Wireless Router or access point. 
2.  Open your web browser and type in IP address of the Wireless

network will now need to be configured with the same  
security settings. 
WARNING:  If you are configuring the Wireless Router or Access 
Point from a computer with a wireless client, you will need to ensure 
that security is turned on for this wireless client. If this is not done, 
you will lose your wireless connection.
Note to Mac users: Original Apple AirPort® products support  
64-bit encryption only. Apple AirPort 2 products can support  
64-bit or 128-bit encryption. Please check your Apple AirPort 
product to see which version you are using. If you cannot configure 
your network with 128-bit encryption, try 64-bit encryption.
Problem:
I am having difficulty setting up Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)    
security on a Belkin Wireless Card.
Solution:
The Wireless Card must use the same key as the Wireless Router or 
access point. For instance, if your Wireless Router or access point 
uses the key 00112233445566778899AABBCC, then the Wireless 
Card must be set to the exact same key.

What’s the difference between 802.11b, 802.11g, 
802.11a, and Pre-N? 
Currently there are four levels of wireless networking standards, which 
transmit data at very different maximum speeds. Each is based on 
the designation 802.11(x), so named by the IEEE, the board that is 
responsible for certifying networking standards. The most common 
wireless networking standard, 802.11b, transmits information at 11Mbps; 
802.11a and 802.11g work at 54Mbps; and Pre-N works at 108Mbps. 
Pre-N, the precursor to the upcoming 802.11n release, promises speeds 
that exceed 802.11g, and up to twice the wireless coverage area. See 
the following chart for more detailed information.

Appendix A: Glossary
IP Address
The “IP address” is the internal IP address of the Router. To access 
the advanced setup interface, type this IP address into the address 
bar of your browser. This address can be changed if needed. To 
change the IP address, type in the new IP address and click “Apply 
Changes”. The IP address you choose should be a non-routable IP. 
Examples of a non-routable IP are:
192.168.x.x (where x is anything between 0 and 255)
10.x.x.x (where x is anything between 0 and 255)
Subnet Mask
Some networks are far too large to allow all traffic to flood all its parts. 
These networks must be broken down into smaller, more manageable 
sections, called subnets. The subnet mask is the network address plus 
the information reserved for identifying the “subnetwork”.
DNS
DNS is an acronym for Domain Name Server. A Domain Name Server 
is a server located on the Internet that translates URLs (Universal 
Resource Links) like www.belkin.com to IP addresses. Many ISPs 
do not require you to enter this information into the Router. If you 
are using a static IP connection type, then you may need to enter 
a specific DNS address and secondary DNS address for your 
connection to work properly. If your connection type is Dynamic or 
PPPoE, it is likely that you do not have to enter a DNS address.
PPPoE
Most ADSL providers use PPPoE as the connection type. If you use 
an ADSL modem to connect to the Internet, your ISP may use PPPoE 
to log you into the service.
Your connection type is PPPoE if:
1. Your ISP gave you a user name and password which is required 
to connect to the Internet.
2. Your ISP gave you software such as WinPoET or Enternet300 that 
you use to connect to the Internet.
8180
Appendixes
3. You have to double-click on a desktop icon other than your 
browser to get on the Internet. 
 To set the Router to use PPPoE, type in your user name and 
password in the spaces provided. After you have typed in your 
information, click “Apply Changes”.
After you apply the changes, the “Internet Status” indicator will read 
“connection OK” if your Router is set up properly.
PPPoA
Enter the PPPoA information in the provided spaces, and click “Next”. 
Click “Apply” to activate your settings.
1. User name - Enter the user name. (Assigned by your ISP).
2. Password - Enter your password. (Assigned by your ISP).
3. Retype Password - Confirm the password. (Assigned by your ISP).
4. VPI/VCI - Enter your Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and Virtual Circuit 
Identifier (VCI) parameter here. (Assigned by your ISP).
Disconnect after X...
This feature is used to automatically disconnect the Router from 
your ISP when there is no activity for a specified period of time. For 
instance, placing a check mark next to this option and entering “5” 
into the minute field will cause the Router to disconnect from the 
Internet after five minutes of no Internet activity. This option should 
be used if you pay for your Internet service by the minute.
Channel and SSID
To change the channel of operation of the Router, select the desired 
channel from the drop-down menu and select your channel. Click 
“Apply Changes” to save the setting. You can also change the SSID. 
The SSID is the equivalent to the wireless network’s name. You can 
make the SSID anything you want to. If there are other wireless 
networks in your area, you should give your wireless network a unique 
name. Click inside of the SSID box and type in a new name. Click 
“Apply Changes” to make the change.

ESSID Broadcast
Many wireless network adapters currently on the market possess 
a feature known as site survey. It scans the air for any available 
network and allows each computer to automatically select a network 
from the survey. This occurs if the computer’s SSID is set to “ANY”. 
Your Belkin Router can block this random search for a network. If 
you disable the “ESSID Broadcast” feature, the only way a computer 
can join your network is by its SSID being set to the specific name of 
the network (like WLAN). Be sure that you know your SSID (network 
name) before enabling this feature. It is possible to make your 
wireless network nearly invisible. By turning off the broadcast of the 
SSID, your network will not appear in a site survey. Obviously, turning 
off the broadcast feature of the SSID helps increase security.
Encryption
Setting encryption can help keep your network secure. The Router 
uses Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption to protect your data 
and features two rates of encryption: 64-bit and 128-bit. Encryption 
works on a system of keys. The key on the computer must match the 
key on the Router, and there are two ways to make a key. The easiest 
is to let the Router’s software convert a passphrase you’ve created 
into a key. The advanced method is to enter the keys manually.
Virtual Servers
This function will allow you to route external (Internet) calls for 
services such as a web server (port 80), FTP server (Port 21), or other 
applications through your Router to your internal network. Since your 
internal computers are protected by a firewall, machines from the 
Internet cannot get to them because they cannot be “seen”. If you 
need to configure the virtual server function for a specific application, 
you will need to contact the application vendor to find out which port 
settings you need. 
To manually enter settings, enter the IP address in the space provided 
for the internal machine, the port type (TCP or UDP), and the LAN 
and public port(s) required to pass. Then select “Enable” and click 
“Set”. You can only pass one port per internal IP address. Opening 
ports in your firewall can pose a security risk. You can enable and 
disable settings very quickly. It is recommended that you disable the 
settings when you are not using a specific application.
8382
Appendixes
Client IP Filters
The Router can be configured to restrict access to the Internet, 
email, or other network services at specific days and times. 
Restriction can be set for a single computer, a range of computers, 
or multiple computers.
URL Blocking
To configure the URL blocking feature, specify the websites (www.
somesite.com) and/or keywords you want to filter on your network. 
Click “Apply Changes” to activate the change. To complete this 
configuration, you will need to create or modify an access rule in the 
client IP filters section. To modify an existing rule, click the “Edit” 
option next to the rule you want to modify. To create a new rule, click 
on the “Add PC” option. From the “Access Control Add PC” section, 
check the option for “WWW with URL Blocking” in the “Client PC 
Service” table to filter out the websites and keywords specified.
Schedule Rule
To configure the schedule rule, specify the name, comment, start 
time, and end time that you want to filter on your network. This page 
defines schedule rule names and activates the schedule for use in 
the “Access Control” page.
MAC Address Filtering
The MAC address filter is a powerful security feature that allows 
you to specify which computers are allowed on the network. Any 
computer attempting to access the network that is not specified in 
the filter list will be denied access. When you enable this feature, you 
must enter the MAC address of each client on your network to allow

NAT feature is causing problems with an application such as a game 
or video conferencing application. Use this feature on a temporary 
basis. The computer in the DMZ is not protected from hacker 
attacks. To put a computer in the DMZ, enter the last digits of its 
LAN IP address in the “Static IP” field and click “Apply Changes” for 
the change to take effect.
If you have only one public (WAN) IP address, then you can leave 
the public IP to “0.0.0.0”. If you are using multiple public (WAN) IP 
addresses, it is possible to select which public (WAN) IP address the 
DMZ host will be directed to. Type in the public (WAN) IP address 
you wish the DMZ host to direct to, enter the last two digits of the IP 
address of the DMZ host computer, and click “Apply Changes”.
Administrator Password
The Router ships with NO password entered. If you wish to add 
a password for more security, you can set a password from your 
Router’s web-based user interface. Keep your password in a safe 
place as you will need this password if you need to log into the 
Router in the future. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you set 
a password if you plan to use the remote management feature. The 
login time-out option allows you to set the period of time that you can 
be logged into the Router’s advanced setup interface. The timer starts 
when there has been no activity. For example, you have made some 
changes in the advanced setup interface, then left your computer 
alone without clicking “Logout”.
Assuming the time-out is set to 10 minutes, then 10 minutes after 
you leave, the login session will expire. You will have to log into the 
Router again to make any more changes. The login time-out option 
is for security purposes and the default is set to 10 minutes. Note, 
only one computer can be logged into the Router’s advanced setup 
interface at a time.
Time and Time Zone
The Router keeps time by connecting to a Simple Network Time 
Protocol (SNTP) server. This allows the Router to synchronize the 
system clock to the global Internet. The synchronized clock in the 
Router is used to record the security log and control client filtering. 
Select the time zone that you reside in. If you reside in an area that 
observes daylight saving time, then place a check mark in the box 
next to “Enable Daylight Saving”. The system clock may not update 
8584
Appendixes
immediately. Allow at least 15 minutes for the Router to contact the 
time servers on the Internet and get a response. You cannot set the 
clock yourself.
Remote Management
Before you enable this function, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SET THE 
ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD. Remote management allows you to 
make changes to your Router’s settings from anywhere on  
the Internet.
UPnP
UPnP (Universal Plug-and-Play) is a technology that offers seamless 
operation of voice messaging, video messaging, games, and other 
applications that are UPnP-compliant. Some applications require 
the Router’s firewall to be configured in a specific way to operate 
properly. This usually requires opening TCP and UDP ports and in 
some instances setting trigger ports. An application that is  
UPnP-compliant has the ability to communicate with the Router, 
basically “telling” the Router which way it needs the firewall 
configured. The Router ships with the UPnP feature disabled. If 
you are using any applications that are UPnP-compliant, and wish 
to take advantage of the UPnP features, you can enable the UPnP 
feature. Simply select “Enable” in the “UPnP Enabling” section of the 
“Utilities” page. Click “Apply Changes” to save the change.

Appendix B: Important Factors for Placement and Setup
Note: While some of the items listed below can affect network 
performance, they will not prohibit your wireless network from 
functioning; if you are concerned that your network is not operating 
at its maximum effectiveness, this checklist may help.
1. Wireless Router (or Access Point) Placement 
 Place your Wireless Router (or access point), the central 
connection point of your network, as close as possible to the 
center of your wireless network devices. 
 To achieve the best wireless network coverage for your “wireless 
clients” (i.e., computers enabled by Belkin Wireless Notebook 
Network Cards, Wireless Desktop Network Cards, and Wireless 
USB Adapters): 
• Ensure that your Wireless Router’s (or access point’s) 
networking antennas are parallel to each other, and are 
positioned vertically (toward the ceiling). If your Wireless 
Router (or access point) itself is positioned vertically, point the 
antennas a much as possible in an upward direction. 
• In multistory homes, place the Wireless Router (or access 
point) on a floor that is as close to the center of the home 
as possible. This may mean placing the Wireless Router (or 
access point) on an upper floor.
• Try not to place the Wireless Router (or access point) near a 
cordless 2.4GHz phone.
2.  Avoid Obstacles and Interference 
 Avoid placing your Wireless Router (or access point) near devices 
that may emit radio “noise,” such as microwave ovens. Dense 
objects that can inhibit wireless communication include: 
• Refrigerators
• Washers and/or dryers
• Metal cabinets
• Large aquariums
• Metallic-based UV tinted windows 
8786
Appendixes
 If your wireless signal seems weak in some spots, make sure that 
objects such as these are not blocking the signal’s path (between 
your computers and Wireless Router or access point).
3.  Cordless Phones
 If the performance of your wireless network is impaired after 
attending to the above issues, and you have a cordless phone: 
• Try moving cordless phones away from Wireless Routers (or 
access points) and your wireless-enabled computers. 
• Unplug and remove the battery from any cordless phone 
that operates on the 2.4GHz band (check manufacturer’s 
information). If this fixes the problem, your phone may  
be interfering. 
• If your phone supports channel selection, change the channel 
on the phone to the farthest channel from your wireless 
network. For example, change the phone to channel 1 and 
move your Wireless Router (or access point) to channel 11. 
See your phone’s user manual for detailed instructions. 
• If necessary, consider switching to a 900MHz or 5GHz 
cordless phone.
4.  Choose the “Quietest” Channel for your Wireless Network 
 In locations where homes or offices are close together, such as 
apartment buildings or office complexes, there may be wireless 
networks nearby that can conflict with yours. 
 Use the Site Survey capabilities found in the Wireless LAN Utility 
of your wireless adapter to locate any other wireless networks 
that are available (see your wireless adapter’s manual), and 
move your Wireless Router (or access point) and computers to a 
channel as far away from other networks as possible.
 Experiment with more than one of the available channels, in 
order to find the clearest connection and avoid interference from 
neighboring cordless phones or other wireless devices. 
 For Belkin wireless networking products, use the detailed Site 
Survey and wireless channel information included in your  
User Manual.

  These guidelines should allow you to cover the maximum 
possible area with your Wireless Router (or access point). Should 
you need to cover an even wider area, we suggest the Belkin 
Wireless Range Extender/Access Point.
5. Secure Connections, VPNs, and AOL 
 Secure connections typically require a user name and password, and 
are used where security is important. Secure connections include:
•  Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections, often used to 
connect remotely to an office network
•  The “Bring Your Own Access” program from America Online 
(AOL), which lets you use AOL through broadband provided by 
another cable or DSL service
•  Most online banking websites
•  Many commercial websites that require a user name and 
password to access your account 
 Secure connections can be interrupted by a computer’s power 
management setting, which causes it to “go to sleep.” The 
simplest solution to avoid this is to simply reconnect by rerunning 
the VPN or AOL software, or by re-logging into the secure website.
 A second alternative is to change your computer’s power 
management settings so it does not go to sleep; however, this 
may not be appropriate for portable computers. To change your 
power management setting under Windows, see the “Power 
Options” item in the Control Panel.
 If you continue to have difficulty with Secure Connections, VPNs, 
and AOL, please review the steps in the previous pages to be 
sure you have addressed these issues.
Appendix C: Internet Connection Setting Table
The table on the next page provides references to select and configure 
Internet connection in setting up your ADSL connection. Many ISPs 
use different settings depending on the region and equipment they use. 
You may try the setting for the ISPs in your region. If it does not work, 
please contact your ISP for your specific setting.
