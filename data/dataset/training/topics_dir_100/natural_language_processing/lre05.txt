Abstract. This paper describes a corpus annotation project to study issues in
the manual annotation of opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations
and other private states in language. The resulting corpus annotation scheme is
described, as well as examples of its use. In addition, the manual annotation process
and the results of an inter-annotator agreement study on a 10,000-sentence corpus
of articles drawn from the world press are presented.
Keywords: affect, attitudes, corpus annotation, emotion, natural language process-
ing, opinions, sentiment, subjectivity
1. Introduction
There has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification
and extraction of opinions, emotions, and sentiments in text. Motiva-
tion for this task comes from the desire to provide tools for information
analysts in government, commercial, and political domains, who want
to automatically track attitudes and feelings in the news and on-line
forums. How do people feel about recent events in the Middle East? Is
the rhetoric from a particular opposition group intensifying? What is
the range of opinions being expressed in the world press about the best
course of action in Iraq? A system that could automatically identify
opinions and emotions from text would be an enormous help to someone
trying to answer these kinds of questions.
Researchers from many subareas of Artificial Intelligence and Nat-
ural Language Processing have been working on the automatic iden-
tification of opinions and related tasks (e.g., Pang et al. (2002), Dave
et al. (2003), Gordon et al. (2003), Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Riloff et
al. (2003), Turney and Littman (2003), Yi et al. (2003), and Yu and
Hatzivassiloglou (2003)). To date, most such work has focused on sen-
timent or subjectivity classification at the document or sentence level.
Document classification tasks include, for example, distinguishing edi-

torials from news articles and classifying reviews as positive or negative
(Wiebe et al., 2001b; Pang et al., 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).
A common sentence-level task is to classify sentences as subjective or
objective (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003).
However, for many applications, identifying only opinionated doc-
uments or sentences may not be sufficient. In the news, it is not un-
common to find two or more opinions in a single sentence, or to find a
sentence containing opinions as well as factual information. Information
extraction (IE) systems are natural language processing (NLP) systems
that extract from text any information relevant to a pre-specified topic.
An IE system trying to distinguish between factual information (which
should be extracted) and non-factual information (which should be dis-
carded or labeled uncertain) would benefit from the ability to pinpoint
the particular clauses that contain opinions. This ability would also be
important for multi-perspective question answering systems, which aim
to present multiple answers to non-factual questions based on opinions
derived from different sources; and for multi-document summarization
systems, which need to summarize different opinions and perspectives.
Many applications would benefit from being able to determine not
just whether a document or text snippet is opinionated but also the
intensity of the opinion. Flame detection systems, for example, want
to identify strong rants and emotional tirades, while letting milder
opinions pass through (Spertus, 1997; Kaufer, 2000). In addition, in-
formation analysts need to recognize changes over time in the degree of
virulence expressed by persons or groups of interest, and to detect when
their rhetoric is heating up or cooling down (Tong, 2001). Furthermore,
knowing the types of attitude being expressed (e.g., positive versus neg-
ative evaluations) would enable a natural language processing (NLP)
application to target particular types of opinions.
Very generally then, we assume that the existence of corpora anno-
tated with rich information about opinions and emotions would support
the development and evaluation of NLP systems that exploit such infor-
mation. In particular, statistical and machine learning approaches have
become the method of choice for constructing a wide variety of practical
NLP applications. These methods, however, typically require training
and test corpora that have been manually annotated with respect to
each language-processing task to be acquired.
The high-level goal of this paper, therefore, is to investigate the
use of opinion and emotion in language through a corpus annotation
study. In particular, we propose a detailed annotation scheme that
identifies key components and properties of opinions, emotions, senti-
ments, speculations, evaluations, and other private states (Quirk et al.,
1985), i.e., internal states that cannot be directly observed by others.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.2
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 3
We argue, through the presentation of numerous examples, that this
annotation scheme covers a broad and useful subset of the range of
linguistic expressions and phenomena employed in naturally occurring
text to express opinion and emotion.
We propose a relatively fine-grained annotation scheme, annotat-
ing text at the word- and phrase-level rather than at the level of
the document or sentence. For every expression of a private state in
each sentence, a private state frame is defined. A private state frame
includes the source of the private state (i.e., whose private state is
being expressed), the target (i.e., what the private state is about), and
various properties involving intensity, significance, and type of attitude.
An important property of sources in the annotation scheme is that they
are nested, reflecting the fact that private states and speech events
are often embedded in one another. The representation scheme also
includes frames representing material that is attributed to a source,
but is presented objectively, without evaluation, speculation, or other
type of private state by that source.
The annotation scheme has been employed in the manual annota-
tion of a 10,000-sentence corpus of articles from the world press.1 We
describe the annotation procedure in this paper, and present the results
of an inter-annotator agreement study.
A focus of this work is identifying private state expressions in con-
text, rather than judging words and phrases themselves, out of context.
That is, the annotators are not presented with word- or phrase-lists
to judge (as in, e.g., Osgood et al. (1957), Heise (1965; 2001), and
Subasic and Huettner (2001)). Furthermore, the annotation instruc-
tions do not specify how specific words should be annotated, and the
annotators were not limited to marking any particular words, parts of
speech, or grammatical categories. Consequently, a tremendous range
of words and constituents were marked by the annotators, not only
adjectives, modals, and adverbs, but also verbs, nouns, and various
types of constituents. The contextual nature of the annotations makes
the annotated data valuable for studying ambiguities that arise with
subjective language. Such ambiguities range from word-sense ambiguity
(e.g., objective senses of interest as in interest rate versus subjective
senses as in take an interest in), to ambiguity in idiomatic versus
non-idiomatic usages (e.g., bombed in The comedian really bombed last
night versus The troops bombed the building), to various pragmatic
ambiguities involving irony, sarcasm, and metaphor.

To date, target annotations are included for only a subset of the sentences, as
specified in Section 2.2.

4 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
To date, the annotated data has served as training and testing data
in opinion extraction experiments classifying sentences as subjective or
objective (Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003) and in experi-
ments classifying the intensities of private states in individual clauses
(Wilson et al., 2004). However, these experiments abstracted away from
the details in the annotation scheme, so there is much room for addi-
tional experimentation in the automatic extraction of private states,
and in exploiting the information in NLP applications.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives
an overview of the annotation scheme, ending with a short example.
Section 3 elaborates on the various aspects of the annotation scheme,
providing motivations, examples, and further clarifications; this section
ends with an extended example, which illustrates the various com-
ponents of the annotation scheme and the interactions among them.
Section 4 presents observations about the annotated data. Section 5
describes the corpus and 6 presents the results of an inter-annotator
agreement study. Section 7 discusses related work, Section 8 discusses
future work, and Section 9 presents conclusions.
2. Overview of the Annotation Scheme
2.1. Means of Expressing Private States.
The goals of the annotation scheme are to represent internal mental
and emotional states, and to distinguish subjective information from
material presented as fact. As a result, the annotation scheme is cen-
tered on the notion of private state, a general term that covers opinions,
beliefs, thoughts, feelings, emotions, goals, evaluations, and judgments.
As Quirk et al. (1985) define it, a private state is a state that is not open
to objective observation or verification: âa person may be observed to
assert that God exists, but not to believe that God exists. Belief is in
this sense âprivateâ.â (p. 1181)
We can further view private states in terms of their functional com-
ponents â as states of experiencers holding attitudes, optionally toward
targets. For example, for the private state expressed in the sentence
John hates Mary, the experiencer is John, the attitude is hate, and the
target is Mary.
We create private state frames for three main types of private state
expressions in text:
â explicit mentions of private states
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.4
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 5
â speech events expressing private states
â expressive subjective elements
An example of an explicit mention of a private state is âfearsâ in
(1):
(1) âThe U.S. fears a spill-over,â said Xirao-Nima.
An example of a speech event expressing a private state is âsaidâ in (2):
(2) âThe report is full of absurdities,â Xirao-Nima said.
In this work, the term speech event is used to refer to any speaking
or writing event. A speech event has a writer or speaker as well as a
target, which is whatever is written or said.
The phrase âfull of absurditiesâ in (2) above is an expressive sub-
jective element (Banfield, 1982). There are a number of additional
examples of expressive subjective elements in sentences (3) and (4):
(3) The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to
realize that injustice cannot last long. [âBesieging Arafat Marks
Bankruptcy of Israelâs Policies,â 2002-08-02,By Jalal Duwaydar, Al-
Akhbar,Cairo, Egypt]
(4) âWe foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery,â Tsvan-
girai said. [âAfrica, West split over Mugabeâs win,â 2002-03-14,
National Post, Ontario, Canada]
The private states in these sentences are expressed entirely by the words
and the style of language that is used. In (3), although the writer does
not explicitly say that he hates Sharon, his choice of words clearly
demonstrates a negative attitude toward him. In sentence (4), describ-
ing the election as âdaylight robberyâ clearly reflects the anger being
experienced by the speaker, Tsvangirai. As used in these sentences, the
phrases âThe time has come,â âgentlemen,â âthe assassin,â âinjustice
cannot last long,â âfraud,â and âdaylight robberyâ are all expressive
subjective elements. Expressive subjective elements are used by people
to express their frustration, anger, wonder, positive sentiment, mirth,
etc., without explicitly stating that they are frustrated, angry, etc.
Sarcasm and irony often involve expressive subjective elements.
As mentioned above, âfull of absurditiesâ in (2) is an expressive
subjective element. In fact, two private state frames are created for
sentence (2): one for the speech event and one for the expressive sub-
jective element. The first represents the more general fact that private
states are expressed in what was said; the second pinpoints a specific
expression used to express Tsvangairaiâs negative evaluation.
In the subsections below, we describe how private states, speech
events, and expressive subjective elements are explicitly mapped onto
components of the annotation scheme.

2.2. Private State Frames
We propose two types of private state frames: expressive subjective
element frames will be used to represent expressive subjective elements;
and direct subjective frames will be used to represent both subjec-
tive speech events (i.e., speech events expressing private states) and
explicitly mentioned private states. Direct subjective expressions are
typically more explicit than expressive subjective element expressions,
which is reflected in the fact that direct subjective frames contain more
attributes than expressive subjective element frames. Specifically, the
frames have the following attributes:
Direct subjective (subjective speech event or explicit private
state) frame:
â text anchor: a pointer to the span of text that represents the
speech event or explicit mention of a private state. (text anchors
are described more fully in Section 3.1.)
â source: the person or entity that is expressing the private state,
possibly the writer. (See Sections 2.5 and 3.2 for more information
on sources.)
â target: the target or topic of the private state, i.e., what the speech
event or private state is about. To date, our corpus includes only
targets that are agents (see Section 2.4) and that are targets of
negative or positive private states (see Section 4.4).
â properties:
â¢ intensity: the intensity of the private state (low, medium,
high, or extreme). (The intensity attribute is described further
in Section 3.4.)
â¢ expression intensity: the contribution of the speech event
or private state expression itself to the overall intensity of the
private state (neutral, low, medium, high, or extreme.) For
example, say is often neutral, even if what is uttered is not
neutral, while excoriate itself implies a very strong private
state. (The expression-intensity property will be described in
more detail in Section 3.4.)
â¢ insubstantial: true, if the private state is not substantial
in the discourse. For example, a private state in the con-
text of a conditional often has the value true for attribute
insubstantial. (This attribute is described in more detail in
Section 3.6.)
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.6
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 7
â¢ attitude type: This attribute currently represents the po-
larity of the private state. The possible values are positive,
negative, other, or none. In ongoing work, we are develop-
ing a richer set of attitude types to make more fine-grained
distinctions (see Section 8).
Expressive subjective element frame:
â text anchor: a pointer to the span of text that denotes the
subjective or expressive phrase
â source: the person or entity that is expressing the private state,
possibly the writer.
â properties:
â¢ intensity: the intensity of the private state (low, medium,
high, or extreme)
â¢ attitude type: This attribute represents the polarity of the
private state. The possible values are positive, negative, other,
or none.
2.3. Objective Speech Event Frames
To distinguish opinion-oriented material from material presented as
factual, we also define objective speech event frames. These are used to
represent material that is attributed to some source, but is presented
as objective fact. They include a subset of the slots in private state
frames, namely the text anchor, source, and target slots.
Objective speech event frame:
â text anchor: a pointer to the span of text that denotes the speech
event
â source: the speaker or writer
â target: the target or topic of the speech event, i.e., the content of
what is said. To date, targets of objective speech event frames are
not yet annotated in our corpus.
For example, an objective speech event frame is created for âsaidâ in
the following sentence (assuming no undue influence from the context):
(5) Sargeant OâLeary said the incident took place at 2:00pm.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.7
8 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
That the incident took place at 2:00pm is presented as a fact with
Sargeant OâLeary as the source of information.
2.4. Agent Frames
The annotation scheme includes an agent frame for noun phrases that
refer to sources of private states and speech events, i.e., for all noun
phrases that act as the experiencer of a private state, or the speaker/-
writer of a speech event. Each agent frame generally has two slots. The
text anchor slot includes a pointer to the span of text that denotes the
noun phrase source. The source slot contains a unique alpha-numeric
ID that is used to denote this source throughout the document. The
agent frame associated with the first informative (e.g., non-pronominal)
reference to this source in the document includes an id slot to set up
the document-specific source-id mapping.
For example, suppose that nima is the ID created for Xirao-Nima
in a document that quotes him. Consider the following consecutive
sentences from that document:
(6) âI have been to Tibet many times. I have seen the truth there,
which is very different from what some US politicians with ulterior
motives have described,â said Xirao-Nima, who is a Tibetan. [âUS
Human Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin,
Beijing China Daily, Beijing, China]
(7) Some Westerners who have been there have also seen the ever-
improving human rights in the Tibet Autonomous Region, he added.
[âUS Human Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin,
Beijing China Daily, Beijing, China]
The following agent frames are created for the references to Xirao-Nima
in these sentences:
Agent:
Text anchor: Xirao-Nima in (6)
Source: nima
Agent:
Text anchor: he in (7)
Source: nima
The connection between agent frames and the source slots of the
private state and objective speech event frames will be explained in
the following subsection.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.8
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 9
2.5. Nested Sources
The source of a speech event is the speaker or writer. The source of
a private state is the experiencer of the private state, i.e., the person
whose opinion or emotion is being expressed. Obviously, the writer of an
article is a source, because he or she wrote the sentences composing the
article, but the writer may also write about other peopleâs private states
and speech events, leading to multiple sources in a single sentence. For
example, each of the following sentences has two sources: the writer
(because he or she wrote the sentences), and Sue (because she is the
source of a speech event in (8) and of private states in (9) and (10)).
(8) Sue said, âThe election was fair.â
(9) Sue thinks that the election was fair.
(10) Sue is afraid to go outside.
Note, however, that we donât really know what Sue says, thinks or feels.
All we know is what the writer tells us. Sentence (8), for example, does
not directly present Sueâs speech event but rather Sueâs speech event
according to the writer. Thus, we have a natural nesting of sources in
a sentence.
In particular, private states are often filtered through the âeyesâ of
another source, and private states are often directed toward the private
states of others. Consider the following sentences (the first is sentence
(1), reprinted here):
(1) âThe U.S. fears a spill-over,â said Xirao-Nima.
(11) China criticized the U.S. reportâs criticism of Chinaâs human
rights record.
In sentence (1), the U.S. does not directly state its fear. Rather, accord-
ing to the writer, according to Xirao-Nima, the U.S. fears a spill-over.
The source of the private state expressed by âfearsâ is thus the nested
source ãwriter, Xirao-Nima, U.S.ã. In sentence (11), the U.S. reportâs
criticism is the target of Chinaâs criticism. Thus, the nested source for
âcriticismâ is ãwriter, China, U.S. reportã.
Note that the shallowest (left-most) agent of all nested sources is the
writer, since he or she wrote the sentence. In addition, nested source
annotations are composed of the IDs associated with each source, as
described in the previous subsection. Thus, for example, the nested
source ãwriter, China, U.S. reportã would be represented using the IDs
associated with the writer, China, and the report being referred to,
respectively.

2.6. Examples
We end this section with examples of direct subjective, expressive sub-
jective element, and objective speech event frames. Throughout this
paper, targets are indicated only in cases where the targets are agents
and are the targets of positive or negative private states, as those are
the targets labeled in our annotated corpus.
First, we show the frames that would be associated with sentence
(12), assuming that the relevant source IDâs have already been defined:
(12) âThe US fears a spill-over,â said Xirao-Nima, a professor of
foreign affairs at the Central University for Nationalities. [âUS Hu-
man Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin, Beijing
China Daily, Beijing, China]
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: the entire sentence
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: said
Source: <writer,Xirao-Nima>
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: fears
Source: <writer,Xirao-Nima,U.S.>
Intensity: medium
Expression intensity: medium
Attitude type: negative
The first objective speech event frame represents that, according to the
writer, it is true that Xirao-Nima uttered the quote and is a professor
at the university referred to. The implicit attribute is included because
the writerâs speech event is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence
(i.e., there is no explicit phrase such as âI writeâ).
The second objective speech event frame represents that, according
to the writer, according to Xirao-Nima, it is true that the US fears
a spillover. Finally, when we drill down to the subordinate clause we
find a private state: the US fear of a spillover. Such detailed analyses,
encoded as annotations on the input text, would enable a person or
an automated system to pinpoint the subjectivity in a sentence, and
attribute it appropriately.
Now, consider sentence (13):
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.10
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 11
(13) âThe report is full of absurdities,â Xirao-Nima said. [âUS Hu-
man Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin, Beijing
China Daily, Beijing, China]
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: the entire sentence
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: said
Source: <writer,Xirao-Nima>
Intensity: high
Expression intensity: neutral
Target: report
Attitude type: negative
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: full of absurdities
Source: <writer, Xirao-Nima>
Intensity: high
Attitude type: negative
The objective frame represents that, according to the writer, it is true
that Xirao-Nima uttered the quoted string. The second frame is created
for âsaidâ because it is a subjective speech event: private states are
conveyed in what is uttered. Note that intensity is high but expression
intensity is neutral: the private state being expressed is strong, but
the specific speech event phrase âsaidâ does not itself contribute to
the intensity of the private state. The third frame is for the expressive
subjective element âfull of absurdities.â
3. Elaborations and Illustrations
3.1. Text Anchors in Direct Subjective and Objective
Speech Event Frames
All frames in the private state annotation scheme are directly encoded
as XML annotations on the underlying text. In particular, each XML
annotation frame is anchored to a particular location in the underlying
text via its associated text anchor slot. This section elaborates on the
appropriate text anchors to include in direct subjective and objective
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.11
12 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
speech event frames and further explains the notion of an âimplicitâ
speech event.
Consider a sentence that explicitly presents a private state or speech
event. For the discussion in this subsection, it will be useful to distin-
guish between the following:
The private state or speech event phrase: For private states,
this is the text span that designates the attitude (or attitudes)
being expressed. For speech event phrases, this is the text span
that refers to the speaking or writing event.
The subordinated constituents: The constituents of the sentence
that are inside the scope of the private state or speech event phrase.
This is the text span that designates the target.
Consider sentence (14):
(14) âIt is heresy,â said Cao, âthe âShoutersâ claim they are bigger
than Jesus.â [âUS Human Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11,
By Xiao Xin, Beijing China Daily, Beijing, China]
First, consider the writerâs top-level speech event (i.e., the writing of
the sentence itself). The source and speech event phrase are implicit;
that is, we understand the sentence as implicitly in the scope of âI
write that ...â or âAccording to me ...â. Thus, the entire sentence is
subordinated to the (implicit) speech event phrase.
Now consider Caoâs speech event:
â Source: ãwriter, Caoã
â private state or speech event phrase: âsaidâ
â Subordinated constituents: âIt is heresyâ; âthe âShoutersâ claim
they are bigger than Jesus.â
Finally, we have the Shoutersâ claim:
â Source: ãwriter, Cao, Shoutersã
â private state or speech event phrase: âclaimâ
â Subordinated constituents: âthey are bigger than Jesusâ
For sentences that explicitly present a private state or speech event,
the text anchor slot is filled with the private state or speech event
phrase. Moreover, in the underlying text-based representation, the XML
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.12
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 13
annotation for the private state is anchored on the private state or
speech event phrase.
It is less clear what text anchor to associate when the private state
or speech event phrase is implicit, as was the case for the writerâs
top-level speech event in sentence (14). Since the phrase is implicit, it
cannot serve as the anchor in the underlying representation. A similar
situation arises when direct quotes are not accompanied by discourse
parentheticals (such as â, she saidâ). An example is the second sentence
in the following passage:
(15) âWe think this is an example of the United States using human
rights as a pretext to interfere in other countriesâ internal affairs,â
Kong said. âWe have repeatedly stressed that no double standard
should be employed in the fight against terrorism.â [âChina Hits
Back at U.S. Human Rights Reportâ, 2002-03-06, Tehran Times,
Tehran, Iran]
In these cases, we opted to make the entire sentence or quoted string
the text anchor for the frame (and to anchor the annotation on the
sentence or quoted string, in the text-based XML representation).2
Currently, the subordinated constituents are not explicitly encoded
in the annotation scheme.
3.2. Nested Sources
Although the nested source examples in Section 2 were fairly simple
in nature, the nesting of sources may be quite deep and complex in
practice. For example, consider sentence (16):
(16) The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was âsurprised, to
put it mildlyâ by the U.S. State Departmentâs criticism of Russiaâs
human rights record and objected in particular to the âodiousâ
section on Chechnya. [âMinistry Criticizes âOdiousâ U.S. Report,â
2002-03-08, Moscow Times, Moscow, Russia]
There are three sources in this sentence: the writer, the Foreign Min-
istry, and the U.S. State Department. The writer is the source of the
overall sentence. The remaining explicitly mentioned private states and
speech events in (16) have the following nested sources:
Speech event âsaidâ:
2 In addition, an implicit attribute is added to the frame, to record the fact that
the speech event phrase was implicit. Sources that are implicit are also marked as
implicit.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.13

â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministryã
The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is âThe
foreign ministry said . . .â
Private state âsurprised, to put it mildlyâ:
â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministryã
The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is âThe
foreign ministry said it was surprised, to put it mildly . . .â
The Foreign Ministry appears twice because its âsurprisedâ private
state is nested in its âsaidâ speech event. Note that the entire string
âsurprised, to put it mildlyâ is the private state phrase, rather
than only âsurprised,â because âto put it mildlyâ intensifies the
private state. The Foreign Ministry is not only surprised, it is very
surprised. As shown below, âto put it mildlyâ is also an expressive
subjective element.
Private state âcriticismâ:
â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministry, U.S. State
Departmentã
The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is âThe
foreign ministry said it was surprised, to put it mildly by the
U.S. State Departmentâs criticism . . .â
Private state/speech event âobjectedâ:
â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministryã
The relevant part of the sentence for identifying the source is
âThe foreign ministry . . . objected . . .â To see that the source
contains only writer and Foreign Ministry, note that the sentence
is a compound sentence, and that âobjectedâ is not in the scope
of âsaidâ or âsurprised.â
Expressive subjective elements also have nested sources. The expres-
sive subjective elements in (16) have the following sources:
Expressive subjective element âto put it mildlyâ:
â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministryã
The Foreign Ministry uses a subjective intensifier, âto put it mildlyâ,
to express sarcasm while describing its surprise. This subjectivity
is at the level of the Foreign Ministryâs speech, so the source is
ãwriter, Foreign Ministryã rather than ãwriter, Foreign Ministry,
Foreign Ministryã.
Expressive subjective element âodiousâ:
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.14
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 15
â Source: ãwriter, Foreign Ministryã
The word âodiousâ is not within the scope of the âsurpriseâ private
state, but rather attaches to the âobjectedâ private state/speech
event. Thus, as for âto put it mildly,â the source is nested two
levels, not three.
As we can see in the frames above, the expressive subjective elements
in (16) have the same nested sources as their immediately dominating
private state or speech terms (i.e., âto put it mildlyâ and âsaidâ have
the same nested source; and âodiousâ and âobjectedâ have the same
nested source). However, expressive subjective elements might attach
to higher-level speech events or private states.3 For example, consider
âbigger than Jesusâ in the following sentence from a Chinese news
article:
(14) âIt is heresy,â said Cao, âthe âShoutersâ claim they are bigger
than Jesus.â [âUS Human Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11,
By Xiao Xin, Beijing China Daily, Beijing, China]
The nested source of the subjectivity expressed by âbigger than Jesusâ
is ãwriter,Caoã, while the nested source of âclaimâ is ãwriter, Cao,
Shoutersã. In particular, the Shouters arenât really making this claim
in the text; instead, it seems clear from the sentence that itâs Caoâs
interpretation of the situation that comprises the âclaim.â
3.3. Speech Events
This section focuses on the distinction between objective speech events,
and subjective speech events (which, recall, are represented by direct
subjective frames). To help the reader understand the distinction be-
ing made, we first give examples of subjective versus objective speech
events, including explicit speech events as well as implicit speech events
attributed to the writer. Next, the distinction is more formally speci-
fied. Finally, we discuss an interesting context-dependent aspect of the
subjective versus objective distinction.
The following two sentences illustrate the distinction between sub-
jective and objective speech events when the speech event term is
explicit. Note that, in both sentences, the speech event term is âsaid,â
which itself is neutral.
(4) âWe foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery,â Tsvan-
girai said. [âAfrica, West split over Mugabeâs win,â 2002-03-14,
National Post, Ontario, Canada]
3 As discussed in Wiebe (1991), this mirrors the de re/de dicto ambiguity of
references in opaque contexts (Castaneda, 1977; Quine, 1976; Fodor, 1979).
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.15
16 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
(17) Medical Department head Dr Hamid Saeed said the patientâs
blood had been sent to the Institute for Virology in Johannes-
burg for analysis. [âRSA: Authorities still awaiting final tests on
suspected Congo Fever patient,â 2001-06-18, SAPA, Johannesburg,
South Africa]
In both cases, the writerâs top-level speech event is represented with an
objective speech event frame (that someone said something is presented
as objectively true). Of interest to us here are the explicit speech events
referred to with âsaid.â The one in sentence (4) is opinionated. Its
representation is a direct subjective frame with an expression intensity
rating of neutral, but an intensity rating of high, reflecting the strong
negative evaluation expressed by Tsvangirai. In contrast, the informa-
tion in (17) is simply presented as fact, and the speech event referred to
by âsaidâ is represented with an objective speech event frame (which
contains no intensity ratings).
The following two sentences illustrate the distinction between im-
plicit subjective and objective speech events attributed to the writer:
(18) The report is flawed and inaccurate.
(19) Bell Industries Inc. increased its quarterly to 10 cents from 7
cents a share.
Consider the frames created for the writerâs top-level speech events in
(18) and (19). The frame for (18) is a direct subjective frame, reflecting
the writerâs negative evaluations of the report. In contrast, the frame for
(19) is an objective speech event frame, because the sentence describes
an event presented by the writer as true (assuming nothing in context
suggests otherwise).
When the speech event term is neutral, as in (4) and (17), or if there
isnât an explicit speech event term, as in (18) and (19), whether the
speech event is subjective or objective depends entirely on the context
and the presence or absence of expressive subjective elements.
Let us consider more formally the distinction between subjective
and objective speech events. Suppose that the annotator has identified
a speech event S with nested source ãX1, X2, X3ã. The critical question
is, according to X1, according to X2, does S express X3âs private state?
If yes, the speech event is subjective (and a direct subjective frame is
used). Otherwise, it is objective (and an objective speech event frame
is used). Note that the frames for a given sentence may be mixtures
of subjective and objective speech events. For example, the frames for
sentence (2) given in Section 2.6 above include an objective speech
event frame for the writerâs top-level speech event (the writer presents
it as true that Xirao-Nima uttered the quoted string), as well as a direct
subjective frame for Xirao-Nimaâs speech event (Xirao-Nima expresses
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.16
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 17
negative evaluation â that the report is full of absurdities â in his
utterance). Note also that, even if a speech event is subjective, it may
still express something the immediate source believes is true. Consider
the sentence âJohn criticized Mary for smoking.â According to the
writer, John expresses a private state (his negative evaluation of Maryâs
smoking). However, this does not mean that, according to the writer,
John does not believe that Mary smokes.
We complete this subsection with a discussion of an interesting class
of subjective speech events, namely those expressing facts and claims
that are disputed in the context of the article. Consider the statement
âSmoking causes cancer.â In some articles, this speech event would
be objective, while in others, it would be subjective. The annotation
frames selected to represent smoking causes cancer should reflect the
status of the proposition in the article. In a modern scientific article,
the proposition that smoking causes cancer is likely to be treated as an
undisputed fact. However, in an older article giving views of scientists
and tobacco executives, for example, it may be a fact under dispute.
When the proposition is disputed, the speech event is represented as
subjective. Even if only the views of the scientists or only those of
the tobacco executives are explicitly given in the article, a subjective
representation might still be the appropriate one. It would be the
appropriate representation if, for example, the scientists are arguing
against the idea that smoking does not cause cancer. The scientists
would be going beyond simply presenting something they believe is a
fact; they would be arguing against an alternative view, and for the
truthfulness of their own view.
3.4. Intensity Ratings
Intensity ratings are included in the annotation scheme to indicate
the intensities of the private states expressed in subjective sentences.
This is an informative feature in itself; for example, intensity would be
informative for distinguishing inflammatory messages from reasoned
arguments, and for recognizing when rhetoric is ratcheting up or cool-
ing down in a particular forum. In addition, intensity ratings help
in distinguishing borderline cases from clear cases of subjectivity and
objectivity: the difference between no subjectivity and a low-intensity
private state might be highly debatable, but the difference between no
subjectivity and a medium or high-intensity private state is often much
clearer. The annotation study presented below in Section 6 provides
evidence that annotator agreement is quite high concerning which are
the clear cases of subjective and objective sentences.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.17
18 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
As described in Section 2.2, all subjective frames (both expressive
subjective element and direct subjective frames) include an intensity
rating reflecting the overall intensity of the private state represented
by the frame. The values are low, medium, high, and extreme.
For direct subjective frames, there is an additional intensity rating,
namely the expression intensity, which deserves additional explana-
tion. The expression intensity attribute represents the contribution to
intensity made specifically by the private state or speech event phrase.
For example, the expression intensity of said, added, told, announce,
and report is typically neutral, the expression intensity of criticize is
typically medium, and the expression intensity of vehemently denied is
typically high or extreme.
3.5. Mixtures of Private States and Speech events.
This section notes something the reader may have noticed earlier: many
speech event terms imply mixtures of private states and speech. Exam-
ples are berate, object, praise, and criticize. This had two effects on the
development of our annotation scheme. First, it motivated the decision
to use a single frame type, direct subjective, for both subjective speech
events and explicit private states. With a single frame type, there is
no need to classify an expression as either a speech event or a private
state.
Second, it motivated, in part, our inclusion of the expression inten-
sity attribute described in the previous subsection. Purely speech terms
are typically assigned expression intensity of neutral, while mixtures
of private states and speech events, such as criticize and praise, are
typically assigned a rating between low and extreme.
3.6. Insubstantial Private States and Speech Events
Recall that direct subjective frames can include the insubstantial at-
tribute. This section provides additional discussion regarding the use
of this attribute and gives examples illustrating situations in which it
is included.
The motivation for including the insubstantial attribute is that some
NLP applications might need to identify all private state and speech
event expressions in a document (for example, systems performing
lexical acquisition to populate a dictionary of subjective language),
while others might want to find only those opinions and other private
states that are substantial in the discourse (for example, summarization
and question answering systems). The insubstantial attribute allows
applications to choose which they want: all private states, or just those
whose frames have the value false for the insubstantial attribute.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.18
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 19
There are two cases of insubstantial frames, corresponding to the
following two dictionary meanings of insubstantial:
(1) Lacking substance or reality and (2) Negligible in size or amount.
[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth
Edition, 2000, Houghton Mifflin]
Thus, the insubstantial attribute is true in direct subjective frames
whose private states are either (1) not real or (2) not significant.
Let us first consider privates states that are insubstantial because
they are not âreal.â A ârealâ speech event or private state is presented
as an existing event within the domain of discourse, e.g., it is not
hypothetical. For speech events and private states that are not real, the
presupposition that the event occurred or the state exists is removed
via the context (or, the event or state is explicitly asserted not to exist).
The following sentences all contain one or more private states or
speech events that are not real under our criterion (highlighted in bold).
(20) If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena...
[âEU Sanctions Wonât Work,â 2002-04-11, Haâaretz, Tel Aviv, Is-
rael]
(in a conditional, so not real)
(21) âAnd we are seeking a declaration that the British govern-
ment demands that Abbasi should not face trial in a military
tribunal with the death penalty.â [âUK: Mother of Guantanamo
Detainee Launches Legal Action for Access, Protest,â 2002-03-07,
AFP, Paris, France]
(not real, i.e., the declaration of the demand is only being sought)
(22) No one who has ever studied realist political science will find
this surprising. [âUS is only pursuing its own interests,â 2002-03-
12, Taipei Times, By Chien Hsi-chieh, Taipei, Taiwan]
(not real since a specific âsurpriseâ state is not referred to; note that
the subject noun phrase is attributive rather than referential (Donnellan,
1966))
Of course, the criterion refers not to actual reality, but rather reality
within the domain of discourse. Consider the following sentence from
a novel about an imaginary world:
(23) âItâs wonderful!â said Dorothy. [Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz,
1908, L. Frank Baum, Chapter 2].
Even though Dorothy and the world of Oz donât exist, Dorothy does
utter âItâs wonderfulâ in that world, which expresses her private state.
Thus, the insubstantial attribute in the frame for âsaidâ in (23) would
be false.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.19
20 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
We now turn to privates states that are insubstantial because they
are ânot significant.â By ânot significantâ we mean that the sentence in
which the private state is marked does not contain a significant portion
of the contents (target) of the private state or speech event. Consider
the following sentence:
(24) Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice
in the destruction of human rights. [âUS is only pursuing its own
interests,â 2002-03-12, Taipei Times, By Chien Hsi-chieh, Taipei,
Taiwan]
(not significant)
There are two private state frames created for âsuch wishful thinkingâ
in (24):
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: Such wishful thinking
Source: <writer>
Intensity: medium
Attitude type: negative
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: Such wishful thinking
Source: <writer,US>
Insubstantial: true
Intensity: medium
Expression intensity: medium
The first frame represents the writerâs negative subjectivity in describ-
ing the USâs view as âsuch wishful thinkingâ (note that the source is
simply ãwriterã). The second frame is the one of interest in this subsec-
tion: it represents the USâs âthinkingâ private state (attributed to it
by the writer, hence the nested source ãwriter,USã). The insubstantial
attribute for the frame is true because the sentence does not present the
contents of the private state; it does not identify the US view which
the writer thinks is merely âwishful thinking.â The presence of this
attribute serves as a signal to NLP systems that this sentence is not
informative with respect to the contents of the USâs âthinkingâ private
state.
3.7. Private State Actions
Thus far, we have seen private states expressed in text via a speech
event or by expressions denoting subjectivity, emotion, etc. Occasion-
ally, however, private states are expressed by direct physical actions.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.20
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 21
Such actions are called private state actions (Wiebe, 1994). Exam-
ples include booing someone, sighing heavily, shaking ones fist angrily,
waving ones hand dismissively, smirking, and frowning. âApplaudâ in
sentence (25) is an example of a positive-evaluative private state action.
(25) As the long line of would-be voters marched in, those near the
front of the queue began to spontaneously applaud those who were
far behind them. [âAngry Zimbabwe voters defy delaying tactics,â
2002-03-11, Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia]
Because private state actions are not common, we did not introduce a
distinct type of frame into the annotation scheme for them. Instead,
they are represented using direct subjective frames.
3.8. Extended Example
This section gives the speech event and private state frames for a
passage from an article from the Beijing China Daily (âUS Human
Rights Report Defies Truth,â 2002-02-11, By Xiao Xin, Beijing China
Daily, Beijing, China):
(Q1) As usual, the US State Department published its annual report
on human rights practices in world countries last Monday.
(Q2) And as usual, the portion about China contains little truth
and many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications.
(Q3) Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish Chinaâs image and
exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights
experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of
Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday.
(Q4) âThe United States was slandering China again,â said Xirao-
Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for
Nationalities.
Sentence (Q1) is an objective sentence without speech events or private
states (other than the writerâs top-level speech event). Though a report
is referred to, the sentence is about publishing the report, rather than
what the report says.
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: the entire sentence (Q1)
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.21
22 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
Sentence (Q2) (reprinted here for convenience) expresses the writerâs
subjectivity:
(Q2) And as usual, the portion about China contains little truth
and many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications.
Thus, the top-level speech event is represented with a direct subjective
frame:
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: the entire sentence (Q2)
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
Intensity: high
Attitude type: negative
Target: report
The frames for the individual subjective elements in (Q2) are the
following:
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: And as usual
Source: <writer>
Intensity: low
Attitude type: negative
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: little truth
Source: <writer>
Intensity: medium
Attitude type: negative
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: many absurdities, exaggerations and fabrications
Source: <writer>
Intensity: high
Attitude type: negative
The annotator who labeled this sentence identified three distinct sub-
jective elements in the sentence. The first one, âAnd as usualâ, is
interesting because its subjectivity is highly contextual. The subjec-
tivity is amplified by the fact that âas usualâ is repeated from the
sentence before. The third expressive subjective element, âmany ab-
surdities, exaggerations and fabrications,â could have been divided into
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.22
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 23
multiple frames; annotators vary in the extent to which they identify
long subjective elements or divide them into sequences of shorter ones
(this is discussed below in Section 6).
Sentence (Q3) (reprinted here) is a mixture of private states and
speech events at different levels:
(Q3) Its aim of the 2001 report is to tarnish Chinaâs image and
exert political pressure on the Chinese Government, human rights
experts said at a seminar held by the China Society for Study of
Human Rights (CSSHR) on Friday.
The entire sentence is attributed to the writer. The quoted content is
attributed by the writer to the human rights experts, so the source
for that speech event is ãwriter, human rights expertsã. In addition,
another level of nesting is introduced, with source ãwriter, human rights
experts,reportã, because a private state of the report is presented, namely
that the report has the aim to tarnish Chinaâs image and exert polit-
ical pressure (according to the writer, according to the human rights
experts). The specific frames created for the sentence are as follows.
The writerâs speech event is represented with an objective speech
event frame: the writer presents it as true, without emotion or other
type of private state, that human rights experts said something at a
particular location on a particular day.
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: the entire sentence (Q3)
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
Next we have the frame representing the human rights expertsâ
speech:
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: said
Source: <writer,human rights experts>
Intensity: medium
Expression intensity: neutral
Target: report
Attitude type: negative
Note that a direct subjective rather than an objective speech event
frame is used. The reason is that, in the context of the article, saying
that the aim of the report is to tarnish Chinaâs image is argumentative.
This is an example of a speech event being classified as subjective
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.23
24 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
because the claim is controversial or disputed in the context of the
article. In this article, people are arguing with what the report says and
questioning its motives. The expression intensity is neutral, because the
text anchor is simply âsaidâ. The intensity, however, is medium, reflect-
ing the negative evaluation being expressed by the experts (according
to the writer).
The subjectivity at this level is reflected in the expressive subjective
element âtarnishâ; The choice of the word âtarnishâ reflects negative
evaluation of the experts toward the motivations of the authors of the
report (as presented by the writer):
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: tarnish
Source: <writer,human rights experts>
Intensity: medium
Attitude type: negative
Finally, a direct subjective frame is introduced for the nested private
state referred to by âaimâ:
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: aim in sentence (Q3)
Source: <writer,human rights experts,report>
Intensity: medium
Expression intensity: low
Attitude type: negative
Target: China
According to the writer, according to the experts, the authors of the
report have a negative intention toward China, namely to slander them.
Finally, sentence (Q4) is also a mixture of private states and speech
events:
(Q4) âThe United States was slandering China again,â said Xirao-
Nima, a professor of Tibetan history at the Central University for
Nationalities.
The writerâs speech event is objective (the writer objectively states that
someone said something and provides information about the career of
the speaker):
Objective speech event:
Text anchor: the entire sentence (Q4)
Source: <writer>
Implicit: true
The frame representing Xirao-Nimaâs speech is subjective, reflecting
his negative evaluation:
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.24
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 25
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: said
Source: <writer,xirao-nima>
Intensity: high
Expression intensity: neutral
Attitude type: negative
Target: US
The subjectivity expressed by âslanderingâ in this sentence is multi-
faceted. When we consider the level of ãwriter, Xirao-Nimaã, the word
âslandersâ is a negative evaluation of the truthfulness of what the
United States said. When we consider the level of ãwriter, Xirao-Nima,
United Statesã, the word âslandersâ communicates that, according to
the writer, according to Xirao-Nima, the United States said something
negative about China. Thus, two frames are created for the same text
span:
Expressive subjective element:
Text anchor: slandering
Source: <writer,xirao-nima>
Intensity: high
Attitude type: negative
Direct subjective:
Text anchor: slandering
Source: <writer, xirao-nima,US>
Target: China
Intensity: high
Expression intensity: high
4. Observations
One might initially think that writers and speakers employ a relatively
small set of linguistic expressions to describe private states. Our anno-
tated corpus, however, indicates otherwise, and the goal of this section
is to give the reader some sense of the complexity of the data. In par-
ticular, we provide here a sampling of corpus-based observations that
attest to the variety and ambiguity of linguistic phenomena present in
naturally occurring text.
The observations below are based on an examination of a subset of
the full corpus (see Section 5), which was manually annotated according
to our private state annotation scheme presented in this paper. More
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.25
26 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
specifically, the observations are drawn from the subset of data that
was used as training data in previously published papers (Riloff and
Wiebe, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003), which consists of 66 documents, for a
total of 1341 sentences.
4.1. Wide Variety of Words and Parts of Speech
A striking feature of the data is the large variety of words that appear
in subjective expressions. First consider direct subjective expressions
whose expression intensity is not neutral and that are not implicit.
There are 1046 such expressions (constituting 2117 word tokens) in the
data. Considering only content words, i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs,4 and excluding a small list of stop words (be, have, not, and
no), there are 1438 word tokens. Among those, there are 638 distinct
words (44%).
Considering expressive subjective elements, we also find a large va-
riety of words. There are 1766 expressive subjective elements in the
data, which contain 4684 word tokens. Considering only nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs, and excluding the stop words listed above,
there are 2844 word tokens. Among those, there are 1463 distinct words
(51%). Clearly, a small list of words would not suffice to cover the terms
appearing in subjective expressions.
The prototypical direct subjective expressions are verbs such as
criticize and hope. But there is more diversity in part-of-speech than
one might think. Consider the same words as above (i.e., nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs, excluding the stop words be, have, not, and
no), in the 1046 direct subjective expressions referred to above. While
54% of them are verbs, 6% are adverbs, 8% are adjectives, and 32%
are nouns. Interestingly, 342 of the 1046 direct subjective expressions
(33%) do not contain a verb other than be or have.
The prototypical expressive subjective elements are adjectives. Cer-
tainly much of the work on identifying subjective expressions in NLP
has focused on learning adjectives (e.g., Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown
(1997), Wiebe (2000), and Turney (2002)). Among the content words
(as defined above) in expressive subjective elements, 14% are adverbs,
21% are verbs, 27% are adjectives, and 38% are nouns. Fully 1087 of the
1766 expressive subjective elements in the data (62%) do not contain
adjectives.
4 The data was automatically tokenized and tagged for part-of-speech using the
ANNIE tokenizer and tagger provided in the GATE NLP development environment
(Cunningham et al., 2002).

4.2. Ambiguity of Individual Words
We saw in the previous section that a small list of words will not suffice
to cover subjective expressions. This section shows further that many
words are ambiguous w.r.t. subjectivity in that they appear in both
subjective and objective expressions.
Subjective expressions are defined in this section as expressive sub-
jective elements whose expression intensity is not low, and direct sub-
jective expressions whose expression intensity is not neutral or low and
that are not implicit. The remainder constitute objective expressions.
Note that expressions with intensity low are included in the objective
class. As discussed below in Section 6, the results of our inter-annotator
agreement study suggest that expressions of intensity medium or higher
tend to be clear cases of subjective expressions; the borderline cases are
most often low.
In this section, we consider how many words appear exclusively
in subjective expressions, how many appear exclusively in objective
expressions, and how many appear in both. This gives us an idea
of the degree of lexical (i.e., word-level) ambiguity with respect to
subjectivity.
In the data, there are 2434 words that appear more than once
(there is no reason to analyze those appearing just once, since there
is no potential for them to appear in both subjective and objective
expressions). For each of these word types, we measure the percent-
age of its occurrences that appear in subjective expressions. Table I
summarizes these results, showing the numbers of word types whose
instances appear in subjective expressions to varying degrees. The first
row, for example, represents word types for which between 0 and 10%
of its instances appear in subjective expressions. There are 1423 such
word types, 58.5% of the 2434 being considered.
As Table I shows, a non-trivial proportion of the word types, 33%,
fall above the lowest decile and below the highest one, showing that
many words appear in both subjective and objective expressions. The
following are some examples of these words and their counts in sub-
jective and objective expressions: achieved (2 subjective, 4 objective);
against (15 subjective, 40 objective); considering (3 subjective, 7 ob-
jective); difficult (7 subjective, 8 objective); fact (14 subjective, 7 ob-
jective); necessary (2 subjective, 2 objective); pressure (4 subjective, 4
objective); thousands (2 subjective, 5 objective); victory (3 subjective,
9 objective); and world (13 subjective, 51 objective).
Table II shows the same analysis, but only for nouns, verbs, adjec-
tives, and adverbs excluding the stop words (be, have, not, and no).
Again, we only consider words appearing at least twice in the data.

The degree of ambiguity is greater with this set: 38% of the word types
fall between the extreme deciles.
Although many approaches to subjectivity classification focus only
on the presence of subjectivity cue words themselves, disregarding con-
text (e.g., Hart (1984), Anderson and McMaster (1982), Hatzivassiloglou
and McKeown (1997), Turney (2002), Gordon et al. (2003), Yi et al.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.28
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 29
(2003)), the observations in this section suggest that different usages of
words, in context, need to be distinguished to understand subjectivity.
4.3. Many Sentences are Mixtures of Subjectivity and
Objectivity
As we have seen in previous sections, a primary focus of our annotation
scheme is identifying specific expressions of private states, rather than
simply labeling entire sentences or documents as subjective or objec-
tive. In this section, we present corpus-based evidence of the need for
this type of fine-grained analysis of opinion and emotion (i.e., below the
level of the sentence). Specifically, we show that most sentences in the
data set are mixtures of objectivity and subjectivity, and often contain
subjective expressions of varying intensities.
This section does not consider specific words, as in the previous
sections, but rather the private states evoked in the sentence. Thus,
here we consider objective speech event frames and direct subjective
frames. The expressive subjective element frames are not considered
because expressive subjective elements are always subordinated by di-
rect subjective frames, and the intensity ratings for direct subjective
frames subsume the intensity ratings of individual expressive subjective
elements. We consider the intensity rating rather than the expression
intensity rating, because the former is a rating of the private state
being expressed, while the latter is a rating of the specific speech event
or private state phrase being used.
Out of the 1341 sentences in the corpus subset under study, 556
(41.5%) contain no subjectivity at all or are mixtures of objectivity and
direct subjective frames of intensity only low. Practically speaking, we
may consider these to be the objective sentences.
Fully 594 (44% over the total set of sentences) of the sentences are
mixtures of two or more intensity ratings, or are mixtures of objective
and subjective frames. Of these, 210 are mixtures of three or more
intensity ratings, or are mixtures of objective frames and two or more
intensity ratings.
4.4. Polarity and Intensity
Recall that direct subjective frames include an attribute attitude type
that represents the polarity of the private state. The possible values
are positive, negative, both, and neither.5
5 In the underlying representation, the neither value is not explicit. Instead, it
corresponds to the lack of a polarity value for the private state represented by the
frame.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.29
30 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
One striking observation of the annotated data is that a significant
number of the direct subjective frames have the attitude type value
neither. The annotators were told to indicate positive, negative, or
both only if they were comfortable with these values; otherwise, the
value should be neither. Out of the 1689 direct subjective frames in
the data, 69% were not assigned one of those polarity values. This
large proportion of neither ratings replicates previous findings in a
study involving different data and annotators (Wiebe et al., 2001a). It
suggests that simple polarity is not a sufficient notion of attitude type,6
and motivates our new work on expanding this attribute to include
additional distinctions (see Section 8).
Of the 521 frames with non-neither attitude type values, 73% are
negative, 26% are positive, and 1% are both. Thus, we see that the
majority of polarity values that the annotators felt comfortable mark-
ing are negative values. Interestingly, negative ratings are positively
correlated with higher strength ratings: stronger expressions of opinions
and emotions tend to be more negative in this corpus. Specifically, 4.6%
of the low-intensity direct subjective frames are negative, 20% of the
medium-intensity direct subjective frames are negative, and 46% of the
high or extreme intensity direct subjective frames are negative. Positive
polarity is middle-of-the-road: 67% of the positive frames are medium
intensity, while 15.8% are low-intensity and 17.3% are high or extreme
intensity.
In addition, the stronger the expression, the clearer the polarity.
Fully 91% of the low-intensity direct subjective frames have attitude
type neither or both, while 69% of the medium-intensity and only 49%
of the high- or extreme-intensity direct subjective frames have one of
these values. These observations lead us to believe that the intensity of
subjective expressions will be informative for recognizing polarity, and
vice versa.
5. Data
To date, 10,657 sentences in 535 documents have been annotated ac-
cording to the annotation scheme presented in this paper. The docu-
ments are English-language versions of news documents from the world
press. The documents are from 187 different news sources in a variety
of countries. They date from June 2001 to May 2002.
The corpus was collected and annotated as part of the summer 2002
NRRC Workshop on Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA)
6 This is not surprising, given that many richer typologies of emotions and
attitudes have been proposed in various fields; see Section 7.

their annotations are available at

Note that this paper uses new terminology that differs from the
terminology that is in the current release of the corpus. The two versions
are equivalent and the representations are homomorphic. Later releases
of the corpus will be updated to include the new terminology.
6. Annotator Training and Inter-coder Agreement Results
In this section, we describe the training process for annotators and the
results of an inter-coder agreement study.
6.1. Conceptual Annotation Instructions
Annotators begin their training by reading a coding manual that presents
the annotation scheme and examples of its application (Wiebe, 2002).
Below is the introduction to the manual:
Picture an information analyst searching for opinions in the world
press about a particular event. Our research goal is to help him
or her find what they are looking for by automatically finding text
segments expressing opinions, and organizing them in a useful way.
In order to develop a computer system to do this, we need people to
annotate (mark up) texts with relevant properties, such as whether
the language used is opinionated and whether someone expresses a
negative attitude toward someone else.
Below are descriptions of the properties we want you to annotate.
We will not give you formal criteria for identifying them. We donât
know formal criteria for identifying them! We want you to use your
human knowledge and intuition to identify the information. Our
system will then look at your answers and try to figure out how it
can make the same kinds of judgments itself.
This document presents the ideas behind the annotations. A sep-
arate document will explain exactly what to annotate and how.
[Details about accessing this document deleted.]
When you annotate, please try to be as consistent as you can be.
In addition, it is essential that you interpret sentences and words
with respect to the context in which they appear. Donât take them
out of context and think about what they could mean; judge them
as they are being used in that particular sentence and document.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.31
32 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
Three themes from this introduction are echoed throughout the in-
structions:
1. There are no fixed rules about how particular words should be
annotated. The instructions describe the annotations of specific
examples, but do not state that specific words should always be
annotated a certain way.
2. Sentences should be interpreted with respect to the contexts in
which they appear. As stated in the quote above, the annotators
should not take sentences out of context and think what they could
mean, but rather should judge them as they are being used in that
particular sentence and document.
3. The annotators should be as consistent as they can be with respect
to their own annotations and the sample annotations given to them
for training.
We believe that these general strategies for annotation support the
creation of corpora that will be useful for studying expressions of sub-
jectivity in context.
6.2. Training
After reading the conceptual annotation instructions, annotator train-
ing proceeds in two stages. First, the annotator focuses on learning the
annotation scheme. Then, the annotator learns how to create the anno-
tations using the annotation tool (http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/opinion-
annotations/gate-instructions), which is implemented within GATE
(Cunningham et al., 2002).
In the first stage of training, the annotator practices applying the
annotation scheme to four to six training documents, using pencil and
paper to mark the private state frames and objective speech frames
and their attributes. The training documents are not trivial. Instead,
they are news articles from the world press, drawn from the same
corpus of documents that the annotator will be annotating. When the
annotation scheme was first being developed, these documents were
studied and discussed in detail, until consensus annotations were agreed
upon that could be used as a gold standard. After annotating each
training document, the annotator compares his or her annotations to
the gold standard for the document. During this time, the annotator is
encouraged to ask questions, to discuss where his or her tags disagree
with the gold standard, and to reread any portion of the conceptual
annotation scheme that may not yet be perfectly clear.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.32
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 33
After the annotator has a firm grasp of the conceptual annotation
scheme and can consistently apply the scheme on paper, the annota-
tor learns to apply the scheme using the annotation tool. First, the
annotator reads specific instructions and works through a tutorial on
performing the annotations using GATE. The annotator then practices
by annotating two or three new documents using the annotation tool.
The three annotators who participated in the agreement study were
all trained as described above. One annotator was an undergraduate
accounting major, one was a graduate student in computer science
with previous annotation experience, and one was an archivist with
a degree in Library Science. None of the annotators is an author of
this paper. For an annotator with no prior annotation experience or
exposure to the concepts in the annotation scheme, the basic training
takes approximately 40 hours. At the time of the agreement study, each
annotator had been annotating part-time (8â12 hours per week) for 3â6
months.
6.3. Agreement Study
To measure agreement on various aspects of the annotation scheme, the
three annotators (A, M, and S) independently annotated 13 documents
with a total of 210 sentences. The articles are from a variety of topics
and were selected so that 1/3 of the sentences are from news articles
reporting on objective topics, 1/3 of the sentences are from news articles
reporting on opinionated topics (âhot-topicâ articles), and 1/3 of the
sentences are from editorials.7
In the instructions to the annotators, we asked them to rate the
annotation difficulty of each article on a scale from 1 to 3, with 1 being
the easiest and 3 being the most difficult. The annotators were not
told which articles were about objective topics or which articles were
editorials, only that they were being given a variety of different articles
to annotate.
We hypothesized that the editorials would be the hardest to anno-
tate and that the articles about objective topics would be the easiest.
The ratings that the annotators assigned to the articles support this
hypothesis. The annotators rated an average of 44% of the articles
in the study as easy (rating 1) and 26% as difficult (rating 3). More
importantly, they rated an average of 73% of the objective-topic articles
as easy, and 89% of the editorials as difficult.
It makes intuitive sense that âhot-topicâ articles would be more diffi-
cult to annotate than articles about objective topics and that editorials
7 The results presented in this section were first reported in the 2003 SIGdial
workshop (Wilson and Wiebe, 2003).
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.33
34 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
would be more difficult still. Editorials and âhot-topicâ articles contain
many more expressions of private states, requiring an annotator to
make more judgments than he would have to for articles about objective
topics.
In the subsections that follow, we describe inter-rater agreement for
various aspects of the annotation scheme.
6.3.1. Measuring Agreement for Text Anchors
The first step in measuring agreement is to verify that annotators do
indeed agree on which expressions should be marked. To illustrate this
agreement problem, consider the words and phrases identified by an-
notators A and M in example (26). text anchors for direct subjective
frames are in italics; text anchors for expressive subjective elements are
in bold.
(26)
A: We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it
made us begin to feel that we, as Arabs, were an integral part of
Israeli society.
M: We applauded this move because it was not only just, but it
made us begin to feel that we, as Arabs, were an integral part of
Israeli society.
[âIsraeli Arab Leaders to fight cut in Child Allowances,â 2002-04-23,
By David Rudge The Jerusalem Post, Jerusalem, Israel]
In this sentence, the two annotators mostly agree on which expressions
to annotate. Both annotators agree that âapplaudedâ and âbegin to
feelâ express private states and that ânot only justâ is an expressive sub-
jective element. However, in addition to these text anchors, annotator
M also marked the words âbecauseâ and âbutâ as expressive subjec-
tive elements. The annotators also did not completely agree about the
extent of the expressive subjective element beginning with âintegral.â
The annotations from (26) illustrate two issues that need to be
considered when measuring agreement for text anchors. First, how
should we define agreement for cases when annotators identify the same
expression in the text, but differ in their marking of the expression
boundaries? This occurred in (26) when A identified word âintegralâ
and M identified the overlapping phrase âintegral part.â The second
question to address is which statistic is appropriate for measuring
agreement between annotation sets that disagree w.r.t. the presence
or absence of individual annotations.
Regarding the first issue, we did not attempt to define rules for
boundary agreement in the annotation instructions, nor was boundary
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.34
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 35
agreement stressed during training. For our purposes, we believed that
it was most important that annotators identified the same general
expression, and that boundary agreement was secondary. Thus, for
this agreement study, we consider overlapping text anchors, such as
âintegralâ and âintegral partâ in (26), to be matches.
The second issue concerns the fact that, in this task, there is no
guarantee that the annotators will identify the same set of expressions.
In (26), the set of expressive subjective elements identified by A is {ânot
only justâ, âintegralâ}. The set of expressive subjective elements identi-
fied by B is {âbecauseâ, ânot only justâ, âbutâ, âintegral partâ}. Thus,
to measure agreement we want to consider how much intersection there
is between the sets of expressions identified by the annotators. Contrast
this annotation task with, for example, word sense annotation, where
annotators are guaranteed to annotate exactly the same sets of objects
(all instances of the words being sense tagged). Because the annotators
will annotate different expressions, we use the agr metric rather than
Kappa (Îº) to measure agreement in identifying text anchors.
Metric agr is defined as follows. Let A and B be the sets of anchors
annotated by annotators a and b, respectively. agr is a directional
measure of agreement that measures what proportion of A was also
marked by b. Specifically, we compute the agreement of b to a as:
agr(aâb) =
|A matching B|
|A|
The agr(aâb) metric corresponds to the recall if a is the gold standard
and b the system, and to precision, if b is the gold standard and a the
system.
6.3.2. Agreement for Expressive Subjective Element Text Anchors
In the 210 sentences in the annotation study, the annotators A, M, and
S respectively marked 311, 352 and 249 expressive subjective elements.
Table III shows the pairwise agreement for these sets of annotations.
For example, M agrees with 76% of the expressive subjective elements
marked by A, and A agrees with 72% of the expressive subjective
elements marked by M. The average agreement in Table III is the
arithmetic mean of all six agrs.
We hypothesized that the stronger the expression of subjectivity,
the more likely the annotators are to agree. To test this hypothesis, we
measure agreement for the expressive subjective elements rated with an
intensity of medium or higher by at least one annotator. This excludes
on average 29% of the expressive subjective elements. The average
pairwise agreement rises to 0.80. When measuring agreement for the
expressive subjective elements rated high or extreme, this excludes an
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.35

average 65% of expressive subjective elements, and the average pairwise
agreement increases to 0.88. Thus, annotators are more likely to agree
when the expression of subjectivity is strong. Table IV gives a sample of
expressive subjective elements marked with intensity high or extreme
by two or more annotators.
6.3.3. Agreement for Direct Subjective and Objective Speech Event
Text Anchors
This section measures agreement, collectively, for the text anchors of
objective speech event and direct subjective frames. For ease of refer-
ence, in this section we will refer to these frames collectively as explicit
frames.8 For the agreement measured in this section, frame type is
ignored. The next section measures agreement between annotators in
distinguishing objective speech events from direct subjective frames.
As we did for expressive subjective elements above, we use the agr
metric to measure agreement for the text anchors of explicit frames. The
three annotators, A, M, and S, respectively identified 338, 285, and 315
explicit frames in the data. Table V shows the pairwise agreement for
these sets of annotations. The average pairwise agreement for the text
anchors of explicit frames is 0.82, which indicates that they are easier
to annotate than expressive subjective elements.
6.3.4. Agreement Distinguishing between Objective Speech Event and
Direct Subjective Frames
In this section, we focus on inter-rater agreement for judgments that
reflect whether or not an opinion, emotion, or other private state is
8 Note that implicit frames with source ãwriterã are excluded from this analysis.
They are excluded because the text anchors for the writerâs implicit speech events
are simply the entire sentence. The agreement for the text anchors of these speech
events is trivially 100%.

individual expressive subjective elements.

both annotators (i.e., based on overlapping text anchors), including the
frames for the writerâs speech events. We then measure how well the
annotators agree in their classification of that set of annotations as
objective speech events or direct subjective frames.
Specifically, let S1all be the set of all objective speech event and
direct subjective frames identified by annotator A1, and let S2all be
the corresponding set of frames for annotator A2. Let S1intersection be
all the frames in S1all such that there is a frame in S2all with an overlap-
ping text anchor. S2intersection is defined in the same way. The analysis
in this section involves the frames S1intersection and S2intersection. For
each frame in S1intersection, there is a matching frame in S2intersection,
and the two matching frames reference the same expression in the text.
For each matching pair of frames then, we are interested in determining
whether the annotators agree on the type of frame â is it an objective
speech event or a direct subjective frame? Because the set of expressions
being evaluated is the same, we use Kappa (Îº) to measure agreement.
Table VI shows the contingency table for these judgments made by
annotators A and M. The Kappa scores for all annotator pairs are given
in Table VII. The average pairwise Îº score is 0.81. Under Krippendorfâs
scale (Krippendorf, 1980), this allows for definite conclusions.
With many judgments that characterize natural language, one would
expect that there are clear cases as well as borderline cases that are
more difficult to judge. This seems to be the case with sentence (27)
above. Both annotators agree that there is a strong private state being

is less clear. One annotator sees only an objective speech event. The
other annotator sees a weak expression of a private state (the inten-
sity and expression intensity ratings in the frame are low). Indeed,
the agreement results provide evidence that there are borderline cases
for objective versus subjective speech events. Consider the expressions
referenced by the frames in S1intersection and S2intersection. We consider
an expression to be borderline subjective if (1) at least one annotator
marked the expression with a direct subjective frame and (2) neither
annotator characterized its intensity as being greater than low. For
example, âcitingâ in sentence (27) is borderline subjective. In sentence
(28) below, the expression âobservedâ is also borderline subjective,
whereas the expression âwould not likeâ is not. (The frames identified
by annotators M and S for (28) are given below.)

6.3.5. Agreement for Sentences
In this section, we use the annotatorsâ low-level frame annotations to
derive sentence-level judgments, and we measure agreement for those
judgments.
Measuring agreement using higher-level summary judgments is in-
formative for two reasons. First, objective speech event and direct

subjective frames that were excluded from consideration in Section
6.3.4 because they were identified by only one annotator10 may now be
included. Second, having sentence-level judgments enables us to com-
pare agreement for our annotations with previously published results
(Bruce and Wiebe, 1999).
The annotatorsâ sentence-level judgments are defined in terms of
their lower-level frame annotations as follows. First, we exclude the
objective speech event and direct subjective frames that both annota-
tors marked as insubstantial. Then, for each sentence, an annotatorâs
judgment for that sentence is subjective if the annotator created one or
more direct subjective frames in the sentence; otherwise, the judgment
for the sentence is objective.
The pairwise agreement results for these derived sentence-level anno-
tations are given in Table IX. The average pairwise Kappa for sentence-
level agreement is 0.77, 8 points higher than the sentence-level agree-
ment reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999). Our new results suggest
that adding detail to the annotation task can can help annotators
perform more reliably.
As with objective speech event versus direct subjective frame judg-
ments, we again test whether removing borderline cases improves agree-
ment. We define a sentence to be borderline subjective if (1) at least one
annotator marked at least one direct subjective frame in the sentence,
and (2) neither annotator marked a direct subjective frame with an
intensity greater than low. When borderline subjective sentences are
removed, on average only 11% of sentences, the average Kappa increases
to 0.87.
10 Specifically, the frames that are not in the sets S1intersection and S2intersection
were excluded.

Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 43
7. Related Work
Many different fields have contributed to the large body of work on
opinionated and emotional language, including linguistics, literary the-
ory, psychology, philosophy, and content analysis. From these fields
come a wide variety of relevant terminology: subjectivity, affect, evi-
dentiality, stance, propositional attitudes, opaque contexts, appraisal,
point of view, etc. We have adopted the term âprivate stateâ from
(Quirk et al., 1985) as a general covering term for internal states, as
mentioned above in Section 2. At times in general discussion, we use
the words âopinionsâ and âemotionsâ (these terms cover many types of
private states). From literary theory, we adopt the term âsubjectivityâ
(Banfield, 1982) to refer to the linguistic expression of private states.
While a comprehensive survey of research in subjectivity and language
is outside the scope of this paper, this section sketches the work most
directly relevant to ours.
Our annotation scheme grew out of a model developed to sup-
port a project in automatically tracking point of view in narrative
(Wiebe, 1994). This model was, in turn, based on work in literary
theory and linguistics, most directly DolezÌel (1973), Uspensky (1973),
Kuroda (1973; 1976), Chatman (1978), Cohn (1978), Fodor (1979),
and Banfield (1982). Our work capturing nested levels of attribution
(ânested sourcesâ) was inspired by work on propositional attitudes and
belief spaces in artificial intelligence (Wilks and Bien, 1983; Asher,
1986; Rapaport, 1986) and linguistics (Fodor, 1979; Fauconnier, 1985).
The importance of intensity and type of attitude in characterizing
opinions and emotions has been argued by a number of researchers
in linguistics (e.g., Labov (1984) and Martin (2000)) and psychology
(e.g., Osgood et al. (1957) and Heise (1965)). In psychology, there
is a long tradition of using manually compiled emotion lexicons in
experiments to help develop or support various models of emotion.
One line of research (e.g., Osgood et al. (1957), Heise (1965), Rus-
sell (1980), and Watson and Tellegen (1985)) uses factor analysis to
determine dimensions11 for characterizing emotion. Others (e.g., de
Rivera (1977), Ortony et al. (1987), and Johnson-Laird and Oatley
(1989)) develop taxonomies of emotions. Our goals and the goals of
these works in psychology are quite differentâwe are not interested in
building models or taxonomies of emotion. Nevertheless, there is room
for cross pollination. The corpus that we have developed, with words
and expressions of attitudes and emotions marked in context, might
be a good resource to aid in lexicon creation. Similarly, the various
11 Dimensions corresponding to polarity and intensity are among those that have
been identified.
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.43
44 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
typologies of attitude proposed in the literature might be informative
for refining our annotation scheme in the future.
The work most similar to ours is the framework proposed by Ap-
praisal Theory (Martin, 2000; White, 2002) for analyzing evaluation
and stance in discourse. Appraisal Theory emerged from the field of
systemic functional linguistics (see Halliday (1994) and Martin (1992)).
The Appraisal framework is composed of the following concepts (or
systems in the terminology of systemic functional linguistics): Affect,
Judgment, Appreciation, Engagement, and Amplification. Affect, Judg-
ment, and Appreciation represent different types of positive and neg-
ative attitudes. Engagement distinguishes various types of âintersub-
jective positioningâ such as attribution and expectation. Amplification
considers the force and focus of the attitudes being expressed.
Appraisal Theory is similar to our annotation scheme in that it, too,
is concerned with systematically identifying expressions of opinions and
emotions in context, below the level of the sentence. However, the two
schemes have different foci. The Appraisal framework primarily distin-
guishes different types of private state (e.g., affect versus judgment),
and the typology of attitude types it proposes is much richer than ours.
Currently, we only consider polarity. On the other hand, Appraisal
Theory does not distinguish, as we do, the different ways that private
states may be expressed (i.e., directly, or indirectly using expressive
subjective elements). The Appraisal framework also does not include a
representation for nested levels of attribution.
In addition to Appraisal Theory, subjectivity annotation of text in
context has also been performed in Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003),
Bruce and Wiebe (1999), and Wiebe et al. (2004). The annotation
schemes used in Bruce and Wiebe (1999) and Wiebe et al. (2004) are
earlier, less detailed versions of the annotation scheme presented in
this paper. The annotations in Bruce and Wiebe (1999) are sentence-
level annotations; the annotations in Wiebe et al. (2004) mark only
the text anchors of expressive subjective elements. In contrast to the
detailed, expression-level annotations of our current scheme, the anno-
tations in Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) are sentence-level subjective
vs. objective and polarity judgments.
In some research that involves subjective language, lexicons are cre-
ated by compiling lists of words and judging the words as to their
polarity, intensity, or any number of other properties of subjective lan-
guage. The goals of these works are wide ranging. Osgood et al. (1957)
and Heise (1965; 2001), for example, aim to develop dimensional models
of affect. In work by Hart (1984), Anderson and McMaster (1982),
Biber and Finegan (1989), Subasic and Heuttner (2001), and others,
the lexicons are used to automatically characterize political texts, lit-
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.44
Annotating Opinions and Emotions in Language 45
erature, news, and other types of discourse, along various subjective
lines. Recent work by Kaufer et al. (2004) is noteworthy. In a multi-
year project, judges compiled lists of strings that âprimeâ readers with
respect to various categories, including many subjectivity categories.
Although the lexicons that result from these works are valuable, they
fail to capture, as our annotation scheme does, how subjective language
is used in context in the documents where it appears.
What is innovative about our work is that it pulls together into one
linguistic annotation scheme both the concept of private states and the
concept of nested sources, and applies the scheme comprehensively to a
large corpus, with the goal of annotating expressions in context, below
the level of the sentence.
8. Future Work
The main goal behind the annotation scheme presented in this paper
is to support the development and evaluation of NLP systems that
exploit knowledge of opinions in applications. We have recently begun
a project to incorporate knowledge of opinions into automatic question
answering systems. The goals are to automatically extract the frames of
our annotation scheme from text, using the annotated data for training
and testing, and then to incorporate the extracted information into a
summary representation of opinions that will summarize the opinions
expressed in a document or group of documents (Cardie et al., 2003).
Building the summary representations will force us to address questions
such as which private states are similar to each other, and which source
agents in a text are presented as sharing the same opinion (Bergler,
1992). Initial results in this project are described in Wilson et al. (2004)
and Breck and Cardie (2004).
The most immediate refinement we plan for our annotation scheme
involves the attitude type attribute. Drawing on work in linguistics, psy-
chology, and content analysis in attitude typologies (e.g., Ortony et al.
(1987), Johnson-Laird and Oatley (1989), Martin (2000), White (2002),
and Kaufer et al. (2004)), we will refine the attitude type attribute to
include subtypes such as emotion, warning, stance, uncertainty, con-
dition, cognition, intention, and evaluation. The values will include
polarity values and degrees of certainty, enabling us to distinguish
among, for example, positive emotions, negative evaluations, strong
certainty, and weak uncertainty. A single private state frame will po-
tentially include more than one attitude type and value, since a single
expression often implies multiple types of attitudes. There has already
been a fair amount of work developing typologies of attitude and emo-
wiebeetal.tex; 26/04/2005; 12:25; p.45
46 Wiebe, Wilson, and Cardie
tion types, as mentioned above. Our research goal is not to develop a
new typology. Our hope is that including a richer set of attitude types in
our corpus annotations will contribute to a new understanding of how
attitudes of various types and in various combinations are expressed
linguistically in context.
The next aspect of the annotation scheme to be elaborated will be
the annotation of targets. To date, only a limited set are annotated, as
described above in Section 2. We will include targets that are entities
who are not agents, as well as propositional targets (e.g., âMary is
sweetâ in âJohn believes that Mary is sweetâ). Frames with more than
one type of attitude may contain more than one target, reflecting, for
example, that a phrase expresses a negative evaluation toward one thing
and a positive evaluation toward another.
Longer term research must incorporate reader and audience expecta-
tions and knowledge into the representation. This will involve not only
the presumed relationship between the writer and his or her readership,
but also relationships among agents mentioned in the text. For example,
a quoted speaker may have spoken to a group which is quite different
from the intended audience of the article. Work in narratology (Onega
and Landes, 1996) will be informative for addressing such issues.
Also in the longer term, the bigger pictures of point of view, bias, and
ideology must be considered. Our annotation scheme focuses on explicit
linguistic expressions of private states. As such, other manifestations
of point of view, bias, and ideology, such as bias reflected in which
events in a story are mentioned and which roles are assigned to the
participants (e.g., insurgent versus soldier), are outside the purview
of our annotation scheme. Even so, a promising area of investigation
would be corpus studies of interactions among these various factors.
9. Conclusions
This paper described a detailed annotation scheme that identifies key
components and properties of opinions and emotions in language. The
scheme pulls together into one linguistic annotation scheme both the
concept of private states and the concept of nested sources, and ap-
plies the scheme comprehensively to a large corpus, with the goal of
annotating expressions in context, below the level of the sentence.
Several examples illustrating the scheme were given, and a corpus
annotation project was described, including the results of an inter-
annotator agreement study. The annotated corpus is freely available at
http://nrrc.mitre.org/NRRC/publications.htm.We hope this work will
be useful to others working in corpus-based explorations of subjective

language and that it will encourage NLP researchers to experiment
with subjective language in their applications.
