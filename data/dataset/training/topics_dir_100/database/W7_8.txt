MySQL Databases 
The Development Sandbox 
XAMPP 
XAMPP is a cross-platform open-source web server which contains the Apache HTTP 
Server, a MySQL database, and interpreters for PHP and PERL.  We will use this to allow use 
to test our work on our local machines.  The version we are using is the portable version.  If 
you would like more information on XAMPP and other development server tools, feel free 
to contact Kate after this workshop. 
Starting XAMPP 
• Open the Workshop folder on your flash drive

• Find and click on the applications table in the Connections tab in the left-panel 
• The applications table will appear in the right-panel 
• Click Data within the applications tab 
 
 
• Now click back to the TAIR Workshop tab 
 
 
• You will notice that the data are the same, because our query searched for all 
records within the applications table 
• To save the query, do one of the following: 
o Go to File > Save 
o Click the Save icon  
o Press Ctrl+S 
Note: Saving the query saves the SQL statements, not the query results.  To save the 
query results, you will need export the results to a file.  Please see the Tips & Tricks 
section for more on exporting query results.

SQL Syntax 
Select Records 
select ID, 
       academic_period, 
       major, 
       major_desc, 
       degree, 
       degree_desc, 
       student_level, 
       student_classification, 
       campus 
from student.student; 
 
Use the asterisk to select ALL fields (columns) 
select * 
from student.student; 
Note: in MySQL, you must name the database in the from statement – database.table 
 
Select Distinct Records 
select distinct academic_period 
from student.student;

Count Records 
When validating data, it can be handy to quickly count the number of records returned in a 
query.  This can be accomplished by one of two methods: 
• SQL Syntax Method 
o In the SELECT statement, instead of listing variables, type 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
o This counts all the rows in the query and displays the count in the Query 
Results window 
 
• Query Results Method 
o After a query is run, right-click within the Query Results window 
o Select Count Rows 
 
o The number of rows will be returned in a pop-up window

Where Clause 
select *

where academic_period = 201210; 
 
Using Like in the Where Clause 
select * 
from student.person

Joins 
• Inner Join 
select * 
from student.degrees 
join student.person 
on degrees.id = person.id

• Outer Join 
select *

Table/View Aliases 
Aliases for tables and views are most convenient when working with multiple tables.  Using 
aliases allows for few keystrokes and cleaner code.  For example, the code below does not 
use aliases: 
select * 
from student.student 
left join student.degrees 
  on student.id = degrees.id 
where student.academic_period = 200910; 
Using aliases helps make the code more readable and takes less time to type. 
select * 
from student.student s 
left join student.degrees d 
  on s.id = d.id 
where s.academic_period = 200910; 
 
Limit cases 
select * 
from student.person 
limit 10; 
 
Order By 
select * 
from student.person 
order by last_name asc;
