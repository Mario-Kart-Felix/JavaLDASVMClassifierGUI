The Department
The department began offering degrees in computer science in
1983.  Currently the department has nine full-time faculty
members and a number of part-time instructors.  It offers a full
range of undergraduate and graduate courses in computer
science and information technology. Today we have over 210
undergraduate students and over 30 graduate students.  We offer
a Bachelor of Science degrees in Computer Science, a Bachelor
of Science in Informatics, an Associate of Science degree in
computer sciences, four certificate programs, a minor in
computer science, a minor in cognitive science, and a minor in
informatics. In addition, our department offers a Master of
Science degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
jointly with the Department of Mathematical Sciences.  We also
provide key computing courses for the Master of Science degree
in Management of Information Technology (MS-MIT), offered
by the School of Business and Economics.

Mission
Our mission is to provide the highest quality education in the most enjoyable and
friendly atmosphere possible.  In pursuing this mission we work hard to attract the
most highly qualified faculty to our program.  Our faculty play an essential role in
our ability to develop and maintain a high quality computer science program at
IUSB. Accordingly, we seek to attract faculty with strong applied research
potential, instructional ability and communication skills necessary for the mutual
benefit of the university, business,  scientific and engineering communities.  Our
goal is to bridge the gap between theories and concepts presented in the classroom
and real life business and industry needs and practices.
We have charted a course to develop many exciting and challenging projects over
the next five years.  Some of these are given below:
     - Develop a masters program in Software Engineering. 
     - Prepare for accreditation of our B.S. in Computer Science by the Computer
Science Accreditation Board (CSAB).  Accreditation will externally validate
the quality that already exists in our programs.
     - Continue to refine our informatics program, develop new cognates, and
attract more students.
In addition to the above, we will continue to
     - improve our teaching and research environment for our students and faculty,
and aggressively recruit the best and brightest faculty to our department.
     - improve our laboratories. 
     - expand our community outreach program. 
     - mentor our students, and support their learning, research and creative
activities.  
    - Continue to work on our long term goal of offering a Ph.D. in computer
science.

Study of computer science and its applications to human problems, life and culture continue to
be of great interest to me.  Barely 50 years old, our discipline, has made significant progress in
developing advanced software systems rivaling many of human kinds scientific and
engineering marvels.  Today’s operating systems, databases and computer networks are only
a few examples.  Perhaps, the most progress however, has been realized as the result of
contribution of computer science to furthering knowledge and understanding in other
disciplines.

Research interests:
     • My research is directed towards the computational analysis of biological macromoloecules.
Basically trying to understand signals encoded in biological macromolecules by using
computational approaches I focus my research on using neural nets, support vector machines
and other learning machines to extract signals and develop methods to understand how the
learned information is stored. The other focus of my research is on protein structure analysis.
This basically involves understanding structural perterbations as a result of mutation and its
propagation.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in different models of computation, descriptional and
computational aspects of programming and natural languages, and algorithm complexity. From
the practical point of view, I investigate efficient methods of implementing automata, and their
integration in software applications, such as editors, compilers and interpreters. Recently, I have
studied automata models for computer-assisted web service design.

The computer has pervaded many aspects of modern day-to-day life.  Checking email,
browsing news items, and playing games are but a few of the ways people utilize their
computers each day.  Being able to use computers has become important for everyone and the
ability to develop new software, new architectures, and to improve existing systems is
important for graduates in the field.  I am interested in teaching both existing applications as
well as leading students who want to understand and possibly produce leading-edge hardware
and software systems.
