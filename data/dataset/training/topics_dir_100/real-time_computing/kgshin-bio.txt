Computing, the 2010 & 2000 USENIX Annual Technical Conference, the 2003 IEEE  IWQoS, 
and  the 1996 IEEE Real-Time Technology and Application Symposium. He also won the 2003 
IEEE Communications Society William R. Bennett Prize Paper Award and the 1987 
Outstanding IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control Paper Award. He has also received 
several institutional awards, including the Research Excellence Award in 1989, Outstanding 
Achievement Award in 1999, Service Excellence Award in 2000, Distinguished Faculty 
Achievement Award in 2001, and Stephen Attwood Award in 2004 from The University of 
Michigan (the highest honor bestowed to Michigan Engineering faculty); a Distinguished 
Alumni Award of the College of Engineering, Seoul National University in 2002; 2003 IEEE 
RTC Technical Achievement Award; and 2006 Ho-Am Prize in Engineering.
