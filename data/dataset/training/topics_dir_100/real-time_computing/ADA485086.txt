INTRODUCTION 
 
Temporal relationships have always been an important element in the measurement and control of 
industrial physical systems.  In small closed systems time is usually implicit in the operation of electronic 
circuits or in the execution patterns of computer programs.  As these industrial systems become more 
complex with sensors, actuators, and computers distributed in space and communicating via networks, the 
explicit representation of time is often necessary for robust implementations.  The temporal and other 
implementation requirements on industrial systems differ considerably from those found in typical office 
distributed computing environments.  IEEE-1588-2002, “Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization 
Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems,” was designed to serve the clock 
synchronization needs of industrial systems.

TEMPORAL  REQUIREMENTS  FOR  INDUSTRIAL  APPLICATIONS 
 
Application targets for IEEE-1588 are systems typically found in laboratories or in product test, industrial 
automation, motion control, power, or telecommunications system installations and similar industrial 
settings involving multiple sensors, actuators, instruments, and computer/controllers.  Temporal, or 
synchronization, requirements in these applications are typically met in one of three ways: 
 
1. Message-based.  In message-based timing, the sensing of a datum, the setting of an actuator, or 
the initiation of a control procedure is synchronized based on the event of receiving a command 
or message.  IEEE-488 instrument systems and many industrial control systems based on 
proprietary networks are good examples.  In these systems, precise control of communication 
latency and execution timing is required for accurate system wide synchronization. 
2. Cyclic-systems.  In cyclic-systems, timing is periodic and is usually defined by the characteristics 
of a cyclic network or bus, for example the SERCOS bus widely used in the motion control 
industry.  Synchronization accuracy depends of the accuracy of the cycle period and on the 
latency and fluctuations introduced by participating devices in converting the cycle timing into 
the required actions.  
3. Time-based.  In time-based systems, the execution of events is based on a common sense of time. 
For each event an execution time is specified, with the event execution occurring when the 
specified time matches the measure of real-time.  This is the most flexible of the three schemes in 
that different, and if needed incommensurate, timing schedules for each device are easily 
implemented.  In addition, synchronization accuracy depends on the accuracy of the common 
sense of time and on the implementation of the participating devices, rather than on precise 
control of messaging latency.  
 
For the most accurate synchronization in a time-based system, the common sense of time will be 
implemented by having a local clock in each participating node synchronized to its peers via a protocol 
such as IEEE-1588.  The required accuracy in synchronizing these clocks depends on the application. 
Typical applications and their required accuracies are listed in Table 1. 
 
Table 1.  Typical application synchronization requirements. 
 
Application area Required synchronization 
accuracy 
Low speed sensors (e.g. pressure, temperature) Milliseconds 
Common electro-mechanical devices (e.g. relays, breakers, solenoids, valves) Milliseconds 
General automation (e.g. materials handling, chemical processing)  Milliseconds 
Precise motion control (e.g. high-speed packaging, printing, robotics) A few microseconds 
High speed electrical devices (e.g. synchrophasor measurements) Microseconds 
Electronic ranging (e.g. fault detection, triangulation) Sub-microsecond 
 
 
In addition to synchronization requirements, the targeted application areas typically include one or more 
of the following additional requirements: 
 
1. Networking.  Distributed systems increasingly use networks such as Ethernet for communication. 
However, there is still a need to provide a common sense of time on other networks. 
2. Heterogeneous systems.  Most systems have a range of synchronization accuracies.  Therefore, 
the synchronization protocol must accommodate devices with varying accuracy capabilities.

3. Cost.  Systems will include both high- and low-cost devices.  Low-cost devices typically will 
have limited computational capability and memory available to execute a synchronization 
protocol. 
4. Spatial scale.  Most systems are compact enough both physically and logically to be implemented 
in a few local subnets of the communication system.  Larger scale application can usually be 
treated as islands of locally precise time in which a separate protocol, for example GPS, is used 
for inter-island synchronization. 
5. Low administrative overhead.  In the simplest case, the protocol should be self-configuring. 
 
IEEE-1588 is designed to satisfy all of these requirements.  It is not designed to work over the Internet or 
the general computing environment typically served by the popular Network Time Protocol [1].  
 
 
REQUIREMENTS  FOR  MILITARY  APPLICATIONS 
 
While military applications were not explicitly considered during the development of IEEE-1588, it 
appears that many of the characteristics discussed above for industrial systems are applicable to the newer 
generations of military systems.  In particular, military systems are evolving from stand-alone systems 
into architecture of interoperable systems with strong synchronization or coordination requirements.  A 
common sense of time is to be the foundation for this architecture, with the worldwide GPS system as the 
key component.  However, operation must be insensitive to the loss of GPS signals [2].  At least in local 
environments such as a ship or command center, a system based on IEEE-1588 may allow more robust 
local operation by maintaining local time consistency, even when isolated from the global system.  As 
system requirements extend to smaller, less capable, and cheaper military devices, the low 
implementation footprints for IEEE-1588 may be advantageous as well. 
 
Further discussion of applications of IEEE 1588 may be found other papers [3,4].  The remainder of this 
paper discusses performance experience and how IEEE-1588 is structured to meet timing requirements.  
 
 
IEEE-1588  DESIGN  FOR  MEETING  TEMPORAL  REQUIREMENTS 
  
Within a subnet IEEE-1588 automatically establishes a master-slave relationship among the participating 
clocks communicating via the subnet.  The master is selected as the best clock based on defined 
descriptors for inherent accuracy, traceability to UTC, etc.  Provision is made to designate a set of clocks 
to be preferred in this selection for applications where this is important.  
 
The slaves synchronize their local clocks to that of their master by an exchange of messages illustrated in 
Figure 1.  Periodically the master clock sends a distinguished message, a Sync message, as a multicast to 
all its slaves.  This message contains an estimate of when the Sync message will be placed on the 
network. In the most accurate implementations, the master will contain a mechanism for detecting and 
time stamping based on the master’s local clock, the time that the Sync message is actually placed on the 
network.  In Ethernet, an ideal place to attach this detector is at the MII interface of the PHY chip, thus 
avoiding the large temporal fluctuations in the upper portions of the protocol stack.  If the master is so 
equipped, the master’s IEEE-1588 code sends this measured time stamp to all slaves in a second message, 
the Follow_up message.  The slaves receive the Sync message and, if so equipped, detect and time stamp 
its arrival as close to the network as possible.  Upon receiving the Sync message and, for highest 
accuracy, the Follow_up message and the local receipt time for the Sync message, the slave’s IEEE-1588 
code uses this information to correct the time of the slave’s local clock.  Periodically, but with longer 
34th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Meeting 
 246
period to reduce network loading, this process is reversed.  This forward and reverse path information is 
used to compute the one-way network latency on the assumption that the path is symmetrical.  The slaves 
use this measured latency in computing the correction to their local clock.  This procedure effectively 
removes timing fluctuations in the participating end devices and latency in the communication path. 
 
The other major source of timing errors is network latency fluctuations introduced by network elements.  
In an Ethernet environment, this includes repeaters, switches, and routers.  Of these, routers introduce 
fluctuations too large and inconsistent to be reduced to the desired accuracy with statistics.  IEEE-1588 
specifies a transfer standard mechanism, the boundary clock, for logically eliminating routers from the 
IEEE-1588 protocol communication path.  The boundary clock appears to each subnet of interest as an 
ordinary IEEE-1588 clock as provided in an end device.  However, the boundary clock uses a single local 
clock to serve as a master in either all or all but one of the subnets of interest.  In the rare case where 
multiple routers are needed in an application, the boundary clocks themselves form a hierarchy, so that in 
a properly implemented IEEE-1588 system, there is always a single clock serving as the primary source 
of time for the ensemble.  The time base of this clock may be synchronized to a reliable source of UTC 
time, if required. 
 
In the restricted environments typical of the target applications, the fluctuations in repeaters and usually 
in switches can generally be reduced to acceptable levels by the use of statistical techniques amenable to 
low cost devices.  Modern switches implement level 2 protocols that can further reduce fluctuations based 
on the priority of Sync messages [5].  It is also possible to design switches incorporating IEEE-1588 
boundary clocks that logically remove them from the IEEE-1588 communication paths. This technique 
effectively produces direct synchronization between the clocks in the end device and the switch. 
 
Further details on these mechanisms and other features of IEEE-1588 beyond the scope of this paper may 
be found in the standard itself or on the IEEE-1588 Web site [4].  
 
 
IEEE-1588  PERFORMANCE  EXPERIENCE 
 
This section discusses performance measurements on a prototype implementation of IEEE-1588 under 
varying network topologies.  The measurements are made as illustrated in Figure 2.  The ASIC shown 
contains a 68020 class 40 Mhz processor, a Sync message detector observing the MII interface as 
illustrated in Figure 1, and a hardware real-time clock with a resolution of 25 ns.  Each clock has a 1 PPS 
test point that rolls over at the seconds boundary of the clock.  An Agilent 5372A Frequency and Time 
Analyzer is used to measure the relative offsets between the 1 PPS signals of the master and slave.  In 
each case, the data represent statistics on 3,600 measurements made over a 1-hour period. 
 
The prototypes use a simple PI control loop in the slave clocks to servo the local clock to that of the 
master.  The clock offset errors are sampled every 2 seconds as the basis for the PI loop input.  Two sets 
of parameters for the proportional and integral terms in the PI loop are reported.  A fast loop set with P = 
2 and I = 0.5, and a slow loop set with P = 0.5 and I = 0.125.  The fast loop has relatively high gain, wide 
bandwidth, and fast response time, a desirable condition during startup to speed acquisition of lock and to 
drive large initial errors to small values, typically on the order of a minute. 
 
In addition, the slaves implement a statistical algorithm to discard from consideration by the control loop 
obvious outliers in the measured delay and offset between the master and slave.  The data reported here 
were collected with this algorithm disabled to allow observation of the underlying performance of the 
system.

The hardware clocks are driven by 40 MHz crystal oscillators.  Data derived using two different grades of 
oscillators are reported.  The Allan frequency deviations of these oscillators are shown in Figure 3.  The 
CTS CB3LV, an inexpensive oscillator, is typical of oscillators used in cost-sensitive applications.  The 
10811D oscillators are ovenized, instrument-grade oscillators.  Based on the data in Figure 3, the 
expected time fluctuations introduced by the oscillators are shown in Table 2 for several values of the 
averaging time τ.

DIRECT  CONNECTION  BETWEEN  CLOCKS 
 
The direct connection of two clocks, e.g. connected via a crossover cable rather than via a repeater or 
switch, was tested to show the limiting characteristics of the clock implementation free from fluctuations 
introduced by network components.  This case also represents the expected performance for topologies in 
which end devices interact directly with a switch, or any other device, implementing IEEE-1588 
boundary clock functionality. 
 
Figure 4 contains histograms of the synchronization error for two clocks directly connected via Ethernet 
for both inexpensive and 10811D oscillators and for the slow and fast loop parameters.  Figure 5 
illustrates approximately 2-minute segments of the time variation of the clock offsets giving rise to these 
histograms.  
 
The time offset waveforms with the 10811D oscillators are consistent with the hunting or limit cycle, 
behavior introduced by the 25 ns quantization of the two clocks, the resolution and operation of the 
digitally controlled clock rate adjustment of the devices, and the loop parameters.  No fluctuations from 
the 10811D oscillators are significant for the range of parameters used as noted in Table 2.  With the 
inexpensive oscillators and the fast loop (a few seconds time constant), the clocks manage to track the 
oscillator-induced fluctuations well enough to keep the offsets reasonably well bounded, as illustrated by 
the width of the histogram.  However, with the slow loop the fluctuations of the inexpensive oscillators 
become more apparent, as seen in the increased width of the histogram.  The means and standard 
deviations of the measurements in Figure 4 are shown in Table 3.  With the 10811D oscillators, one 
would expect the standard deviations to improve in implementations with finer clock resolution and with 
a true VCO, rather than the digital version of the reported implementation.

CLOCKS  CONNECTED  VIA  A  REPEATER 
 
For these measurements, the clocks were connected via a single HP J4090A Ethernet repeater.  No other 
traffic other than synchronization messages was present on the subnet. 
 
Figure 6 contains histograms of the synchronization error for the repeater connected clocks for both 
inexpensive and 10811D oscillators and for the slow and fast loop parameters.  The means and standard 
deviations of the measurements in Figure 6 are shown in Table 4.

In this case, the repeater introduced measurable fluctuations for all cases, resulting in the increase in the 
widths of the histograms compared to the corresponding cases for the direct connection.  
 
 
CLOCKS  CONNECTED  VIA  A  SWITCH 
 
For these measurements, the clocks were connected via a single HP J4121A Ethernet switch.  No other 
traffic other than synchronization messages was present on the subnet. 
 
Figure 7 contains histograms of the synchronization error for the switch connected clocks for both 
inexpensive and 10811D oscillators and for the slow and fast loop parameters.  The means and standard 
deviations of the measurements in Figure 7 are shown in Table 5.  Comparing the data for the repeater 
and the switch, the switch clearly introduces more fluctuations.

The distributions for the various cases are not sufficiently close to normal to justify detailed calculations. 
However, qualitatively it is clear that the fluctuations due to the repeater and switch either dominate or at 
worst are the same order of magnitude as the inherent characteristics of the nodes themselves.  Further, 
the results for both repeater and switch are relatively independent of the loop parameters used in the 
experiments, although the switch perhaps exhibits smaller effects with the slow loop.  It is clear that the 
differences in the direct connection case indicate that the choice of loop parameters should be optimized 
for the particular oscillator in use.  Although not reported here, prior work has shown fluctuations roughly 
a factor of 2 to 3 higher in the case of repeaters and switches carrying moderate traffic on our laboratory 
LAN [4].  
 
  
SUMMARY 
 
We reported results on prototype IEEE-1588 clocks under a variety of network topologies and 
implementation parameters.  These data indicate that IEEE-1588 will be able to support sub-microsecond 
synchronization in a variety of form factors suitable for the target markets.  The standard has been 
approved by the IEEE and may be ordered via the IEEE Standards Web site [6].

QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS 
 
MARK SHEPARD (G.E. Drives & Controls, Inc.):  As John says, this is a little different area for a lot 
of this conference.  I am with G.E. Industrial Systems down in Salem, Virginia.  We do distributed IO and 
distributed control systems.  We are looking at 1588 as a way to get synchronization of precise 
acquisition as well as control of different processes, phase synchronization of pulse with modulation 
across multiple units, the same sort of paper and metals applications that John was talking about.  And 
this looks like it is going to be very interesting for the industrial Ethernet business overall, but very timely 
for us, and I think a very interesting piece of accomplishment that IEEE has sponsored in this standard.  
Thanks, John.
