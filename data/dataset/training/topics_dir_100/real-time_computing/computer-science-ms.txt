The Computer Science graduate program prepares students for research
and professional practice in computer science and related technologies.
The program includes both fundamentals and advanced work in the
areas of artificial intelligence and databases, programming languages
and software engineering, systems and networks, theoretical computer
science, and visual computing. Graduate classes are divided into basic
classes, which have no graduate course prerequisite, and advanced
classes, which have a graduate class as a prerequisite. Graduate classes
are generally offered in the late afternoon and evening. Financial aid in
the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full-time degree-
seeking students.
Admissions & Policies
Admissions
In addition to fulfilling Mason's admission requirements for graduate
study, applicants must meet the following requirements:
• Hold a baccalaureate degree that includes Data Structures and
Algorithms (CS 310 Data Structures) Automata Theory and Formal
Languages (CS 330 Formal Methods and Models), and Computer
Architecture including Assembly Language (CS 367 Computer
Systems and Programming and CS 465 Computer Systems
Architecture). Students also must have completed Calculus I
and II and a substantial course in discrete mathematics (such as
MATH 125 Discrete Mathematics I (Mason Core)). Students with
some deficiencies in preparation may be admitted provisionally
pending completion of foundation courses in mathematics or
computer science. Undergraduate credit earned for this purpose may
not be applied toward the graduate degree.
• Earned a cumulative GPA of 3.00 for the last two years of
undergraduate work, preferably with a major in a technical field such
as computer science, mathematics, physical sciences, engineering, or
information systems.
• Submit transcripts of all post secondary education, complete the self-
evaluation section of the online application, (This information is used
by the admissions committee to assess an applicant's academic
preparation for the MS program. Students with some deficiencies
in preparation may be admitted provisionally pending completion
of foundation courses required for the program), a goals statement,
resume, two letters of recommendation, and an official GRE score
(only required for those who have not earned a Bachelor's degree
from a US institution).
• International students must submit their English Proficiency scores.

Required Courses and Plan of Study
In addition to general university requirements, completion of the MS
in CS requires 30 credits of graduate courses. Courses are grouped in
the following five broad areas: Artificial Intelligence and Databases,
Programming Languages and Software Engineering, Systems and
Networks, Theoretical Computer Science, and Visual Computing. The list
of preapproved courses with their areas follows.
All the following requirements should be satisfied for the MS in CS
degree:
• CS 583 Analysis of Algorithms (from the Theoretical Computer
Science area) and two additional core courses from two other areas
must be successfully completed with a grade of B- or better.
• At least four courses (12 credits) must be chosen from the advanced
courses in the list of preapproved courses from at least three
different areas.
• At least six courses, including two advanced courses, must be
designated CS.
• At least eight courses must be taken from the list of preapproved
courses. Up to two computer science-related courses that are not on
the list of preapproved courses may be taken with the approval of the
Computer Science Department.
Plan of Study
Before the end of the second semester, students must have a plan of
study approved by their academic advisor. This plan should be kept
up to date by regular consultation with the academic advisor. A final
signed version of the plan must be included when the student submits a
graduation application.
