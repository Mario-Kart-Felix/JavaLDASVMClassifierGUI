Virginia Mathematics Standards of Learning Curriculum Framework 2009 
Introduction 
 
 
The 2009 Mathematics Standards of Learning Curriculum Framework is a companion document to the 2009 Mathematics Standards of Learning and 
amplifies the Mathematics Standards of Learning by defining the content knowledge, skills, and understandings that are measured by the Standards 
of Learning assessments. The Curriculum Framework provides additional guidance to school divisions and their teachers as they develop an 
instructional program appropriate for their students. It assists teachers in their lesson planning by identifying essential understandings, defining 
essential content knowledge, and describing the intellectual skills students need to use. This supplemental framework delineates in greater specificity 
the content that all teachers should teach and all students should learn.  
 
Each topic in the Mathematics Standards of Learning Curriculum Framework is developed around the Standards of Learning. The format of the 
Curriculum Framework facilitates teacher planning by identifying the key concepts, knowledge and skills that should be the focus of instruction for 
each standard. The Curriculum Framework is divided into two columns: Essential Understandings and Essential Knowledge and Skills. The purpose 
of each column is explained below. 
 
Essential Understandings 
This section delineates the key concepts, ideas and mathematical relationships that all students should grasp to demonstrate an understanding of the 
Standards of Learning.  
 
Essential Knowledge and Skills 
Each standard is expanded in the Essential Knowledge and Skills column. What each student should know and be able to do in each standard is 
outlined. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list nor a list that limits what is taught in the classroom. It is meant to be the key knowledge and skills 
that define the standard.  
 
The Curriculum Framework serves as a guide for Standards of Learning assessment development.  Assessment items may not and should not be a 
verbatim reflection of the information presented in the Curriculum Framework.  Students are expected to continue to apply knowledge and skills 
from Standards of Learning presented in previous grades as they build mathematical expertise.
