GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Computer science is the youngest of the sciences and focuses on the 
study of computer software, architecture, theory, and applications. 
This discipline explores computing theory and symbolic computation, 
the nature of computer architecture and operating systems, data 
communications, graphics, software engineering, mathematical 
applications, robotics, artificial intelligence, and system software.
There are many curriculum choices open to students interested in the 
science of computers. Students interested in the hardware aspect of 
computers should look at the vocational and transfer courses offered 
in engineering and electronics programs. Students interested in the 
operations aspect of computers should review the programs offered in 
computer information systems and computer literacy courses.
The Computer science program at SWC focuses on the programming or 
software aspect of computer science and offers three academic pathways 
from which to choose:
• Transfer preparation associate degree for students who plan to 
transfer and major in computer science 
• Career/Technical associate degree for students seeking 
employment at the technician level in science or mathematics 
fields 
• Career/Technical certificate 
CAREER OPTIONS
Many career options are available for the computer science major, 
a few of these require an associate in arts degree, most require a 
bachelor’s degree, and some require a graduate degree. Possible career 
options include: computer scientist, systems analyst, computer service 
coordinator, software engineer, computer graphic specialist, high school 
or college teacher, data base administrator, researcher, program analyst, 
teleprocessing coordinator, knowledge engineer, technical control 
specialist, systems manager, data processing application programmer, 
information specialist and positions available in allied professions of 
business, industry, and scientific technology.

TRANSFER PREPARATION * (MAJOR CODE: 01180)
Most careers in computer science require a bachelor’s degree, and 
some require a graduate-level degree. The coursework for this associate 
degree prepares students who plan to transfer and major in computer 
science with the lower-division computer programming and mathematics 
coursework required by most colleges and universities. 
The program of study listed below is for students interested in the 
programming or software aspect of computer science. It is designed to 
provide a strong foundation in mathematics, programming methodology 
and skills, and computer organization.

engineering, mechanical construction, inspection procedure, building 
codes, quality control management, and license laws for contractors.
CAREER OPTIONS
Below is a sample of the options for construction inspection majors. 
Most require a certificate achievement or an associate in science degree, 
some require a bachelor’s degree, and a few of these may require a 
graduate-level degree: construction inspector, estimator, apprentice 
as a carpenter, electrician, plumber, mason, cement finisher, roofer, 
painter, licensed contractor, soil engineer, architect, project engineer, 
quality control manager, vocational teacher, and positions available in
