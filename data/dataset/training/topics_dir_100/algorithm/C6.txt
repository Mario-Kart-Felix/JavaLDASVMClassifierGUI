Decision or Discrete?
Decision mathematics is also known as 
finite mathematics or Discrete Maths
Why Decision Maths?
Decision mathematics has become popular 
in recent decades because of its 
applications to computer science.
Many of the problems involve Optimisation –
finding an efficient solution – and hence 
methods are applicable to many real world 
situations.
Algorithms
Many problems in this area can be solved by 
applying an Algorithm – a clear, finite, 
terminating list of instructions.
Russian Peasant Multiplication
• Write the two numbers (A and B) you wish to 
multiply, each at the head of a column. 
• Starting with A, divide by 2, discarding any 
fractions, until there is nothing left to divide. 
Write the series of results under A. 
• Starting with B, keep doubling until you have 
doubled it as many times as you divided the first 
number. Write the series of results under B. 
• Add up all the numbers in the B-column that are 
next to an odd number in the A-column. This 
gives you the result.

Königsburg’s 7 Bridges
The city of Königsberg, Prussia (now 
Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel
River, and included two large islands 
which were connected to each other and 
the mainland by seven bridges. The 
question is whether it is possible to walk 
with a route that crosses each bridge 
exactly once.
Leonard Euler investigated this in 1736.

A Graph
This graph has:
•Four vertices/nodes
•Seven edges/arcs
This graph is:
•connected
•not simple
•not complete
•not Eulerian
•not traversable
Another Famous Graph
http://www.metacafe.com/watch/477022/draw_a_envelope_without_moving_the_pen_off_the_paper
This graph has:
•Five vertices/nodes
•Eight edges/arcs
This graph is:
•connected
•simple
•not complete
•not Eulerian
•traversable
The Eulerian path shown is ECDBEDABC
The Solution
Euler realized that the problem could be solved in terms of 
the degrees of the nodes. The degree of a node is the 
number of edges touching it; in the Königsberg bridge 
graph, three nodes have degree 3 and one has degree 
5. Euler proved that a circuit of the desired form is 
possible if and only if there are exactly two or zero nodes 
of odd degree. Such a walk is called an Eulerian path or 
Euler walk. Further, if there are two nodes of odd 
degree, those must be the starting and ending points of 
an Eulerian path. Since the graph corresponding to 
Königsberg has four nodes of odd degree, it cannot have 
an Eulerian path. 
Networks
In the real world, graphs are more likely to 
be networks – the edges have a ‘weight’.
A very common network would be a map 
indicating the road distances between 
towns. 
Famous Network Algorithms
• Prim’s Algorithm (1921- )
• Kruskal’s Algorithm (1928- )
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm (1930-2002)
• Floyd’s Algorithm (1921- )
• Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (maxflow-mincut)
These algorithms are covered in D1/D2.

Linear Programming (LP)
Although the mathematical methods 
required for LP were known by Fourier 
(1768-1830) it was first used as a 
mathematical model by the allies during 
WW2 – and it was kept secret until 1947.
Dantzig published the simplex method in 
1947.
A typical LP Problem
Given a set of constraints…
…you must optimize ‘Utility’
As the name suggests, the constraints and 
the utility function are always Linear!

Typical D1 LP Question
Jane is baking Cookies and Donuts for the school 
fair.
A Cookie needs 30g of flour and 1 egg, and makes 
10p profit.
A Donut needs 20g of flour and 2 eggs, and makes 
15p profit.
Jane has 360g of flour and 20 eggs to hand.
Other ingredients are readily available.
How many of each should Jane bake to maximise 
her profit, and how much profit can she make?
Formulation
x=number of cookies: y=number of donuts
Constraints
Flour: 30x+20y ≤ 360
Eggs: x+2y ≤ 20
Utility
Profit: P=10x+15y

Critical Path Analysis (CPA)
CPA, is a mathematically based algorithm 
for scheduling a set of project activities.
It was developed in the 1950s in a joint 
venture between DuPont Corporation and 
Remington Rand Corporation for 
managing plant maintenance projects.
Modelling CPA
A model of the project is constructed that 
includes the following:
• A list of all activities required to complete 
the project
• The time (duration) that each activity will 
take to completion, and
• The dependencies between the activities.
Real World
In the real world, for large projects, there is 
commercially available software which 
allows the input of activities, precedence 
and durations, which will then produce the 
schedule of events and plot a cascade 
diagram.
One such program is Microsoft Project.

Do students like D1?
YES:
• Little algebra required
• Accessible straight from GCSE
• Most marks are method marks
• Links with subjects like Business and 
Computing
• Full online resources with interactivities.
Do students like D1?
NO:
• memorise some standard algorithms.
• Students take shortcuts and do not score 
full marks
• Doesn’t reinforce many skills learnt in 
Core
• Exam questions tend to be wordy.
