(Received 27 September 1999) 
Numerical methods for second order differential equations with two-point boundary conditions 
are incorporated into a three part method for the solution of a second order nonlinear 
Fredholm integro-differential equation. The interest in this paper is the development of an 
algorithm for parallel processing the discrete nonlinear system. Numerical examples are given. 
Keywords: Fredholm boundary value problems; Parallel processing; Toeplitz systems

1. INTRODUCTION 
In a paper by Carey, Gilmore and Gladwin [4], direct methods for both non- 
singular and singular Fredholm type problems with two-point boundary 
conditions for linear problems were considered. A follow up paper [6] con- 
sidered the nonlinear singular problem using an adaptation of the method 
in [3]. In this article, the work in [8] leads to the implementation of an 
iterative process for solving a nonlinear problem of the form of Eq. (1). Here 
the coefficient matrix for the numerical approximation. is nonsymmetric 
but can be identified with a banded symmetric coefficient matrix and an

of a parallel algorithm for the numerical solution. First, let us state the 
problem:

FREDHOLM B. V. PROBLEMS 
A general k-step method of solution is defined by 
with 
where yi  denotes an approximation to y(xi)  and where {wj) denote the 
weights of the quadrature rule, s is related to the order of the method and 
(ai) and {Pi} are, respectively, the coefficients of the characteristics polyno- 
mials (p, u). For Eq. (2) ,  
Methods for integro-differential equations are denoted by triples (@, r), 
Q, IP) where Q denotes the quadrature rule to approximate the integral and 
IP is the iteration procedure chosen. Here we consider, as an example, 
the five point rule [l, 21 for solving differential equations defined by 
To approximate the integral term, the quadrature rule is chosen to be a 
Newton-Cotes or Newton-Gregory rule which is compatible with the 
order of the method defined by (p, a ) .  For this method and in addition to 
the two boundary conditions, two auxiliary conditions are required. From 
[9], the natural auxiliary conditions for this method are given by 
and 
With these equations added, respectively, as the first and (N- 1)th equa- 
tion in the system, we have the following

R. E. SHAW et al. 
Here, we have an N- 1 x N- 1 system as the boundary conditions have 
been substituted, leading to the terms in R on the right hand side. We note 
that the above method solves the problem in its gwen form. Expressing the 
problem (1) as a system of two first order equations and subsequently 
finding a numerical approximation to the unknown function y(x)  and its 
derivative are considered in [6]. System (3) is solved by an iteration 
procedure (ZP). The coefficient matrix C is banded and near Toeplitz. A 
number of recent articles have appeared which discuss the solution of linear 
systems which are banded and Toeplitz. A paper by Yan and Chung [12] 
provides a LU factorization into a pair of Toeplitz matrices following a 
perturbation of the given system. Another method based on the method of 
oddleven reduction [l l]  offers an approach to solve the system by parallel 
processing. In addition, we see in [5] a treatment of five-band systems which 
can be factored. Once factored, the possibilities for solution include both 
the oddleven method and a parallel version of the work in [12]. For this 
iteratively solved problem, the work by Shaw [lo] provides some insight 
regarding the processing of the right hand side of system (3). In the 
following sections, we consider how the iterative solution of system (3) is 
enhanced in these two ways-processing the approximations to the integral 
terms on the right hand side and implementing a parallel version of the 
method in [12] as part of the iterative solution of the factored system. Two 
numerical examples are presented and solved in the final section.

Again, a perturbed system is to be solved 
By its description, this can be written as two systems and they can be solved 
in parallel. Each diagonal block in D21 is taken to be of size k if n =  2k, 
otherwise the sizes are m and k, where m = k+ 1. Thus, we have 
Each system is solved independently. 
With reference to the FIDE, recall that the vth component of bi is given 
by 
with 
Note that $) = yo and y$) = y,Vi. 
The two systems in (8) can be solved separately, but the solution 
components must be shared before the process is repeated. The idea of 
splitting the system can be extended to four or more subsystems to be solved 
separately and in parallel. As we shall see in the next section, correcting for 
the perturbations requires that each subsystem be of a certain size in order 
to accommodate the desired accuracy of the final approximation.

As in the case of the earlier correction, we attempt to find vectors P and

7 + 4& is not used. 
In a similar manner, we can choose a vector Q such that AQ =en. It is 
easily seen that the components of Q are the same as those of P but in 
reverse order. As a result, Eq. (1 1) becomes 
The values for kj, j=  1,2,3 are only calculated once although they are used

In this section, the five-band method is used to solve two nonlinear 
examples. Two methods are employed to solve the systems that arise in the 
iteration process. The weights for the integration of the integral term are the

Table I contains some results for these two numerical examples. Each was 
solved for three different values of N and the iteration procedure terminated 
using a tolerance of h4 .  In addition, the problems were solved sequentially 
and using the parallel processing ideas in this article. The last column gives 
us the efficiency of the implemented algorithm. The algorithms were coded 
in Fortran 77 and parallel processed using the Portland Group's pgf 77 
compiler on a Linux operating system. The multiprocessor is a Hewlett 
Packard four processor Pentium Pro. The method of solution was 
essentially based on a parallel implementation of the Yan and Chung [I21 
work. Although the split discussed in this work was based on a partition of 
the system into two parts, the four processor computer allowed us to test up 
to a four part split. It must be added that the right hand side of the system 
(3) involved the integration of the integral term over [0, 11 for each equation 
in the system. This allowed us the opportunity to implement a parallel 
approach for processing the integral terms as well. 
In summary, the original system (3) has been replaced by a two part 
procedure consisting of Eqs. (6) and (12). In particular, (6) has been solved 
by a parallel version of Yan and Chung's [12] method and the final 
correction followed using (12). In [8], it was argued that for linear systems

this was more efficient. Here a two part approach has provided an iterative 
solution for the nonlinear examples.
