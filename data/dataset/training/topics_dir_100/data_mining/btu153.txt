ABSTRACT
Summary: The multiplex capability and high yield of current day DNA-
sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome sequen-
cing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of reads into
contigs has been well addressed. The final step of annotating all rele-
vant genomic features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using
existing web- and email-based systems, but these are not applicable
for sensitive data or integrating into computational pipelines. Here we
introduce Prokka, a command line software tool to fully annotate a
draft bacterial genome in about 10 min on a typical desktop computer.
It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or
viewing in genome browsers.
Availability and implementation: Prokka is implemented in Perl and
is freely available under an open source GPLv2 license from http://

1 INTRODUCTION
Genome annotation is the process of identifying and labeling all
the relevant features on a genome sequence (Richardson and
Watson, 2012). At minimum, this should include coordinates
of predicted coding regions and their putative products, but it
is desirable to go beyond this to non-coding RNAs, signal pep-
tides and so on.
There are various online annotation servers (Stewart et al.,
2009). The NCBI provides a Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic
Annotation Pipeline service via email, with a turn-around time
measured in days. RAST is a web server for annotating bac-
terial and archaeal genomes that provides annotation results in
under a day (Aziz et al., 2008), and xBASE2 does similar in a
few hours (Chaudhuri et al., 2008). These classes of tools are
valuable, but they are not useful where throughput or privacy
is critical.
Here we present Prokka, a command line software tool that
can be installed on any Unix system. Prokka coordinates a suite
of existing software tools to achieve a rich and reliable annota-
tion of genomic bacterial sequences. Where possible, it will ex-
ploit multiple processing cores, and a typical bacterial genome
can be annotated in 10min on a quad core desktop computer.
It is well suited to iterative models of sequence analysis and in-
tegration into genomic software pipelines.
2 DESCRIPTION
2.1 Input
Prokka expects preassembled genomic DNA sequences in
FASTA format. Finished sequences without gaps are the ideal
input, but it is expected that the typical input will be a set of
scaffold sequences produced by de novo assembly software. This
sequence file is the only mandatory parameter to the software.
2.2 Annotation
Prokka relies on external feature prediction tools to identify the
coordinates of genomic features within contigs. These tools are
listed in Table 1, and all of them, except for Prodigal, provide
coordinates and appropriate labels to describe the feature.
Proteins coding genes are annotated in two stages. Prodigal
identifies the coordinates of candidate genes, but does not de-
scribe the putative gene product. The traditional way to predict
what a gene codes for is to compare it with a large database of
known sequences, usually at a protein sequence level, and trans-
fer the annotation of the best significant match.
Prokka uses this method, but in a hierarchical manner, start-
ing with a smaller trustworthy database, moving to medium-
sized but domain-specific databases, and finally to curated
models of protein families. By default, an e-value threshold of
106 is used with the following series of included databases:
(1) An optional user-provided set of annotated proteins. These
are expected to be trustworthy curated datasets and will be
used as the primary source of annotation. They are searched
using BLASTþ blastp (Camacho et al., 2009).
(2) All bacterial proteins in UniProt (Apweiler et al., 2004)
that have real protein or transcript evidence and are not
a fragment. This is 16 000 proteins, and typically covers
450% of the core genes in most genomes. BLASTþ is
used for the search.
(3) All proteins from finished bacterial genomes in RefSeq for
a specified genus. This captures domain-specific naming,
and the databases vary in size and quality, depending on
the popularity of the genus. BLASTþ is used for this and
is optional.
(4) A series of hidden Markov model profile databases,
including Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) and TIGRFAMs
(Haft et al., 2013). This is performed using hmmscan
from the HMMER 3.1 package (Eddy, 2011).
(5) If no matches can be found, label as ‘hypothetical protein’.

2.3 Output
Prokka produces 10 files in the specified output directory, all
with a common prefix. These are described in Table 2.
3 RESULTS
Prokka was designed to be both accurate and fast. To assess
accuracy, we compared the annotations of Prokka, RAST and
xBase2 for the highly curated Escherichia coli K-12 genome. All
methods were told it was an E.coli genome. Table 3 shows that
Prokka produced an overall better annotation than both RAST
and xBase2. This result could vary for less well-studied or draft
genomes.
Prokka uses parallel processing to decrease running time on
multicore computers. The most time-consuming steps are
BLASTþ and hmmscan, which both support multiple CPUs na-
tively. However, Prokka is more efficient if it runs multiple single
CPU threads on subsets of the data, which it achieves using
GNU parallel (Tange, 2011). Experiments on our 64-core
AMD Opteron server on single genomes show linear speedup
with up to eight cores and sublinear gain thereafter. However,
for much larger bacterial meta-genome datasets, linear speedup
is observed for many more CPUs. To annotate the E.coli K-12
genome on a typical quad-core desktop computer takes
about 6min.
