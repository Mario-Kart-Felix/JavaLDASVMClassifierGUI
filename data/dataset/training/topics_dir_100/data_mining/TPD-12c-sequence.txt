and my other notes.
What Is Frequent Pattern Analysis?
Frequent pattern: a pattern (a set of items, subsequences, 
substructures, etc.) that occurs frequently in a data set 
First proposed by Agrawal, Imielinski, and Swami [AIS93] in the context 
of frequent itemsets and association rule mining
Motivation: Finding inherent regularities in data
What products were often purchased together? — Beer and diapers?!
What are the subsequent purchases after buying a PC?
What kinds of DNA are sensitive to this new drug?
Can we automatically classify web documents?
Applications
Basket data analysis, cross-marketing, catalog design, sale campaign 
analysis, Web log (click stream) analysis, and DNA sequence analysis.
Why is Frequent Pattern or Association Mining an Essential Task in 
Data Mining?
Foundation for many essential data mining tasks
Association, correlation, causality
Sequential patterns, temporal or cyclic association, partial 
periodicity, spatial and multimedia association
Associative classification, cluster analysis, fascicles (semantic 
data compression)
DB approach to efficient mining massive data  
Broad applications
Basket data analysis, cross-marketing, catalog design, sale 
campaign analysis
Web log (click stream) analysis, DNA sequence analysis, etc
Sequence Databases and Sequential Pattern Analysis
Transaction databases → sequence databases
Frequent patterns vs. (frequent) sequential patterns 
Finding time-related frequent patterns (frequent subsequences)
Applications of sequential pattern mining
Customer shopping sequences: 
• First buy computer, then CD-ROM, and then digital camera, 
within 3 months.
Medical treatment, natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes), science & 
engineering processes, stocks and markets, etc.
Telephone calling patterns, 
Weblog click streams

What Is Sequential Pattern Mining?
Given a set of sequences, find the complete set of 
frequent subsequences
A sequence database
A sequence : < (ef) (ab)  (df) c b >
An element may contain a set of items.
Items within an element are unordered
and we list them alphabetically.
<a(bc)dc> is a subsequence 
of <a(abc)(ac)d(cf)>
Given support threshold min_sup =2, <(ab)c> is a 
sequential pattern
<eg(af)cbc>40
<(ef)(ab)(df)cb>30
<(ad)c(bc)(ae)>20
<a(abc)(ac)d(cf)>10

Challenges on Sequential Pattern Mining
A huge number of possible sequential patterns are hidden in 
databases
A mining algorithm should 
find the complete set of patterns, when possible, satisfying 
the minimum support (frequency) threshold
be highly efficient, scalable, involving only a small  number of 
database scans
be able to incorporate various kinds of user-specific 
constraints 
Studies on Sequential Pattern Mining
Concept introduction and an initial Apriori-like algorithm
R. Agrawal & R. Srikant. “Mining sequential patterns,” 
ICDE’95
GSP—An Apriori-based, influential mining method (developed at 
IBM Almaden)
R. Srikant & R. Agrawal.  “Mining sequential patterns: 
Generalizations and performance improvements,” 
EDBT’96
FreeSpan and PrefixSpan (Han et al.@KDD’00; Pei, et 
al.@ICDE’01) 
Projection-based 
But only prefix-based projection: less projections and quickly 
shrinking sequences
Vertical format-based mining: SPADE (Zaki00)
A Basic Property of Sequential Patterns: Apriori
A basic property: Apriori (Agrawal & Sirkant’94) 
If a sequence S is not frequent 
Then none of the super-sequences of S is frequent
E.g, <hb> is infrequent so do <hab> and <(ah)b>
<a(bd)bcb(ade)>50
<(be)(ce)d>40
<(ah)(bf)abf>30
<(bf)(ce)b(fg)>20
<(bd)cb(ac)>10

GSP—A Generalized Sequential Pattern Mining Algorithm
GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern) mining algorithm
proposed by Agrawal and Srikant, EDBT’96
Outline of the method
Initially, every item in DB is a candidate of length-1
for each level (i.e., sequences of length-k) do
• scan database to collect support count for each candidate 
sequence
• generate candidate length-(k+1) sequences from length-k 
frequent sequences using Apriori 
repeat until no frequent sequence or no candidate can be 
found
Major strength: Candidate pruning by Apriori
Performance on Data Set Gazelle
Motivating Example
Sequential patterns are useful
“free internet access buy package 1 upgrade to 
package 2”
Marketing, product design & development
Problems: lack of focus
Various groups of customers may have different 
patterns
MD-sequential pattern mining: integrate multi-dimensional 
analysis and sequential pattern mining
Extensions of mining sequence patterns
Mining sequential patterns in a database of users’ activities
Given a sequence database, where each sequence s is an ordered 
list of transactions t containing sets of items X⊆ L, find all 
sequential patterns with a minimum support.
An important task for Web usage mining
„20% users which access A page, then go to C page and 
finally select F page”
Our contribution (R.Ziembinski, J.Stefanowski):
Extending a problem into a problem of mining context 
based sequential patterns.

Remarks: 
Agrawal, Sirkant (95) a sequence contains only itemsets
Here: context attributes - defined on different scales
Sequences supporting patterns
Given a database EDS with sets of context attributes A, C and their similarity 
functions, find all maximal sequential patterns among all sequences, which 
are similar to at least min_support sequences in EDS.
