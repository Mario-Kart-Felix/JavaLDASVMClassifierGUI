As cancer treatment demand outpaces the capacity of ambulatory infusion 
centers, clinicians are challenged to provide timely, cost-effective, safe, and 
patient-centered care. Reduction in patient wait times can help address these 
challenges through more efficient care delivery. To reduce patient waiting 
times and operating hours, we developed a mathematical optimization model 
and easy to implement heuristics to generate patient appointment times at an 
infusion center. Our models explicitly considered the uncertainty of patient 
infusion times. We also created a detailed discrete event simulation model to 
evaluate the performance of the new patient appointment schedules. We 
observe that scheduling patients with longer infusion times earlier in the day 
results in shorter patient waiting times and total length of day of operations.

• Appointment schedules 
‒ Baseline 
‒ Longest Processing Time (LPT) 
‒ Shortest Processing Time (SPT) 
‒ Optimization model 
• Output:  
‒ Average patient waiting times

• Goal: Generate appointment schedules that 
reduce patient waiting times and total length of 
day of operations 
• Results: Appointment times, Patient sequence, 
Patient-chair assignment 
• Type of model: Stochastic 
‒ The use of a stochastic model allows us to 
account for the uncertainty associated with 
the duration of patients’ infusion and the 
effect on the length of day and wait times 
‒ Each scenario in the model assigns a 
particular infusion time to each patient  
‒ The variability in each patient’s infusion 
time is accounted for by solving the model 
for multiple scenarios  
• The effect of implementing different patient appointment schedules at an 
infusion center can be approximated by a mathematical optimization model 
• Results of computer simulation suggest that scheduling patients with longer 
infusion times earlier in the day results in reduced patient wait times and 
total length of day 
• Faster to solve optimization model generating better appointment schedules 
• Development of a heuristic that can be easily implemented by schedulers 
• Enhancing simulation model 
‒ Addition of oncology clinic, increased complexity with additional 
nurses, chairs and patients  
• Appointment schedules generated by the optimization model result in 
reduced patient wait times and total hours of operation compared to the 
ones generated by the Baseline schedule, and the LPT and SPT heuristics 
• Initial results demonstrate a 70% reduction in patient wait times using the 
appointment schedules generated by the optimization model

Scheduling Heuristics 
• LPT: Patients with 
longer infusion 
times are scheduled 
earlier in the day 
• SPT: Patients with 
shorter infusion 
times are scheduled 
earlier in the day 
• 60+ hours of student

patient visits were 
reviewed from 3 
different electronic 
health records 
• Integration of
