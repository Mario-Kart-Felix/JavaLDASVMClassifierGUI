1 Introduction
Bilevel programming problems are hierarchical optimization problems in the
sense that their constraints are defined in part by a second parametric opti-
mization problem. Let this second problem be defined first as follows:
min
x
{f(x, y) : g(x, y) ≤ 0, h(x, y) = 0}, (1)
where f : Rn × Rm → R, g : Rn × Rm → Rp, h : Rn × Rm → Rq, g(x, y) =
(g1(x, y), . . . , gp(x, y))
>, h(x, y) = (h1(x, y), . . . , hq(x, y))
>. This problem will

also be referred to as the lower level or the follower’s problem. Let Ψ(y)
denote the solution set of problem (1) for fixed y ∈ Rm.
Then, the bilevel programming problem can be stated as
“ min
y
”{F (x(y), y) : G(x(y), y) ≤ 0, H(x(y), y) = 0, x(y) ∈ Ψ(y)}. (2)
This problem is the bilevel programming problem or the leader’s problem.
Here, F : Rn × Rm → R, G : Rn × Rm → Rk, H : Rn × Rm → Rl. This
problem is a generally nonconvex and nondifferentiable optimization problem
with implicitly determined objective and constraint functions.
The aim of the bilevel programming problem is to select that parameter
vector y describing the “environmental data” for the lower level problem
which is the optimal one in the sense that the function F is minimized subject
to some inequality and equality constraints. The quotation marks in (2) have
been used to express certain ambiguity in the formulation of the problem in
the case of the existence of non-unique lower level optimal solutions. The
Stackelberg game is a problem of mathematical game theory identical to the
bilevel programming problem.
Using the necessary optimality conditions and presupposing validity of
a certain regularity assumption the bilevel programming problem can be
replaced with
min
x,y,λ,µ
{F (x, y)} : G(x, y) ≤ 0, H(x, y) = 0,∇xL(x, y, λ, µ) = 0,
g(x, y) ≤ 0, h(x, y) = 0, λ>g(x, y) = 0, λ ≥ 0}.
(3)
Both problems are equivalent provided that the lower level problem (1) is a
convex one with a unique optimal solution and validity of a regularity as-
sumption for all parameter values. This reformulation illustrates that the
bilevel programming problem is a nonconvex optimization problem. Using
this approach it can be locally transformed into a smooth optimization prob-
lem in the vicinity of a feasible solution provided the lower level problem is
a convex one for which the sufficient optimality condition of second order
together with linear independence and strict complementarity assumptions
are satisfied there. Clearly, these assumptions are very restrictive and can
be rarely satisfied. If these assumptions are not satisfied, this transforma-
tion is not possible since the set of active constraints can change. The usual
constraint qualifications for nonlinear optimization problems (linear inde-
pendence or Mangasarian-Fromowitz constraint qualifications) are violated
2
at every feasible point of (3). We will come back to this later on in Section
6.
Problem (3) is a special case of a mathematical program with equilibrium
constraints, (MPEC)
min
x
{F (z) : G(z) ≤ 0, H(z) ≤ 0, G(z)>H(z) = 0, g(z) ≤ 0, h(z) = 0}. (4)
Here, z = (x, y) and F : Rm+n → R, G, H : Rm+n → Rt, g : Rm+n →
Rp, h : Rm+n → Rq. This problem clearly reflects the optimistic position of
bilevel programming (see Section 2) but it is investigated in a more general
formulation without using uniqueness assumptions for (parts of) the vari-
ables and also without assuming that (part of) the constraints are related to
(parametric) optimization problems.
Closely related to bilevel programming problems are also set-valued opti-
mization problems e.g. of the kind
“ min
y
”{F(y) : y ∈ X}, (5)
where F : X → 2Rp is a point-to-set mapping sending y ∈ X ⊆ Rn to a
subset of Rp. To see this assume that the functions G, H do not depend
on x, the solution set of the system {y : G(y) ≤ 0, H(y) = 0} is identified
with the set X, and F(y) corresponds to the set of all possible upper level
objective function values
F(y) :=
⋃
x∈Ψ(y)
F (x, y).
Thus, problem (2) is transformed into (5). Here we will restrict our consider-
ations to optimization problems with set-valued objective functions and will
not consider problems with constraints in the form of e.g. set inclusions.
Since the first formulation of a bilevel programming problem in an eco-
nomical context in the monograph [v. Stackelberg, 1934] the bilevel pro-
gramming problems as well as the mathematical programs with equilib-
rium constraints have been intensively investigated by many researchers.
The results can be found in the monographs [Bard, 1998], [Dempe, 2002],
[Mesanovic et al., 1970] and [Shimizu et al., 1997] on bilevel programming,
the monographs [Luo et al., 1996a] and [Outrata et al., 1998] on mathemat-
ical programs with equilibrium constraints as well as in the edited volumes
[Anandalingam and Friesz, 1992b] and [Migdalas et al., 1998].

An edited volume on the related set-valued optimization problems is
[Chen and (eds.), 1998], [Jahn, 2000] is a survey on that topic. Earlier an-
notated bibliographies on the present topic can be found in [Kolstad, 1985],
[Narula and Nwosu, 1991] and [Vicente and Calamai, 1994].
Several master’s theses [Scheel, 1994], [Schenk, 1980], [Schulz, 1995],
[Shaw, 1980] and [Vicente, 1992] have been devoted to this topic. The
number of related PhD theses is large. The interested reader is re-
ferred to [Addoune, 1994], [Ben-Ayed, 1988], [Bi, 1992] and [Dempe, 1991],
[Edmunds, 1988], [Moore, 1988], [Nwosu, 1983] and [Oeder, 1988] as well as
[Savard, 1989], [Schmidt, 1995], [Song, 1998a], [Stöhr, 2000], [Vogel, 2002]
and [Wen, 1981a] . Early formulations of bilevel programming problems
can be found in the papers [Kornaj and Liptak, 1965], [Leitman, 1978],
[Luh et al., 1984], [Moraal, 1983], [Ross, 1973] and [Simaan and Cruz, 1973].
The most comprehensive overview over the historical development of bi-
level programming can be found in the monograph [Bard, 1998]. This book
is also very helpful as an introduction into bilevel programming.
As long as it is maintained, an up-to-date bibliography of this topic in
bibtex format can be found in the internet on the page 1

2 Optimistic versus pessimistic or weak ver-
sus strong solutions of the bilevel problem
As it can be seen in the formulation (2) of the bilevel programming problem,
the notion of an optimal solution of this problem is all but obvious if the lower
level problem (1) has a non-unique (globally) optimal solution for at least
one value of the parameter y. Assume for simplicity of the formulation that
the upper level constraints do not depend on the follower’s choice. Then, at
least two ways out of this unpleasing situation can be found in the literature:
First the so-called optimistic or weak formulation
min
y
{ϕo(y) : G(y) ≤ 0, H(y) = 0},
where
ϕo(y) = min
x
{F (x(y), y) : x(y) ∈ Ψ(y)}
1I am interested in adding more references to the bibliography. Please send me related
information via e-mail to dempe@math.tu-freiberg.de
4
and Ψ(y) denotes the solution set mapping of (1) and, second, the pessimistic
or strong formulation
min
y
{ϕp(y) : G(y) ≤ 0, H(y) = 0},
where
ϕp(y) = max
x
{F (x(y), y) : x(y) ∈ Ψ(y)}.
The functions ϕo(y) and ϕp(y) are in general discontinuous, nondifferentiable
and nonconvex. Moreover, they are only implicitely determined, which makes
their minimization demanding.
To the author’s opinion, recommendable papers introducing the chal-
lenges of the pessimistic formulation are [Loridan and Morgan, 1996],
[Lucchetti et al., 1987]. For an introduction to the optimistic formulation
[Dempe, 2002] can be useful. The number of papers investigating optimistic
and pessimistic formulations is large. In the following, we try to cite them
together with a classification with respect to the questions discussed in the
papers.
Different solution concepts in the case when the upper level constraints
do also depend on the follower’s selection are suggested in the paper
[Ishizuka and Aiyoshi, 1992]. In most papers the optimistic formulation is
(implicitly) used and all reformulations of the bilevel problem as optimiza-
tion problem with equilibrium or variational inequality constraints are pos-
sible only in that case. An early formulation of the pessimistic approach
can be found in [Leitman, 1978]. Both formulations have been compared in
[Loridan and Morgan, 1996].
Conditions guaranteeing the existence of an optimal solution are very
different in both cases. They are formulated in [Lucchetti et al., 1987] for
the pessimistic and in [Harker and Pang, 1988], [Lignola and Morgan, 1995],
[Lignola and Morgan, 1998], and [Lignola and Morgan, 2002b] for the opti-
mistic formulations. Problems which fail to have an optimal solution can
be found in [Bard, 1991], [Lucchetti et al., 1987]. Methods to transform the
linear bilevel programming problem with non-unique lower level optimal so-
lutions into a linear bilevel problem with unique lower level solutions are
given in [Bialas and Karwan, 1984], [Wang and Wang, 1994].
Bearing in mind the effort needed for computing all globally optimal
solutions of a nonconvex optimization problem, an alternative notion of an
optimal solution of the bilevel programming problem in the case when the
5
lower level problem is a nonconvex optimization problem is given in the paper
[Vogel and Dempe, 2000].
The investigation of the behavior of perturbed problems is important for
the construction of solution algorithms as well as for the interpretation of
an optimal solution. In the optimistic formulation such results can be found
in the papers [Lignola and Morgan, 1997] and [Mallozzi and Morgan, 1995]
showing e.g. stability of the bilevel problem provided that the set of ε-optimal
solutions of the lower level problem is used instead of Ψ(y). Similar results
in the pessimistic formulation are presented in [Loridan and Morgan, 1988],
[Loridan and Morgan, 1989c], [Loridan and Morgan, 1989d], as well as in
the papers [Loridan and Morgan, 1991], [Loridan and Morgan, 1992b] and
[Mallozzi and Morgan, 1993]. All these results are based on very general
topological assumptions for the problem definition. Conditions guarantee-
ing strong stability of solutions to the mathematical programs with equi-
librium constraints can be found in the paper [Scheel and Scholtes, 2000].
Stability conditions for general MPECs can also be gound in the paper
[Mordukhovich and Outrata, 2001].
Some of the papers aim to suggest different regularization approaches as
for instance adding quadratic strongly convex functions to the lower level
objective function to solve both the optimistic and the pessimistic problems
[Loridan and Morgan, 1992a], [Molodtsov, 1976].
The optimistic and pessimistic solution concepts in set-valued optimiza-
tion can be found in [Ha, 2002a], [Ha, 2002b]. Other solution concepts can
be found in the paper [Jahn and Khan, 2002].
3 Relations to other optimization problems
and complexity
Using necessary (and sufficient) optimality conditions or the optimal value
function of the lower level problem, the bilevel programming problem can be
reformulated as a one-level optimization problem. But there are also more
direct relations between (2) and different well-known optimization problems.
Problem (2) is directly linked to multiobjective optimization problems in
[Fülöp, 1993], [Migdalas, 1995b], to mixed 0-1 linear optimization problems
in [Audet et al., 1997], [Audet et al., 1998], [Frangioni, 1995], and the rela-
tions between bilevel programming and generalized semi-infinite optimization
6
are highlighted in [Stein and Still, 2002]. Moreover, the relations between
MPEC and two-stage stochastic problems with recourse have been investi-
gated in [Patriksson and Wynter, 1999].
Since some of these problems are NP-hard it is clear that also the bilevel
programming problem has this property. The first result in this direction
is given in [Jeroslow, 1985]. The linear bilevel problem has been shown to
be NP-hard in [Bard, 1991], [Ben-Ayed and Blair, 1990], [Blair, 1992] and
to be strongly NP-hard in the papers [Deng, 1998], [Hansen et al., 1992].
This implies also the nonexistence of fully polynomial approximation schemes
for the bilevel programming problem [Deng, 1998], [Hansen et al., 1992].
Polynomially solvable special cases of the bilevel problem can be found
in [Labbè et al., 1998] and [Plyasunov, 2000]. Moreover, if the number of
variables of the lower-level decision maker is fixed, then the linear bilevel
programming problem is also polynomially solvable with respect to the re-
maining data [Liu and Spencer, 1995]. While investigating a standardization
problem, [Gorbachevskaya, 1998a] simultaneously verified that her problem
itself isNP-hard and identified conditions under which instances of the prob-
lem are polynomially solvable.
To the author’s opinion a good paper introducing into the complexity
issue of bilevel programming is [Deng, 1998].
4 Optimality conditions
Optimality conditions are one of the central topics in optimization theory.
For bilevel programming problems different approaches have been given in
[Dempe, 2002]. For mathematical programming problems with equilibrium
constraints, the paper [Scheel and Scholtes, 2000] is recommended.
To formulate optimality conditions it is often necessary to use a one-level
reformulation of the bilevel programming problem. A first attempt in this
direction by replacing the lower level problem with an infinite number of
constraints can be found in the paper [Bard, 1984b], for a counterexample
to a part of the results in this paper see [Clarke and Westerberg, 1988]. A
second approach to formulate necessary and sufficient optimality conditions
uses assumptions guaranteeing that the lower level problem has a unique
strongly stable optimal solution [Dempe, 1989], [Dempe, 1992a] as well as
[Dempe, 1992b], [Dempe, 1993a], [Dempe, 2001], [Outrata, 1993]. In this
case all the results known from nondifferentiable optimization can be used.
7
Necessary optimality conditions using a reformulation of the bilevel prob-
lem by the help of the optimal value function of the lower level problem can
be found in [Liu and Han, 1997], [Ye, 1995], [Ye, 1997], [Ye and Zhu, 1995]
and [Ye et al., 1997], [Yezza, 1996], some of the results in [Yezza, 1996] have
been disproved in [Dempe, 1997]. Duality theory applied to the lower
level problem is used to derive a minimax problem for which then op-
timality conditions can be developed [Malhotra and Arora, 1999]. Neces-
sary optimality conditions of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type can be found in
the paper [Chen and Florian, 1995]. A last attempt consists in the use of
a penalty function approach [Zhang, 1994] or of an exact penalty function
[Bi and Calamai, 1991]. The special case of a quadratic lower level problem
is addressed in [Vicente and Calamai, 1995], [Wang et al., 1994].
With the aim to develop necessary and sufficient optimality condi-
tions for mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints different ap-
proaches have been used. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type conditions can be
found in [Pang and Fukushima, 1999], [Scheel and Scholtes, 2000], condi-
tions based on differentiability conditions for strongly stable lower level so-
lutions are derived in [Outrata, 1994], [Outrata, 1999], and Karush-Kuhn-
Tucker type conditions applying Mordukhovich’s coderivative have been de-
veloped in [Outrata, 2000a], [Ye, 1999], [Ye, 2000], [Ye and Ye, 1997]. Fritz
John and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker type conditions have been obtained in
[Flegel and Kanzow, 2002] together with an application of the Abadie con-
straint qualification to MPECs. Some of these conditions can be linked to
optimality conditions for bilevel programming problems which has been done
in [Dempe, 2002].
Optimality conditions for set-valued optimization problems have been
derived under different assumptions and using various differentiability tools.
Due to the very special structure of bilevel programming problems these
are sometimes too restrictive for bilevel programming. The use of a
Farkas-Minkowski theorem of the alternative is demonstrated in the paper
[Huang, 2002], generalized derivatives for set-valued maps are applied in
[Bednarczuk and Song, 1998], [Chen and Jahn, 1998], [Flores-Bazan, 2001]
as well as in [Götz and Jahn, 1999], [Jahn and Rauh, 1997], [Luc, 1991] and
[Sach and Huy-Dien, 1987], [Yang, 1998]. An explicit description of the set-
valued objective function by finitely many functions is used in the paper
[Craven and Luu, 1997].

5 Solution algorithms
Algorithms solving bilevel programming problems can be subdivided into
three classes: algorithms solving them globally, methods for computing lo-
cally optimal solutions respectively stationary points and heuristics.
The comprehensive insight into methods globally solving bilevel pro-
gramming problems is given in [Bard, 1998]. For the use of methods
of nondifferentiable optimization to mathematical programs with equilib-
rium constraints, the monograph [Outrata et al., 1998] is recommended.
With respect to the behavior of known algorithms for nonlinear optimiza-
tion to mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints, the paper
[Fletcher and Leyffer, 2002] is a first address.
Historically the first methods aimed to solve the problem globally. The
monograph [Bard, 1998] describes a large number of such algorithms. For
linear bilevel programming problems the fact that an optimal solution can
be found at a vertex of the underlying polyhedron can be used. This
results in vertex enumeration methods [Campelo and Scheimberg, 2000],
[Candler and Townsley, 1982], [Önal, 1993] and in the complementary piv-
oting algorithm for the linear bilevel problems [Júdice and Faustino, 1988],
[Júdice and Faustino, 1992] and for problems with quadratic lower level prob-
lems [Júdice and Faustino, 1994], [Vicente et al., 1994].
Barrier and penalty functions are used in [Aiyoshi and Shimizu, 1981],
[Aiyoshi and Shimizu, 1984], and in [Gorelik, 1972], [Gorelik, 1978]. For
more results see [Ishizuka and Aiyoshi, 1992], [Liu et al., 2001] as well as
[Shimizu, 1982], [Shimizu and Aiyoshi, 1981], [Shimizu and Lu, 1995], and
[Wan and Zhou, 2001]. For linear lower level problems penalization of the
duality gap results in an exact penalty function. This is shown in the papers
[Anandalingam and White, 1990], [Bi et al., 1989], [White, 1997], as well as
[White and Anandalingam, 1993]. A penalty function method for linear bi-
level problems can be found in [Amouzegar and Moshirvaziri, 1998].
In the k-th best algorithm the computation of non-optimal vertex so-
lutions in the lower level problem is used to solve the bilevel problem glob-
ally. This is used e.g. in [Bialas and Karwan, 1982], [Mathur and Puri, 1994],
[Mathur and Puri, 1995], [Wen, 1981b]. Branch-and-bound methods where
the complementarity constraints of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker reformulation
of the lower level problem have been relaxed can be found in [Bard, 1988],
[Bard and Falk, 1982], [Bard and Moore, 1992], [Edmunds and Bard, 1991],
[Hansen et al., 1992], in combination with algorithms for locally solving the
9
bilevel problem in [Liu and Zhang, 2001]. Algorithms being based on bicri-
teria optimization are given in [Bard, 1983c], [Ünlü, 1987] which have been
shown to be not adequate in [Wen and Hsu, 1989].
In [Wu et al., 1998] a cutting plane algorithm for linear bilevel pro-
grams is given. An algorithm for a special multilevel linear problem can
be found in [Wang et al., 1996]. The linear bilevel programming problem
has been attacked by transforming the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker reformulation
into mixed-discrete linear constraints and solving the resulting problem
[Fortuny-Amat and McCarl, 1981], [V.Visweswaran et al., 1996].
Global optimization algorithms using the power of d.c. programming are
given in [Al-Khayyal et al., 1992], [Tuy, 1998], [Tuy and Ghannadan, 1998],
[Tuy et al., 1993], [Tuy et al., 1994]. The computation of a good initiation
of this process is investigated in [Muu, 2000]. The successice cone relaxation
algorithm [Takeda and Kojima, 2001] approximates the convex hull of the
feasible set of (2). For some traffic management problem the lower level
problem has been replaced by a projection operator added to the upper
level objective function in [Patriksson and Rockafellar, 2001]. In the pa-
per [Gümüs and Floudas, 2001] the problem is solved by a combination of
a branch-and-bound approach and a convex underestimation of nonconvex
functions.
Bilevel programming problems are nonconvex optimization problems.
Due to the inherent difficulties for solving such problems globally, many
researchers focus their investigations on deriving descent methods for com-
puting stationary solutions. For the linear bilevel programming problem this
enables one to compute a locally optimal solution [Dempe, 1987].
For nonlinear problems there are two main stationarity concepts used.
The first one is coming from Lipschitz optimization and aimes to compute a
Clarke stationary point. Consider the simplest situation where the lover level
optimal solution proves to be locally Lipschitz continuous and it is inserted
into the upper level objective function, which is assumed to be differentiable.
This results in the auxiliary problem
F(y) := F (x(y), y) → min
y
.
Then, a point y∗ is Clarke stationary provided that zero belongs to the Clarke
generalized differential of the function F(y) at y∗:
0 ∈ ∇xF (x(y∗), y∗)∂x(y∗) +∇yF (x(y∗), y∗).
10
The stronger concept of the Bouligand stationarity uses instead of the Clarke
generalized derivative the directional derivative of the function F(y) provided
it exists and calls the point y∗ Bouligand stationary provided that
F ′(y; d) = ∇xF (x(y∗), y∗)x′(y∗; d) +∇yF (x(y∗), y∗)d ≥ 0 ∀d,
where x′(y∗; d) denotes the directional derivative of the (vector-valued) func-
tion x(y) at y∗ in direction d. If the function x(y) is directionally differen-
tiable and locally Lipschitz continuous, Bouligand stationarity implies Clarke
stationarity but not vice versa. If necessary, constraints can be invoked by
moving to Lagrange functions.
The following algorithms for computing Clarke resp. Bouligand sta-
tionary points have been suggested: Bundle algorithms for computing
Clarke-stationary points using sensitivity information for x(y) [Dempe, 1998],
[Dempe, 2000], [Falk and Liu, 1993], [Falk and Liu, 1995], [Outrata, 1990].
Other algorithms being based on sensitivity information of x(y) are given
in [Kolstad and Lasdon, 1990], [Savard and Gauvin, 1994]. All these papers
essentially use that the lower level optimal solution is assumed to be uniquely
determined. An algorithm for the bilevel programming problem with non-
unique lower level solutions computing a Bouligand-stationary point can be
found in the paper [Dempe and Schmidt, 1996]. This uses a regularization
approach and supposes that, in the vicinity of a computed solution, the lower
level optimal solution is strongly stable in the sense of Kojima such that
sensitivity information is available. Descent algorithms for stochastic bile-
vel problems are proposed [Patriksson and Wynter, 1997]. An interior point
algorithm solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker reformulation of the bilevel pro-
gramming problem is given in [Leontiev and Herskovits, 2002]; a trust-region
algorithm is formulated in [Liu et al., 1998].
Theoretically the violation of constraint qualifications can cause dif-
ficulties in the behavior of many nonlinear optimization algorithms. In
contrast, a generally good behavior of many nonlinear programming al-
gorithms (especially all those which converge to so-called AGP points)
applied to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker reformulation of bilevel program-
ming problems in the presence of second-order sufficient optimality condi-
tions and strong complementarity in the lower level problem is shown in
[Andreani and Martinez, 2001].
Heuristic algorithms (including artifical intelligence based heuristics,
simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) have found great interest
11
in the last years especially in discrete optimization. Bilevel program-
ming problems inherit many structural properties from discrete optimiza-
tion at least if the lower level problem is replaced by its (under con-
vexity and regularity assumptions equivalent ) Karush-Kuhn-Tucker con-
ditions. This motivated the attempts to use heuristic algorithms also for
solving bilevel programming problems which has been done in the pa-
pers [Anandalingam et al., 1983], [Friesz et al., 1987], [Friesz et al., 1993],
[Friesz et al., 1992], [Gendreau et al., 1996], [Marcotte, 1986]. For other re-
sults see [Marcotte and Marquis, 1992], [Nishizaki and Sakawa, 1999] as well
as [Sakin and Ciric, 1998], [Wen and Huang, 1996].
Only a very few results are available in the moment with respect to
algorithms solving mixed-discrete bilevel programming problems. Such al-
gorithms are the following: branch-and-bound algorithms for exact and
approximate solutions [Edmunds and Bard, 1992], [Moore and Bard, 1990],
and [Wen and Yang, 1990]. Algorithms being based on parametric linear
discrete optimization can be found in the papers [Dempe and Richter, 2000],
[Jan and Chern, 1990], [Jan and Chern, 1994], and a cutting plane algorithm
in [Dempe, 1996b]. In the paper [Thirwani and Arora, 1997], the k-th best
algorithm is applied to discrete bilevel problems. A penalty function ap-
proach for problems with only a small number of discrete variables is given
in the paper [Kalashnikov and Rios-Mercado, 2002b].
Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints are the topic of two
monographs. The monograph [Outrata et al., 1998] completely investigates
the application of the bundle algorithm, and [Luo et al., 1996a] suggests (ex-
act) penalty function methods and other procedures.
A global optimization algorithm for MPECs is the branch-and-bound
method in [Muu and Oettli, 2001].
As for bilevel problems, descent methods for MPECs aim at finding sta-
tionary solutions. A descent algorithm being based on sensitivity analysis for
the unique lower level solution is given in [Friesz et al., 1990]. Bundle algo-
rithms for the computation of Clarke-stationary points are developed in the
papers [Koc̆vara and Outrata, 1997], [Koc̆vara and Outrata, 1992], as well as
in the papers [Koc̆vara and Outrata, 1993], [Koc̆vara and Outrata, 1994a],
[Koc̆vara and Outrata, 1994b], [Outrata and Zowe, 1995]. An interior point
algorithm is developed in [Luo et al., 1996a]. Other algorithms compute
the stronger Bouligand-stationary points. These include trust region meth-
ods of [Marcotte et al., 2001], [Scholtes and Stöhr, 1999], smoothing meth-
ods using the Fischer-Burmeister function applied to the complementar-
12
ity condition in [Facchinei et al., 1999], [Fukushima et al., 1998], and in
[Fukushima and Pang, 1999], the path-following approach for MPECs in
[Scholtes, 2001], a penalty method in [Hu and Ralph, 2002a] and piece-
wise SQP methods [Jiang and Ralph, 2002], [Luo et al., 1998], [Ralph, 1996],
[Ralph, 2001]. The letter methods show superlinear convergence under ap-
propriate assumptions. Piecewise SQP methods for problems with lin-
ear complementarity constraints can be found in [Zhang and Liu, 2001].
A smooth penalization approach to MPECs converging under appropri-
ate assumptions to Bouligand stationary points is presented in [Hu, 2002],
[Hu and Ralph, 2002a], [Huang et al., 2001].
Penalty function methods for MPECs have been proposed in the papers
[Harker and Choi, 1991], [Luo et al., 1996b], [Mangasarian and Pang, 1997],
[Marcotte and Zhu, 1996], [Outrata, 2000b], [Scholtes and Stöhr, 1999], as
well as [Ye, 1998].
Many papers have been devoted to the question of how nonlinear pro-
gramming problems behave when applied to MPECs. A generally good be-
havior of many such algorithms is reported in [Fletcher and Leyffer, 2002].
The behavior of interior point algorithms is the topic of [Benson et al., 2002].
They identify possible difficulties of such algorithms and suggest remedies.
Smooth SQP methods have shown good behavior [Jiang and Ralph, 2000]
and they proved to be superior with respect to local convergence in
[Fletcher et al., 2002]. In [Anitescu, 2002] properties of MPECs have been
derived guaranteeing a good behavior of elastic mode SQP algorithms.
The possible convergence of a penalty interior point method to a nonsta-
tionary point for MPECs is reported in [Leyffer, 2002].
The ways to regularize possibly unsolvable MPECs have been investigated
in [Mangasarian, 1998].
For the generation of test examples with special properties or known so-
lutions see [Calamai and Vicente, 1993], [Calamai and Vicente, 1994a] and
the papers [Calamai and Vicente, 1994b], [Jiang and Ralph, 1999] as well
as [Moshirvaziri et al., 1996]. Test problems for bilevel programming are
contained in Chapter 9 of the book [Floudas et al., 1999]. A large list of
benchmark problems for MPECs can be found on Sven Leyffer’s home page,
presently under the URL

6 Theoretical results
In this section focus is on some theoretical aspects. Most of the papers
present also theoretical properties needed for the presented results. But the,
to the author’s opinion, an insightful and recommendable description of the
structural properties of mathematical programs with equilibrium problems
(which also carry over to bilevel problems) can be found in the monograph
[Luo et al., 1996a]. These include also the theoretical investigation of para-
metric variational inequalities and the implicit function approach to MPECs.
Genericity aspects correspond to the question if some property can
be assumed for real problems, i.e. if this property is satisfied for all-
most all problem instances. In the papers [Kenderov and Lucchetti, 1996],
[Lignola and Morgan, 2000], [Still, 2002] it is shown that bilevel program-
ming problems are generically well-posed and in [Scholtes and Stöhr, 2001]
it is verified that the generalized linear independence constraint qualification
is generically satisfied. Usual constraint qualifications of nonlinear program-
ming, as the linear independence and the Mangasarian-Fromowitz constraint
qualifications, are violated at all feasible points of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
reformulation of a bilevel programming problem [Scheel and Scholtes, 2000],
the same has been shown for linear problems in [Chen and Florian, 1995].
But the weaker partial calmness condition can be satisfied [Yang, 1999]. Re-
lated is the sensitivity analysis of linear bilevel programming [Jia et al., 1998]
and the behavior of solutions under perturbations in the case when the lower
level optimal solution is unique [Loridan and Morgan, 1989b]. Sensitivity
analysis for MPECs with right-hand perturbations using Mordukhovich’s
coderivative has been done in [Lucet and Ye, 2001]. More sensitivity results
for MPECs can be found in [Hu and Ralph, 2002b],[Lucet and Ye, 2001],
[Scheel and Scholtes, 2000].
The stucture of MPECs is highlighted in [Luo et al., 1996a] and that of
the feasible set in three- and multi-level linear problems in [Bard, 1984a],
[Benson, 1989]. The problems with multiple leaders is addressed in
[Sherali, 1984]. A surprising result is the dependence of bilevel mathemati-
cal problems on irrelevant constraints [Macal and Hurter, 1997]. This means
that dropping some lower level constraints which are not active at an optimal
solution (x∗, y∗) of the bilevel programming problem can change the problem
drastically such that (x∗, y∗) will not remain optimal.
The existence of a vertex optimal solution has been verified for the
linear problem [Bard, 1984b], for quasiconcave bilevel optimization prob-
14
lems [Calvete and Gale, 1998], for problems with quadratic lower level prob-
lem [Frangioni, 1995], for problems with fractional lower level problems
[Calvete and Galé, 1999], and for problems with bottleneck objective func-
tions [Mathur and Puri, 1994], [Mathur and Puri, 1995]. Equivalence be-
tween solvability, existence of exact penalty functions and the existence of
an optimal vertex for linear bilevel programming problems has been shown
in [Xu, 1999].
For bilevel programming problems with non-unique lower level optimal
solution it is important to investigate the question of how to define a solu-
tion [Dempe, 1993b]. Related are postoptimal considerations to find Pareto-
optimal solutions of a corresponding bicriteria programming problem close
to an optimal solution of the bilevel programming problem [Soismaa, 1999],
[Wen and Hsu, 1992], [Wen and Lin, 1996].
Also the significance of the order of the play [Bard and Falk, 1982] and
the question if the leader’s or the follower’s position is the better one
[Tovey, 1991] have been investigated.
The existence of feasible solutions for MPECs with additional joint con-
straints has been the topic of [Fukushima and Pang, 1998].
Basic properties of discrete bilevel programming problems can be found
in [Vicente et al., 1996].
For set-valued optimization problems, Fenchel duality [Lai et al., 1983],
[Song, 1998b] and well-posedness [Huang, 2001] have been investigated. Su-
per efficiency for set-valued vector optimization problems is discussed in
the papers [Gong, 1996], [Li and Wang, 1998], [Rong and Wu, 1998] and
[Wen, 1997]. The existence of optimal solutions for such problems is shown
in [Chen and Huang, 1998].
7 Applications
Applications have been a stimulating factor for the development of bilevel
programming and mathematical problems with equilibrium constraints. The
number of papers presenting applications is growing rapidly. We present
applications without reference to either bilevel programming or mathematical
programs with equilibrium constraints.
Interesting applications of MPECs to engineering and economical prob-
lems are contained in [Outrata et al., 1998], an overview of applications of
bilevel programming is given in [Marcotte and Savard, 2001].
15
Applications in economics include the investigation of networks of
oligopolies in [Abou-Kandil and Bertrand, 1987], [Leleno and Sherali, 1992],
hierarchical structures of multidivisional organizations have been discussed
in [Bard, 1983b], [Cassidy et al., 1971], [Kistner and Switalski, 1989] and in
the papers [Kononenko and Chumakov, 1988], [Sherali et al., 1983]. Focus
is on resource allocation problems in the papers [Ereshko and Zlobin, 1977],
[Önal et al., 1995], [Sagyngaliev, 1985a], [Sagyngaliev, 1985b], as well as in
[Sagyngaliev, 1986a], [Sagyngaliev, 1986b], [Wang and Lootsma, 1994].
Principal agency theory has been considered in a number of papers, in-
cluding [Balachandran and Ronen, 1989], [Bracken and McGill, 1978], and
[Dempe, 1995], [Grossman and Hart, 1983], [Kiener, 1990]. These prob-
lems are highlighted from a more economical point-of-view in the pa-
pers [Laux and Schenk-Mathes, 1992], [Petersen, 1989], [Rees, 1985a], and
[Rees, 1985b], [Ross, 1973], [Sinclair-Desagne, 1994].
Interesting applications are the determination of optimal prices, as road
tolls or prices for electricity [Brotcorne et al., 2000], [Labbè et al., 1998],
[Labbé et al., 1998], and [Lavigne et al., 200], [Luh et al., 1987], as well as
[Yan and Lam, 1996]. Related are the determination of optimal tax credits
for biofuel production in the papers [Bard et al., 1998], [Bard et al., 2000],
and [Dempe and Bard, 2001], and the optimal penalization of too large or
too small amounts of transported gas in [Dempe and Kalashnikov, 2002],
[Kalashnikov and Rios-Mercado, 2002a].
The aluminium production process has been analyzed in [Nicholls, 1995],
[Nicholls, 1996], [Nicholls, 1997], and agricultural planning problems in
[Candler et al., 1981]. Also a facility location problem [Miller et al., 1992],
optimal software release policies [Zeephongsekul, 1996] and defense problems
[Bracken and McGill, 1974a] have been investigated.
A second large field of applications is in ecological problems. Here
the problem of an optimal percentage of repaired products has been in-
vestigated in [Dempe, 1996a]; the question of subsidy options to reduce
greenhouse-gas emissions [Hibino et al., 1996] or pollution control policies
[Amouzegar and Moshirvaziri, 1999] have been addressed topics. The dis-
posal of hazardous waste is the topic of [Amouzegar and Jacobsen, 1998].
Also electric utility demand-side planning [Hobbs and Nelson, 1992] belongs
to this area.
Some applied problems are concerned with water networks as e.g. the
problems in [Anandalingam and Apprey, 1991] and the surface and ground
water related planning policies in [Bisschop et al., 1982]. In the PhD the-
16
sis [Deuerlein, 2002] bilevel programming problems have been suggested for
tuning water networks. The analysis of transmission networks has been done
in [Berry et al., 1999], [Hobbs et al., 2000] .
A further field are the inverse problems where, given a point x∗ val-
ues of the parameters of a variational inequality [Tin-Loi and Que, 2001],
[Scholtes, 1999] or an optimization problem [Levitin, 1995a], [Levitin, 1995b]
are looked for such that x∗ is a solution of the resulting problem for that pa-
rameter. A related problem is the optimization over the efficient set of a
multiobjective optimization problem [Tu, 2000].
Many applications can be found within the optimization of transportation
planning and the (re-)construction of transportation networks, including the
highway design problem [Ben-Ayed et al., 1992], [Ben-Ayed et al., 1988] and
the network design problem in various papers, see [Current and Pirkul, 1991],
[Friesz et al., 1987], [Leblanc and Boyce, 1986], [Marcotte, 1986], as well
as [Suh and Kim, 1992], [Suwansirikul et al., 1987], [Zhang and Zhu, 1996].
Other transportation problems can be found in the papers [Ben-Ayed, 1990],
[Chen and Florian, 1998], [Kim and Suh, 1988], [Migdalas, 1995a], and in
[Patriksson and Rockafellar, 2001], [Yang and Bell, 2001].
Engineering applications can be found in [Ferris and Tin-Loi, 1999],
[Ferris and Tin-Loi, 2001], [Herskovits et al., 1998], [Herskovits et al., 2000],
[Kaneko, 1982], [Panagiotopoulos et al., 1998]. For more applications in
this field see [Stavroulakis, 1995], [Stavroulakis and Günzel, 1998]. The re-
lated optimal structural design problem has been investigated in the paper
[Christiansen et al., 1998], and a multiload truss topology design problem in
[Ben-Tal and Nemirovskii, 1994].
At a first glance more inner mathematical problems belong to game
theory [Ehtamo and Raivio, 2001] and to the discrimination of point sets
[Mangasarian, 1994, Marcotte and Savard, 1992].
Bilevel programming problems and MPECs have been used to solve other
problems as optimal control problems [Edmunds and Bard, 1990] and gener-
alized semi-infinite optimization problems [Stein and Still, 2001].
