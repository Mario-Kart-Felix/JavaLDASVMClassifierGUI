‘What’ and ‘How’ of Optimization 
• Optimization helps businesses make better decisions faster through TLC+D 
 
• Achieve Targets 
– All decisions are not equal. Measurable targets allow you to rank alternative decisions. 
 
• Enforce Limits 
– Not all decisions are acceptable. Some limits must be enforced. 
 
• Make Choices 
– Decisions must be made; however there are many ways to make them. 
 
• Based on Data 
– Required to measure targets, establish limits and understand relationships

“By building a unique technology solution for our securities services, we now 
better serve the Mexican Financial Community and trading partners.  We are 
very proud that this solution has played a key role in helping elevate the 
economy of Mexico.” 
Jaime Villaseñor 
Chief Risk Officer, INDEVAL 
Indeval was looking for a solution to 
process security transactions in real 
time, rather than on a daily basis, to 
provide the best service to the Mexican 
Stock Exchange and be more cost 
effective for trading partners.  
The need 
Indeval (Mexican Central Securities Depository) 
What Makes It Smarter 
 By integrating a more robust platform, Indeval is completely transforming the 
way it serves the stock exchange trading brokers and the way the Mexican 
Financial Community used to operate, taking the trading activity in the country 
to a new level. Trading operations are now being reconciled and completed 
faster and more efficiently, increasing the number of operations the 
organization can perform each day and lowering the liquidity requirements of 
traders.  With immediate data on market fluctuations and movements, investors 
are armed with the right intelligence to make informed decisions and react the 
moment changes occur instead of a day later. Thanks to the new system, 
Mexican economic performance has improved, reducing its “Country Risk” 
factor qualification among worldwide financial analysts.   
Business Results 
– Real time reconciliation and completion of trading operations for more than 
USD$250 B in average, every day 
– Reduced liquidity requirements for trading partners by 52 percent 
– Increased the volume of operations by 26 percent  
– Reduced the costs of each trading transaction for electronic trading facilities, 
the Stock Exchange and trading brokers 
– Enhanced Mexico’s risk status among analysts  
Solution Components 
A private securities depository organization in Mexico implements a customized solution to reconcile and complete trading

Success Story – Unit Commitment at REE  
The methodology applied until now … 
was an interactive methodology, which 
did not guarantee an optimum solution. 
There were many difficulties in the 
smaller systems and it was hard to find 
the most viable solution. Thanks to the 
new methodology, we have resolved this 
type of problem. 
- Mr. Mustafa Pezic, REE Project Director 
Business Problem – Use exact mathematical methods to replace the 
approximate, heuristic methods Red Eléctrica de España, in charge of 
managing the Spanish national power grid, had been using for the last 20 years

IBM Research – Business Analytics and Mathematical Sciences 
Benefits for REE 
• The implementation of OPL/CPLEX and ODM solution has provided 
great operational advantages to company’s managers and 
engineers 
– “The new tool allows us to simplify all maintenance tasks and any changes 
made to the model, which in our particular case, are very frequent.”  
– “From a user viewpoint, it has brought greater trust in the solution and a 
significant reduction in planning time required by users. In parallel with this, from 
a development and maintenance viewpoint, there has been a significant 
reduction in associated costs, as well as in the duration of the processes.”  
 
• The bottom line:  
– REE reduced production costs by between €50,000 and €100,000 per day.  
– REE has reduced its carbon emissions by approximately 100,000 tons of CO2 
annually.

Rolling Stock Allocation at Netherlands Railways 
• Situation 
– Precisely matching trains and their cars to expected user traffic is crucial for a railway to keep costs down 
and service on time.  
– Netherlands Railways transports more than 1 million passengers a day in its own country, works with 
partners in Germany, Belgium and France, and a subsidiary in Great Britain that carries more than 300,000 
passengers daily.  
– Netherlands Railways’ more than 5,000 trains get passengers where they want to go in the Netherlands 
through a network of 390 stations and 2,800 kilometers of track.

Results of Analysis for CPG manufacturer 
• Regional Sourcing 
– Open new plants in SE Asia and Russia to serve regional markets, as well as expansion at specific plants 
– Identified specific cross-regional sourcing opportunities (Asia-Pacific to Europe) 
• Co-manufacturing

– Once new plants are built co-manufacturing sourcing should be reduced to negligible amounts due to lower cost of in-house 
production 
• Plant Closure Evaluation 
– Recommended closure of specific plants; Labor cost savings outweighed freight & duty cost savings for selected plants. 
• Capital Planning 
– Developed a detailed capital plan outlining equipment requirements by year over 10 horizon to support demand growth.
