Introduction to Mathematical 
Optimization
• Prerequisites
• Information and Vocabulary
• Course Outline
Course prerequisites
• First three units: math content around Algebra 1 
level, analytical skills approaching Calculus. 
Students at the Pre-Calculus level should feel 
comfortable. Talented students in Algebra 1 can 
certainly give it a shot.
• Last two units: Calculus required – know how to 
take derivatives and be familiar with their 
implications for finding maxima and minima.
• Computer programming skills will be taught from 
the ground up. Previous experience is not 
necessary. 
Equipment Needed
For much of the first unit, a scientific calculator 
is sufficient, though a graphing calculator will 
make your life easier.
Towards the end of the first unit, when we get 
into coding, a computer able to download and 
install software (specifically, the programming 
language Julia) is necessary. Julia is written for 
Mac, Windows and Linux systems.
So… what is mathematical 
optimization, anyway?
“Optimization” comes from the same root as 
“optimal”, which means best. When you 
optimize something, you are “making it best”.

“Optimization” comes from the same root as 
“optimal”, which means best. When you 
optimize something, you are “making it best”.  
But “best” can vary. If you’re a football player, 
you might want to maximize your running 
yards, and also minimize your fumbles. Both 
maximizing and minimizing are types of 
optimization problems. 
Mathematical Optimization in the 
“Real World”
Mathematical Optimization is a branch of 
applied mathematics which is useful in many 
different fields. Here are a few examples:

Optimization Vocabulary
Your basic optimization problem consists of…
• The objective function, f(x), which is the output 
you’re trying to maximize or minimize.

• Variables, x1 x2 x3 and so on, which are the inputs –
things you can control. They are abbreviated xn to 
refer to individuals or x to refer to them as a group.

on how big or small some variables can get. 
Equality constraints are usually noted hn(x) and 
inequality constraints are noted gn(x).
Optimization Vocabulary
A football coach is planning practices for his running backs. 
• His main goal is to maximize running yards – this will 
become his objective function. 
• He can make his athletes spend practice time in the weight 
room; running sprints; or practicing ball protection. The 
amount of time spent on each is a variable. 
• However, there are limits to the total amount of time he 
has. Also, if he completely sacrifices ball protection he may 
see running yards go up, but also fumbles, so he may place 
an upper limit on the amount of fumbles he considers 
acceptable. These are constraints.
Note that the variables influence the objective function and 
the constraints place limits on the domain of the variables.

not.

Why Mathematical Optimization is  
Important
• Mathematical Optimization works better than 
traditional “guess-and-check” methods
• M. O. is a lot less expensive than building and 
testing
• In the modern world, pennies matter, 
microseconds matter, microns matter.

Why Mathematical Optimization is 
worth learning
Joking aside, if you’re interested in a career in 
mathematics (outside of teaching or academia), 
your best bet is applied mathematics with 
computers. Mathematical optimization is a 
powerful career option within applied math.
If you’re not interested in a career in 
mathematics, you will probably run into 
optimization problems anyway.

Practice Question 1
Group the following into what might be maximized, 
minimized or cannot be optimized.
1. When choosing a new phone and plan, you might 
consider: minutes of talk time per month; how 
much is charged for overages; whether extra 
minutes roll over; amount of data allowed; cost per 
month; amount of storage/memory; how many 
phones are available; brands/types of available 
phones; cost of the phone; amount of energy used; 
time it takes to download apps or music; whether or 
not you get signal in your home.
Practice Question 2
2. An airplane designer is trying to build the 
most fuel-efficient airplane possible. Write one 
factor as an objective (“Minimize/maximize 
_____”) and the rest as constraints ( “_____ ≤ 
c1”, or ≥ or =). Delete any non-numerical factors:
speed, fuel consumption, range, noise, weight, 
type of propulsion, cost, ease of use, amount of 
lift, amount of drag, sonic boom volume, 
payload (how much it can carry).
Practice Questions 3-5
For each of the following tasks, write an objective 
function (“maximize ____”) and at least two 
constraints (“subject to _____ ≤ c1”, or ≥ or =)
3. A student must create a poster project for a 
class.
4. A shipping company must deliver packages to 
customers.
5. A grocery store must decide how to organize 
the store layout.
