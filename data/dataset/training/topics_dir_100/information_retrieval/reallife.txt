Abstract
We analyzed transaction logs containing 51,473 queries posed by 18,113 users of Excite, a major
Internet search service. We provide data on: (i) sessions Ð changes in queries during a session, number
of pages viewed, and use of relevance feedback; (ii) queries Ð the number of search terms, and the use
of logic and modi®ers; and (iii) terms Ð their rank/frequency distribution and the most highly used
search terms. We then shift the focus of analysis from the query to the user to gain insight to the
characteristics of the Web user. With these characteristics as a basis, we then conducted a failure
analysis, identifying trends among user mistakes. We conclude with a summary of ®ndings and a
discussion of the implications of these ®ndings. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
1. Introduction
A panel session at the 1997 ACM Special Interest Group on Research Issues In Information
Retrieval conference entitled ``Real Life Information Retrieval: Commercial Search Engines''
included representatives from several Internet search services. Doug Cutting represented Excite,
one of the major services. Graciously, he oered to make available a set of user queries as
submitted to his service for research. The analysis we present here on the nature of sessions,
queries, and terms resulted from this oer. Interestingly, the ®rst two authors expressed their

interest independently of each other, then met via email, exchanged messages and data, and
conducted collaborative research exclusively through the Internet, before ever meeting in
person at a Rutgers conference in February 1998, when the results were ®rst presented. In
itself, this is an example of how the Internet changed and is changing the conduct of research.
We will argue in the conclusions that real life Internet searching is changing information
retrieval (IR) as well. While Internet search engines are based on IR principles, Internet
searching is very dierent from IR searching as traditionally practised and researched in online
databases, CD-ROMs and online public access catalogs (OPACS). Internet IR is a dierent
IR, with a number of implications that could portend changes in other areas of IR as well.
With the phenomenal increase in usage of the Web, there has been a growing interest in the
study of a variety of topics and issues related to use of the Web. For instance, on the hardware
side, Crovella and Bestavros (1996) studied client-side trac; and Abdulla, Fox and Abrams,
(1997) analyzed server usage. On the software side, there have been many descriptive
evaluations of Web search engines (e.g. Lynch, 1997). Statistics of Web use appear regularly
(e.g. Kehoe, Pitkow & Morton, 1997; FIND/SVP, 1997), but as soon as they appear, they are
out of date. The coverage of various Web search engine services was analyzed in several works.
A recent article on this topic by Lawrence and Giles (1998) attracted a lot of attention. The
pattern of Web sur®ng by users was analyzed as well (Huberman, Pirolli, Pitkow & Lukose,
1998). However, to date there has been no large-scale, quantitative or qualitative study of Web
searching.
How do they search the Web? What do they search for on the Web? These questions are
addressed in a large scale and academic manner in this study. Given the recent yearly
exponential increase in the estimated number of Web users, this lack of scholarly research is
surprising and disappointing. In contrast, there have been an abundance of user studies of on-
line public access categories (OPAC) users. Many of these studies are reviewed in Peters (1993).
Similarly, there are numerous studies of users of traditional IR systems. The combined
proceedings of the International Conference on Research Issues in Information Retrieval
(ACM SIGIR) present many of these studies.
In the area of Web users, however, there were only two narrow studies that we could ®nd.
One focused on the THOMAS system (Croft, Cook & Wilder, 1995) and contained some
general information about users at that site. However, this study focused exclusively on the
THOMAS Web site, did not attempt to characterize Web searching in a systematic way, and is
devoted primarily to a description of the THOMAS system. The second paper was by Jones,
Cunningham and McNab (1998) and focused again on a single Web site, the New Zealand
Digital Library, which contains computer science technical reports. Given the technical nature
of this site, it is questionable whether these users represent Web users in general. There is a
small but growing body of Web user studies compared to the numerous studies of OPAC and
IR system use.
In this paper, we report results from a major and ongoing study of users' searching behavior
on the Web. We examined a set of transaction logs of users' searches from Excite (http://
www.excite.com). This study involved real users, using real queries, with real information
needs, using a real search engine. The strength of this study is that it involved a real slice of
life on the Web. The weakness is that it involved only a slice Ð an observable artifact of what
the users actually did, without any information about the users themselves or about the results
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227208
and uses. Users are anonymous, but we can identify one or a sequence of queries originating
with a speci®c user. We know when they searched and what they searched for, but we do not
know anything beyond that. We report on artifactual behavior, but without a context.
However, the observation and analysis of such behavior provide for a fascinating and
surprising insight into the interaction between users and the search engines on the Web. More
importantly, this study provides detailed statistics currently lacking on Web user behavior. It
also provides a basis for comparison with similar studies of user searching of more traditional
IR and OPAC systems.
The Web has a number of search engines. The approaches to searching, including
algorithms, displays, modes of interaction and so on, vary from one search engine to another.
Still, all Web search engines are IR tools for searching highly diverse and distributed
information resources as found on the Web. But by the nature of the Web resources, they are
faced with dierent issues requiring dierent solutions than the search engines found in well
organized systems, such as in DIALOG, or in lab experiments, such as in the Text Retrieval
Conference (TREC) (Sparck Jones, 1995). Moreover, from all that we know, Web users span a
vastly broader and thus probably dierent population of users (Spink, Bateman & Jansen,
1999) and information needs, which may greatly aect the queries, searches, and interactions.
Thus, it is of considerable interest to examine the similarities and/or dierences in Web
searching compared to traditional IR systems. In either case, it is potentially a very dierent
IR.
The signi®cance of this study is the same as all other related studies of IR interaction,
queries and searching. By axiom and from lessons learned from experience and numerous
studies:
``The success or failure of any interactive system and technology is contingent on the extent
to which user issues, the human factors, are addressed right from the beginning to the very
end, right from theory, conceptualization, and design process to development, evaluation, and
to provision of services'' (Saracevic, 1997).
2. Related IR studies
In this paper, we concentrate on users' sessions, queries, and terms as key variables in IR
interaction on the Web. While there are many papers that discuss many aspects of Web
searching, most of those are descriptive, prescriptive, or commentary. Other than the two
mentioned previously, we could not ®nd any similar studies of Web searching. However, there
were several studies that included data on searching of existing, mostly commercial, IR
systems, and we culled data from those to provide a basis for comparison between searches as
done on the Web and those as done on IR systems outside the Web. A representative sample
of such studies is reviewed.
The studies cited below concentrated on dierent aspects and variables related to searching,
using dierent methodologies and are dicult to compare. Still, each of them had data on the
mean number of search terms in queries constructed by the searchers under study as follows:
. Fenichel (1981): Novice searchers: 7.9. Moderately experienced: 9.6. Experienced: 14.4
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227 209
. Hsieh-yee (1993): Familiar topics: Novices: 8.77. Experienced: 7.28. Non-familiar topics:
Novices: 9.67. Experienced: 9.00
. Bates, Wilde and Siegfried (1993): Humanities scholars: 14.95
. Spink and Saracevic (1997): Experienced searchers: 14.8.
The studies indicated that searches by various populations contain a range of some 7±15 terms.
As will be discussed below, this is a considerably higher range than the mean number of terms
found in this study that concentrated on Web searches from the Excite search engine.
3. Background on Excite and data
Founded in 1994, Excite Inc. is a major Internet media public company which oers free
Web searching and a variety of other services. The company and its services are described at
its Web site (http://www.excite.com), thus not repeated here. Only the search capabilities
relevant to out results are summarized.
Excite searches are based on the exact terms that a user enters in the query, however,
capitalization is disregarded, with the exception of logical commands AND, OR, and AND
NOT. Stemming is not available. An online thesaurus and concept linking method called
Intelligent Concept Extraction (ICE) is used, to ®nd related terms in addition to terms entered.
Search results are provided in ranked relevance order. A number of advanced search features
are available. Those that pertain to our results are described here:
. As to search logic, Boolean operators AND, OR, AND NOT, and parentheses can be used,
but these operators must appear in ALL CAPS and with a space on each side. When using
Boolean operator ICE (concept-based search mechanism) is turned o.
. A set of terms enclosed in quotation marks (no space between quotation marks and terms)
returns web sites with the terms as a phrase in the exact order they were entered.
. A + (plus) sign before a term (no space) requires that the term must be in an answer.
. A ÿ (minus) sign before a term (no space) requires that the term must NOT be in an
answer. We denote plus and minus signs, and quotation marks, as modi®ers.
. A page of search results contains ten answers at a time ranked as to relevance. For each site
provided is the title, URL (Web site address), and a summary of its contents. Results can
also be displayed by site and titles only. A user can click on the title to go to the Web site.
A user can also click for the next page of ten answers. In addition, there is a clickable
option More Like This, which is a relevance feedback mechanism to ®nd similar sites.
. When More Like This is clicked, Excite enters and counts this as a query with zero terms.
Each transaction record contained three ®elds. With these three ®elds, we were able to locate a
user's initial query and recreate the chronological series of actions by each user in a session:
1. Time of Day: measured in hours, minutes, and seconds from midnight of 9 March 1997.
2. User Identi®cation: an anonymous user code assigned by the Excite server.
3. Query Terms: exactly as entered by the given user.
Focusing on our three levels of analysis Ð sessions, queries, and terms Ð we de®ned our
variables in the following way.
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227210
1. Session: A session is the entire series of queries by a user over a number of minutes or
hours. A session could be as short as one query or contain many queries.
2. Query: A query consists of one or more search terms, and possibly includes logical
operators and modi®ers.
3. Term: A term is any unbroken string of characters (i.e. a series of characters with no space
between any of the characters). The characters in terms included everything Ð letters,
numbers, and symbols. Terms were words, abbreviations, numbers, symbols, URLs, and any
combination thereof. We counted logical operators in capitals as terms. However, in a
separate analysis we isolated them as commands, not terms.
The raw data collected are very messy. Users entered terms, commands and modi®ers in all
kinds of ways, including many misspellings and mistakes. In many cases, Excite conventions
were not followed. We count these deviations as mistakes and report them in the failure
analysis portion of the paper. For the most part, we took the data `as is,' i.e., we did not
`clean' the data in any way Ð these queries represent real searches by real users. The only
normalization we undertook in one of the counts (unique terms Ð not case sensitive) was to
disregard capitalization, because Excite disregards it as well. (i.e. TOPIC, topic and Topic
retrieve the same answers). Excite does not oer automatic stemming, thus topic and topics
count as two unique terms, and `?' or `' as stemming commands at the end of terms are
mistakes, but when used counted as separate terms. We also analyzed a cleaned set of terms,
that is we removed term modi®ers such as the + or ÿ signs. We took great care in the
derivation of counts due to the `messiness' of data. This paper extends ®ndings from (Jansen,
Spink, Bateman & Saracevic, 1998a,b; Jansen, Spink & Saracevic, 1998c).
4. Results
First, what is the pattern of user queries? We looked at the number of queries by each
speci®c user and how successive queries diered from other queries by the same user. We
classi®ed the 51,474 queries as to unique, modi®ed, or identical as shown in Table 1.
A unique query was the ®rst query by a user (this represents the number of users). A
modi®ed query is a subsequent query in succession (second, third . . .) by the same user with
terms added to, removed from, or both added to and removed from the unique query. Unique
and modi®ed queries together represent those queries where the user did something with terms.
Identical queries are queries by the same user that are identical to the query preceding it. They

can come about in two ways. The ®rst possibility is that the user retyped the query. Studies
have shown that users often do this (Peters, 1993). The second possibility is that the query was
generated by Excite. When a user views the second and further pages (i.e., a page is a group of
10 results) of results from the same query, Excite provides another query, but a query that is
identical to the preceding one. Our analysis did not allow disambiguation of these two causes
of identical queries.
The unique plus modi®ed queries (where users actively entered or modi®ed terms) amounted
to 29,437 queries or 57% of all queries. If we assume that all identical queries were generated
as a request to view subsequent pages, then 43% of queries come as a result of a desire to view
more pages after the ®rst one. Modi®cations and viewing are further elaborated in the next two
tables.
4.1. Modi®cations
Some users used only one query in their session, others used a number of successive queries.
The average session, including all three query types, was 2.84 queries per session. This means
that a number of users went on to either modify their query, view subsequent results, or both.
The average session length, ignoring identical queries, was 1.6 queries per user. Table 2 lists the
number of queries per user.
This analysis includes only the 29,337 unique and modi®ed queries. We ignored the identical
queries because as stated above, it was impossible to interpret them meaningfully in this
context, in order to concentrate only on those queries where users themselves did something to
the queries. A substantial majority of users (67%) did not go beyond their ®rst and only query.

Query modi®cation was not a typical occurrence. This ®nding is contrary to experiences in
searching regular IR systems, where modi®cation of queries is much more common. Having
said this, however, 33% of the users did go beyond their ®rst query. Approximately 14% of
users had entered three or more queries. These percentages of 33% and 14% are not
insigni®cant proportions of system users. It suggests that a substantial percentage of Web users
do not ®t the stereotypical naõÈ ve Web user. These sub-populations of users should receive
further study. They could represent sub-populations of Web users with more experience or
higher motivation who perform query modi®cation on the Web.
We also examined how user modi®ed their queries. These results are display in Table 3.
Here we concentrate on the 11,247 queries that were modi®ed by either an increase or a
decrease in the number of terms from one user's query to that user's next query (i.e., successive
queries by the same user at time T and T+1). Zero change means that the user modi®ed one
or more terms in a query, but did not change the number of terms in the successive query.
Increase or decrease of one means that one term was added to or subtracted from the
preceding query. Percent is based on the number of queries in relation to all modi®ed (11,247)
queries.
We can see that users typically do not add or delete much in respect to the number of terms

in their successive queries. Modi®cations to queries are done in small increments, if at all. The
most common modi®cation is to change a term. This number is re¯ected in the queries with
zero (0) increase or decrease in terms. About one in every three queries that is modi®ed still had
the same number of terms as the preceding one. In the remaining 7338 successive queries where
terms were either added or subtracted about equal number had terms added as subtracted (52±
48%) Ð thus users go both ways in increasing and decreasing number of terms in queries.
About one in ®ve queries that is modi®ed has one more term than the preceding one, and about
one in six has one less term.
4.2. Viewing of results
Excite displays query results in groups of ten. Each time that a user accesses another group
of 10, which we term another page, an identical query is generated. We analyzed the number
of pages each user viewed and the percentage that this represented based on the total number
of users. The results are shown in Table 4.
The mean number of pages examined per user was 2.35. Most users, 58% of them, did not
access any results past the ®rst page. Were they so satis®ed with the results that they did not
need to view more? Were a few answers good enough? Is the precision that high? Are the users
after precision? Or did they just give up and get tired of viewing results? Using only
transaction logs, we cannot provide answers to these questions. But in any case, this result
combined with the small number of queries per session has interesting implications for recall
and may illustrate a need for high precision in Web IR algorithms. For example, using a
classical measurement of precision, any search result beyond the tenth position in the list
would be meaningless for 58% of Web users. Another possible interpretation is that people use
partially relevant items in the ®rst page to avoid further searching through subsequent pages.
Given the hypertext nature of the Web, partially relevant items (Spink, Greisdorf & Bateman,
1998) in the top ten maybe used as a jumping o point to ®nd relevant items. For example, a
user looking for a faculty member's homepage at a university does not retrieve the faculty's
homepage in the top ten but gets the university homepage. Rather than continue searching, the
user starts browsing, beginning with the university page.
4.3. Queries
From the session level of analysis, we then moved to the query level. The basic statistics
related to queries and search terms are given in Table 5.
We analyzed the queries based on length (i.e. number of terms), structure (use of Boolean
operators and modi®ers), and failure analysis (deviations from published rules of query
construction). We also identi®ed the number of users of Boolean logic and modi®ers.
4.3.1. Length
On the average, a query contained 2.21 terms. Table 6 shows the ranking of all queries by
number of terms.
Percent is the percentage of queries containing that number of terms relative to the total
number of queries. Web queries are short. About 62% of all queries contained one or two

terms. Fewer than 4% of the queries had more than 6 terms. As mentioned, we could not ®nd
any other data on Web searches from a major Web search engine, thus, the only comparisons
are with the two smaller studies by Croft et al. (1995) and Jones et al. (1998). The query length
observed in our research is similar to results from these two studies. This deviates signi®cantly
from traditional IR searching. As shown above, the mean number of search terms used in
searching of regular IR systems ranged from about 7 to 15. This is about three to seven times
higher than the mean number of times found in this study, and our count is on the high side,
because we counted operators as well. Admittedly, the circumstances and context between
searches done by users of IR systems such as DIALOG, and searches of the Web, done by the
general Internet population, may be vastly dierent. Thus this comparison may have little
meaning.
4.3.2. Relevance feedback
A note should be made on queries with zero terms (last row of Table 6). As mentioned,
when a user enters a command for relevance feedback (More Like This ), the Excite transaction
log counts that as a query, but a query with zero terms. Thus, the last row represents the
largest possible number of queries that used relevance feedback, or a combination of those and
queries where users made some mistake that triggered this result. Assuming they were all
relevance feedback, only 5% of queries used that feature Ð a small use of relevance feedback
capability. In comparison, a study involving IR searches conducted by professional searchers
as they interact with users found that some 11% of search terms came from relevance feedback
(Spink & Saracevic, 1997), albeit this study looked at human initiated relevance feedback.
Thus, in these two studies, relevance feedback on the Web is used half as much as in
traditional IR searches. This in itself warrants further study, particularly given the low use of
this potentially highly useful and certainly highly vaunted feature.
4.3.3. Structure
Next, we examined the structure of queries, focusing ®rst on how many of the 51,473 queries
explicitly utilized Boolean operators or modi®ers (see Table 7).
Table 6

The Number column lists the number of queries that contained that particular Boolean
operator or modi®er. The next column is the percentage that number represents of all queries.
Incorrect means the number of queries containing a speci®c operator or modi®er that was
constructed not following Excite rules Ð they could be considered as mistakes. The last
column is the percentage of queries containing a given operator or modi®er that were
incorrectly constructed. We discuss the failures in a later section.
From Table 7, at least one thing is obvious Ð Boolean operators were not used much, with
AND receiving the greatest use. These numbers were signi®cantly lower than those reported by
Jones et al. (1998), and signi®cantly lower than studies of searches from IR systems and OPAC
systems [Croft et al. (1995) did not report this information]. Modi®ers were used a little more
often, with the `+' and ``'' (i.e., phrase searching) being used the most. For example, based on
what we reviewed so far in this paper, we have a large set of queries that are extremely short,
seldom modi®ed, and very simple in structure. Yet, the vast majority of users never viewed
anything beyond the ®rst 10 results. Is the recall and precision rate of Excite that good? Is
something else at work here? One interpretation may be that users only glance at the ®rst page
to see how poorly they performed their search. Rather than taking time to learn the detailed
procedures of Excite, they try anything (trial and error) and then try to judge from the hits

4.3.4. Number of users
In Table 8, we examine how many of the 18,113 users, opposed to the number of queries,
used any Boolean logic (®rst four rows) or modi®ers (last three rows) in their queries
(regardless of how many queries they had).
We relate these numbers to the number of queries. Incorrect means the number of users
committing mistakes by not following Excite rules as stated in instructions for use of these
operators and modi®ers. Percent incorrect is the proportion of those users using a given
operator or modi®er incorrectly or as a mistake. The user population that incorporated
Boolean operators was very small. Only 6% of the 18,113 users used any of the Boolean
capabilities, and these were used in less than 10% of the 51,473 queries. A minuscule
percentage of users and queries used OR or AND NOT. Only about 1% of users and 12% of
queries used nested logic as expressed by a use of parentheses. The `+' and `ÿ' modi®ers were
used by about the same number of people that used Boolean operators. Together `+' and `ÿ'
were used by 1334 or 7% of users in 4776 (9%) queries. The ability to create phrases (terms
enclosed by quotation marks) was also seldom used Ð only 6% of users and 6% of queries
used them. From this, it appears that a small number of users account for the occurrences of
the more sophisticated queries, indicating that there is little experimentation by users during
their sessions. About 5% of the users account for the 8.5% of queries that contained Boolean
operators. We discuss the rami®cations of this ®nding for system design later in the paper.
5. Failure analysis
Next, we turn to a discussion of the surprisingly high number of incorrect uses or mistakes.
When they used it, 50% of users made a mistake in the use of the Boolean AND; 28% made
an error in uses of OR, and only 19% used AND NOT incorrectly, but only 47 users, a
negligible percent, used AND NOT at all. The most common mistake was not capitalizing the
Boolean operator, as required by the Excite search engine. For example, a correct query would
be: information AND processing. The most common mistake would be: information and
processing.
When we look at queries, 32% contained an incorrect use of AND, 26% of OR, and 37%
of AND NOT. `AND' presents a special problem, so we did a further analysis. We had 4094
queries that used AND in some form (as `AND,' ``And, or `and'). Some queries had more than
one AND. Altogether, there were 4828 appearances of all forms of AND: 3067 as `AND', 41
as `And,' and 1720 as `and.' If considered as Boolean operators, the last two or 1761 instances
were mistakes. Most of them were, but not all. In a number of queries `and' was used as
conjunction e.g. as in query College and university harassment policy. Unfortunately, we could
not distinguish the intended use of `and' as a conjunction from that as a mistake, thus our
count of AND mistakes is on the high end.
There was a similarly high percentage of mistakes in the use of plus and minus operators Ð
respectively 30% and 38%. Most of the time, spaces were used incorrectly. Minus presents an
especially vexing problem, because it is also used in phrases such as pre-teen. Thus, our count
of mistakes is at the high end. It is easy to see that Web users are not up to Boolean, and even
less to follow searching rules. At the very least, system redesign seems to be in order. The most
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227218
common mistake was stringing all the terms of the query together, as in a mathematical
formula. For example, a correct query would be: +information +processing. The most
common mistake would be: +information+processing (with no space between information
and the next +). Consistent spacing rules between Boolean operators and term modi®er may
solve this problem. In the use of Boolean operator, a space between the operator and the term
is required. With the use of term modi®ers, the space must not be there.
There were also a large number of queries that incorporated searching techniques that Excite
does not support. These failures can be classi®ed as a carry over from user learning associated
with other search engines, including those from other Web, OPAC, and IR systems. For
example, there were 26 occurrences of the proximity operator NEAR. There were 79 uses of
the `:' as a separator for terms. There were numerous occurrences of `.' used as a term
separator. The symbol `&' was used in-lieu of the Boolean AND over 200 times. These
symbols are common in many other search engines.
6. Terms
We also analyzed user queries according to the terms they included. A term was any series
of characters bounded by white space. There were 113,793 terms (all terms from all queries).
After eliminating duplicate terms, there were 21,862 unique terms that were non-case sensitive
(in other words, all upper cases are here reduced to lower case). In this distribution logical
operators AND, OR, NOT were also treated as terms, because they were used not only as
operators but also as conjunctions (we already discussed the case of `and.' and presented the
®gures for various forms of the term, thus subtraction can be easily done). We discuss terms
from the perspective of their occurrence, their ®t with known distributions, and classi®cation
into some broader subject headings.
6.1. Occurrences
We constructed a complete rank-frequency table for all 113,793 terms. Out of the complete
rank-frequency-table we took the top terms, i.e. those that appeared 100 times or more, as
presented in Table 9.
The 74 terms that were used 100 or more times across all queries appeared a total of 20,698
times as search terms. They represent only 0.34% of all unique terms, yet they account for
18.2% of all 113,776 search terms in all queries. If we delete the 9121 occurrences of 11
common terms that do not carry any content by themselves (and, of, the, in, for, +, on, to, or,
&, a), we are left with 63 subject terms that have a total frequency of 11,577 occurrences Ð
that is 0.29% of unique subject terms account for 10.3% of all terms in all queries. The high
appearance of `+' represents a probable mistake Ð the inclusion of space between the sign
and a term, as required by Excite rules.
Similarly, `&'' was used often as a part of an abbreviation, such as in AT&T, but also as a
substitute for logical AND, as in Ontario & map. In the latter case, it is a mistake and would
appear as a separate term. On the other end of the distribution we have 9790 terms that
appeared only once. These terms amounted to 44.78% of all unique terms and 8.6% of all
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227 219
terms in all queries. The tail end of unique terms is very long and warrants in itself a linguistic
investigation. In fact, the whole area of query language needs further investigation. There are
no comprehensive studies of terms, the distribution of those terms, the modi®cation of those
terms, etc., of Web queries. Such studies have potential to bene®t IR system and Web site
development.
6.2. Term categories
In order to ascertain some broad subjects of searching, we classi®ed the 63 top subject terms
into a set of common themes. Admittedly, such a classi®cation is arbitrary and each reader can
use his/her own criteria. Still a rough picture emerges. These subjects are displayed in Table 10.
About 25% of the highest used terms apparently dealt with some or other sexual topic.
However, that represents fewer than 3% of all terms. Of course, if one classi®es additional
terms further down the distribution (such as those listed in the ``Gender'' category as Sexual )
the percent will be higher. We perused the rest of the terms and came to the conclusion than
no more than some two dozen of the other terms will unmistakably fall into that category. If
we added them all together, the frequency of terms in Sexual will increase but not that much,

and particularly not in relation to thousands of terms in other categories that are widely spread
across all frequencies. In other words, as to frequency of appearance of terms among the 63
highest frequency terms, those in category Sexual have the highest frequency of all categories,
but still three out of every four terms of the 63 highest frequency terms are not sexual; if
extended to the frequency of use of all terms we estimate that 39 out of 40 of all terms were
not sexual.
While the category Sexual is certainly big, in comparison to all other categories in no way
does it dominate searching. Interest in other categories is high. Of the 63 highest terms, 16%
are modi®ers (free, new, big . . . ), 10% deal with places (state, american . . . ), 8% with
economics (employment, jobs . . .), and the rest with social activities, education, sports,
computing, and arts. In other words, Web searching does cover a gamut of human interests. It
is very diverse. In light of this, the stereotypical view of the Web user searching primarily for
sexual information may not be valid.
There are two other groupings not listed in the table that should be noted. First, there were
1398 queries for various uniform resource locators (URL). Although no one URL made the
top of the list, if lumped together as a category, it was one of, if not the largest query category.
The second group was searching for multimedia documents (e.g. images, videos, and audio
®les). There were 708 queries for these multimedia ®les, with many of these terms looking for
speci®c formats.
6.3. Distribution of terms
We constructed a graph of rank±frequency distribution of all terms. This graph is shown in
Fig. 1.
The resulting distribution seems to be unbalanced at the ends of the graph, the high and low
ranking terms. In the center and lower regions, the graph follows the traditional slope of a
Zipf distribution representing the distribution of words in long English texts. At the beginning,
it falls o very gently, and toward the end it shows discontinuities and an unusually long tail,
representing terms with a frequency of one. A trend line is plotted on the ®gure with the
corresponding equation. The trend line is approximately that of the Zipf distribution. A proper
Zipf distribution would be a straight line with slope of ÿ1. The trend line does not plot well
for the higher frequency terms due to the large number of terms occurring only once or twice.
We wondered if the number of modi®ers (e.g. `+', `ÿ', ``, etc.) and the number of queries
with all terms strung together (e.g. +information+processing+journal) could be aecting the
rank±frequency distribution, that is, if the number of modi®ers, stray characters, and run-on
terms, were creating such a long tail of single occurrence terms. Therefore, we decided to clean
all terms and re-plot the rank±frequency graph. In cleaning terms, we removed all modi®ers
and separated all terms that were obviously strung together. Due to the varying nature of the
terms, this could not be done automatically. For example, one could not just remove `+' from
all terms because, for example, with c++ (the programming language), the `+' is part of a
valid term. In the cleaning process, all 113,793 terms were qualitatively examined. In most
cases, a decision would clearly be made on whether or not to clean the term. In cases were
there was doubt, the term was not modi®ed. Once clean, we again generated a rank±frequency
(log) plot. This rank±frequency plot is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Rank (log) vs frequency (log) of cleaned terms.
B.J. Jansen et al. / Information Processing and Management 36 (2000) 207±227 223
Overall, the graph exhibits the same characteristics as before, a few terms o the scale, a
fairly broad middle, ending with of several plateaus: and a long tail of terms used only one
time. The only noticeable change is in the length of the plateaus, some are shorter and some
are longer. The trend line again is approximately that of the Zipf distribution, with only a
slight increase in slope. Again, the tails of the graph in no way resemble a Zipf distribution.
This warrants further study of the ends of the rank±frequency distribution. Also, for
researchers, this shows that there is little bene®t in expending the energy to clean terms, as the
change in the distribution is slight. A comparison of the original and the cleaned data appears
in Table 11.
Fig. 3 is the original and cleaned rank±frequency (log) plots overlaid along with the trend
lines.
6.4. Summary of results
The analysis involved 51,473 queries from 18,113 users, having all together 113,776 terms, of
which 21,862 were unique terms (disregarding capitalization). We provide the highlights of our
®ndings:
. Most users did not have many queries per search. The mean number of queries per user was
2.8. However, a sizable percentage of users did go on to either modify their original query or
view subsequent results.
. Web queries are short. On the average, a query contained 2.21 terms. Queries used in
searching regular IR systems are some three to seven times larger. About one in three
queries had one term only, two in three had one or two terms, and four in ®ve had one, two
or three terms. Fewer than 4% of the queries were comprised of more than 6 terms.
. Relevance feedback was rarely used. About one in 20 queries used the feature More Like
This. In comparison with professionally assisted IR searching, relevance feedback is
apparently used only half as much on the Web.
. Boolean operators were seldom used. One in 18 users used any Boolean capabilities, and of
the users employing them, every second user made a mistake, as de®ned by Excite rules. As
to the queries, about one in 12 queries contained a Boolean operator, and in those AND
was used by far the most. About one in 190 queries used nested logic. About one in every
three queries that used Boolean operators or a parentheses did not enter them as required by
Excite. Web searchers are reluctant to use Boolean searches and when using them they have
great diculty in getting them right.

. The `+' and `ÿ' modi®ers that specify the mandatory presence or absence of a term were
used more than Boolean operators. About 1 in 12 users employed them. About one in 11
queries incorporated a `+' or `ÿ' modi®er. But a majority of these uses were mistakes
(about two out of three).
. The ability to create phrases (terms enclosed by quotation marks) was seldom, but correctly
used Ð while only one in 16 queries contained a phrase, mistakes were negligible.
. Most users searched one query only and did not follow with successive queries. The average
session, ignoring identical queries, includes 1.6 queries. About two in three users submitted a
single query, and 6 in 7 did not go beyond two queries.
. On average, users viewed 2.35 pages of results (where one page equals ten hits). Over half
the users did not access result beyond the ®rst page. More than three in four users did not
go beyond viewing two pages.
. The distribution of the frequency of use of terms in queries was highly skewed. A few terms
were used repeatedly and a lot of terms were used only once. On the top of the list, the 63
subject terms that had a frequency of appearance of 100 or more represented only one third
of one percent of all terms, but they accounted for about one of every 10 terms used in all
queries. Terms that appeared only once amounted to half of the unique terms.
. There is a lot of searching about sex on the Web, but all together it represents only a small
proportion of all searches. When the top frequency terms are classi®ed as to subject, the top
category is Sexual. As to the frequency of appearance, about one in every four terms in the
list of 63 highest used terms can be classi®ed as sexual in nature. But while sexual terms are
high as a category, they still represent a very small proportion of all terms. A great many
other subjects are searched, and the diversity of subjects searched is very high.

7. Conclusions and future research
We investigated a large sample of searches on the Web, represented by logs of queries from
Excite, a major Web search provider. However, we consider this study as a starting point. We
have begun the analysis of a new sample of over 1 million queries. We will compare the results
from this study with those of the larger study to isolate similarities and/or dierences. In this
larger study, we will address many of the research questions raised in this paper. While Web
search engines follow the basic principles of IR, Web search users seem to dier signi®cantly
from users of traditional IR systems, such as those represented by users of DIALOG or
assumed (and highly arti®cial) users of TREC. It is still IR, but a very dierent IR. Web users
are certainly not comfortable with Boolean operators and other advanced means of searching.
They certainly do not frequently browse the results, beyond the ®rst page or so. These facts in
themselves emphasize the need to approach design of Web IR systems, search engines, and
even Web site design in a signi®cantly dierent way than the design of IR systems as practised
to date. They also point to the need for further and in-depth study of Web users. For instance:
. The low use of advanced searching techniques would seem to support the continued research
into new types of user interfaces, intelligent user interfaces, or the use of software agents to
aid users in a much simpli®ed and transparent manner.
. The impact of a large number of unique terms on key term lists, thesauri, association
methods, and latent semantic indexing deserves further investigation Ð the present methods
are not attuned to the richness in the spread of terms.
. The area of relevance feedback also deserves further investigation. Among others, the
question of actual low use of this feature should be addressed in contrast to assumptions
about high usefulness of this feature in IR research. If users use it so little, what is the
impetus for testing relevance feedback in the present form? Users are voting with their
®ngers, but research is going the other way?
. In itself, the work on investigation and classi®cation of a large number of highly diverse
queries presents a theoretical and methodological challenge. The impact of producing a more
re®ned classi®cation may be re¯ected in making browsing easier for users and precision
possibly higher Ð both highly desirable features. Also, research into the language of Web
queries would be of bene®t to producers of information and data for Web users.
Certainly, the Web is a marvelous new technology. The fact that the authors of this paper met
and collaborated via the Web is an indication of the Web's potential impact. People have
always been unpredictable in how they will use any new technology. The impact that new
technology has on existing systems is also unpredictable. It seems that this is the case with the
Web as well. In the end, it all comes down to the users and the uses people make of the Web.
Maybe they are searching the Web in ways that designers and IR researchers have not
contemplated or assumed, as yet.
