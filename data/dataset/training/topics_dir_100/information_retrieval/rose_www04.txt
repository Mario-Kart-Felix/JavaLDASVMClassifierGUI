ABSTRACT 
Previous work on understanding user web search behavior has 
focused on how people search and what they are searching for, 
but not why they are searching.  In this paper, we describe a 
framework for understanding the underlying goals of user 
searches, and our experience in using the framework to manually 
classify queries from a web search engine.  Our analysis suggests 
that so-called “navigational” searches are less prevalent than 
generally believed, while a previously unexplored “resource-
seeking” goal may account for a large fraction of web searches.  
We also illustrate how this knowledge of user search goals might 
be used to improve future web search engines.

1. INTRODUCTION 
If we imagine seeing the world from the perspective of a search 
engine, our only view of user behavior would be the stream of 
queries users produce.  Search engine designers often adopt this 
perspective, studying these query streams and trying to optimize 
the engines based on such factors as the length of a typical query.  
Yet this same perspective has prevented us from looking beyond 
the query, at why the users are performing their searches in the 
first place. 
The “why” of user search behavior is actually essential to 
satisfying the user’s information need.  After all, users don’t sit 
down at their computer and say to themselves, “I think I’ll do 
some searches.”  Searching is merely a means to an end – a way to 
satisfy an underlying goal that the user is trying to achieve.  (By 
“underlying goal,” we mean how the user might answer the 
question “why are you performing that search?”) That goal may 
be choosing a suitable wedding present for a friend, learning 
which local colleges offer adult education courses in pottery, 
seeing if a favorite author’s new book has been released, or any 
number of other possibilities.  In fact, in some cases the same 
query might be used to convey different goals – for example, the 
query “ceramics” might have been used in any of the three 
situations above (assuming it is also the title of the book in 
question). 
What difference would it make if the search engine knew the 
user’s goal?  At the very least, the engine might provide a user 
experience tailored toward that goal.  For example, the display of 
relevant advertising might be welcome in a shopping context, but 
unwelcome in a research context.  In fact, we have argued 
elsewhere [10] that goal-sensitivity will be one of the crucial 
factors in future search user interfaces.  But the potential to 
capitalize on this goal sensitivity goes beyond the user interface.  
The underlying relevance-ranking algorithms that determine 
which results are presented to users might differ depending on the 
search goal.  For example, queries that express a need for advice 
might rely more on usage- or connectivity-based relevance 
factors, while those involving open-ended research might weight 
traditional information retrieval measures (such as term 
frequency) more highly. 
Our premise is that web searches reflect a diverse set of 
underlying user goals, and that knowledge of those goals offers 
the prospect of future improvements to web search engines.  
Achieving these improvements is an ambitious project involving 
three primary tasks.  First, we need to create a conceptual 
framework for user goals.  Second, we need a way for search 
engines to associate user goals with queries.  Third, we need to 
modify the engines in order to exploit the goal information. 
In this paper we focus on the first task, and the initial parts of the 
second:  characterizing user search goals and examining the 
problem of inferring goals from query behavior.   We begin in 
section 2 by looking at previous work on understanding 
information-seeking behavior.  Next, in section 3, we describe our 
model of search goals.  In section 4, we review the methodology 
used to classify queries using our model, and we provide some 
results from this analysis.  We conclude with some final thoughts 
about the applicability of this work. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
Studies of user search behavior have a long history in Information 
and Library Science.  These include studies of the reference 
interview process, long before most users had access to computer-
assisted search tools.  When search engines first became available 
for use by researchers, many studies were conducted that 
attempted to understand user search behavior in an online context.  
For example, Bates [4] looked at the different ways in which 
people performed searches, and later proposed ways to 
characterize the overall search process [5].  Belkin’s Anomalous 
States of Knowledge (ASK) framework was an early attempt to

model the cognitive state of the user and then translate this 
understanding into a practical design for an information retrieval 
system [6].  Included in the ASK study was an analysis of some of 
the different types of information needs of different users.  For 
example, one type of ASK was summarized as “Well-defined 
topic and problem,” while another was “Information needed to 
produce directions for research.” 
Once web search engines became available and popular, studies of 
web search behavior followed quickly.  For example, Silverstein 
et al. conducted an analysis of query logs from the AltaVista 
search engine, confirming some of the original findings of web 
search use, such as the predominance of very short queries [11].  
A summary of many of the early studies may be found in Jansen 
and Pooch’s 2000 review [9]. 
One of the most comprehensive attempts to understand web 
search behavior has been the ongoing research of Spink and her 
colleagues, who analyzed query logs of the Excite search engine 
from 1997, 1999, and 2001 [13].  Although there have been some 
changes in user behavior during this period (such as a decrease in 
willingness to look at more than one page of search results), Spink 
et al. found that general search strategies have remained fairly 
constant. 
Prior to the advent of the worldwide web, search engine designers 
could safely assume that users had an “informational” goal in 
mind.  That is, users’ reason for searching was generally to “find 
out about” their search topic.  This was due both to the nature of 
the population with access to full-text search engines (students, 
researchers, lawyers, intelligence analysts, etc.) and to the nature 
of the databases that could be searched (with services such as 
Westlaw, Dialog, Medline, Lexis/Nexis, etc.) 
But in the web era, search engines are used for more than just 
research.  Even the most cursory look at the query logs of any 
major search engine makes it clear that the goals underlying web 
searches are many and varied.  And while the vast body of work 
described above has helped us to understand what users are 
searching for and how their information-seeking process works, 
there have been few attempts to look at why users are searching. 
One of the few exceptions is Broder’s “Taxonomy of Web 
Search” [7].  Motivated by the idea that the traditional notion of 
an “information need” might not adequately describe web 
searching, Broder came up with a trichotomy of web search 
“types”:  navigational, informational, and transactional.  
Navigational searches are those which are intended to find a 
specific web site that the user has in mind; informational searches 
are intended to find information about a topic; transactional 
searches are intended to “perform some web-mediated activity.” 
3. A FRAMEWORK FOR SEARCH GOALS 
Our first task was to understand the space of user goals.  In 
particular, we needed to come up with a framework that could 
identify and organize a manageable set of canonical goal 
categories.  These goal categories, in turn, must encompass the 
majority of actual goals users have in mind when searching. 
To develop the goal framework, we looked at a sample of queries 
from the AltaVista search engine [1].  We brainstormed a variety 
of goal possibilities, based on our own experiences, some 
previous internal query analysis at AltaVista, and a preliminary 
examination of the query set.  This resulted in a flat list of goals.  
This list served as a basis for an initial goal classification 
framework, which we then used to categorize a sample of 100-200 
queries.  Next, we revised the framework to accommodate the 
results of the classification test.  Categories were modified, or new 
categories added, when queries did not fit the existing framework.  
Some goal categories proposed early on, such as “finding a place 
in the world” (e.g. a map request), were dropped as 
unrepresentative.  Some categories were merged, some were split 
more finely, and some entirely new ones arose. This propose-
classify-refine cycle was repeated three times, each with a new set 
of queries. 
One of our early findings was that there were many cases where 
the goal of the search was neither to find a web site nor to get 
information, but simply to get access to an online resource.  For 
example, a query such as beatles lyrics suggests not a 
desire to learn about lyrics to Beatles songs, but simply a desire to 
view the lyrics themselves.  This led to the creation of a broad 
new goal category that we call resource searches.  We believe 
these resource searches are a relatively neglected category in the 
search engine world. 
As we repeatedly revised the set of goal categories, we gradually 
reached the conclusion that the goals naturally fell into a 
hierarchical structure.  In fact, the top level of the hierarchy 
resembles Broder’s trichotomy, but our more general “resource” 
category replaces his notion of “transactional” queries.  Our 
resulting goal framework is shown in Table 1. 
We define the navigational goal as demonstrating a desire by the 
user to be taken to the home page of the institution or 
organization in question.  To be considered navigational, the 
query must have a single authoritative web site that the user 
already has in mind.  For this reason, most queries consisting of 
names of companies, universities, or well-known organizations 
are considered navigational.  Also for this reason, most queries for 
people – including celebrities – are not.  A search for celebrities 
such as Cameron Diaz or Ben Affleck typically results in a variety 
of fan sites, media sites, and so on; it’s unlikely that a user 
entering the celebrity name as a query had the goal of visiting a 
specific site. 
Informational queries are all focused on the user goal of 
obtaining information about the query topic.  This category 
includes goals for answering questions (both open- and closed-
ended) that the user has in mind, requests for advice, and 
“undirected” requests to simply learn more about a topic.  
Undirected queries may be viewed as requests to “find out about” 
or “tell me about” a topic; most queries consisting of topics in 
science, medicine, history, or news qualify as undirected, as do 
the celebrity queries mentioned above. Note that the two question-
goal categories do not require that the user explicitly express the 
query in the form of a question; the query “last czar of russia” is 
reasonably interpreted as a closed-class question “who was the 
last czar of Russia?”  Similarly, queries in the “advice” category 
may take many forms. 
The informational goal class also includes the desire to locate 
something in the real world, or simply get a list of suggestions for 
further research.  Most product or shopping queries have the 
“locate” goal – I’m searching the web for X because I want to 
know where I can buy X.  Plural query terms are a highly reliable 
indicator of the list goal.

other than information).  If the resource is something I plan to 
se in the offline world, such as song lyrics, recipes, sewing 
atterns, etc., we call it an “obtain” goal.  If the resource is 
omething that needs to be installed on my computer or other 
lectronic device to be useful, the goal is “download.”  If my goal 
s simply to experience (typically view or read) the resource for 
y enjoyment, the goal is “entertain.” The most common 
xample of queries with an entertainment goal were those that 
ealt with pornography. Finally, the “interact” goal occurs when 
he intended result of the search is a dynamic web service (such as 
 stock quote server or a map service) that requires further 
nteraction to achieve the user’s task. 
The search goal framework described above proved to be both 
stable (requiring no major revisions as new queries were 
encountered) and comprehensive (encompassing the goals of all 
the queries we had seen).  We were therefore able to move on to 
the second major task, associating goals with queries. 
4. ASSOCIATING GOALS WITH QUERIES 
There are two ways a search engine might associate goals with 
queries at runtime:  either the user can identify the goal explicitly 
through the user interface, or the system can attempt to infer the 
goal automatically.  Google’s “I’m feeling lucky” feature [8], in 
which users implicitly identify their goal as “navigate to a specific 
web site,” may be thought of as an early example of the first 
information, but because I want to use the resource itself. 
15
approach.  The second approach would involve automatic 
classification using statistical or machine learning methods; these 
methods in turn will require hundreds or thousands of examples of 
classified queries (and their associated features) as training 
examples. 
In either case, we need to know the relative prevalence of various 
goals.  And if we hope to infer goals automatically in the future, 
we need to know that it is possible to do so manually. This section 
describes our work on these initial aspects of the problem; the 
remaining parts of the task will be the focus of future work. 
4.1 Manual Query Classification 
In order to definitively know the underlying goal of every user 
query, we would need to be able to ask the user about his or her 
intentions.  Clearly, this is not feasible in most cases.  But can the 
goal be determined simply by looking at the query itself, or is 
more information required? 
We believe that in many cases, user goals can be deduced from 
looking at user behavior available to the search engine.  Included 
in this behavior are the following: 
 the query itself 
 the results returned by the search engine 
 results clicked on by the user 
 further searches or other actions by the user. 
We wanted to determine whether this was sufficient information 
for a human to consistently classify queries according to our goal 
framework.  Once we could successfully classify queries 
manually, we would be able to provide training data for a future 
automatic classification system. 
To facilitate the task of manual classification, we created a 
research tool that provided these four types of information for sets 
of queries taken from the AltaVista query logs.  A screen shot of 
the classification tool interface is shown in Figure 1.

4.2 Results 
Three sets of approximately 500 U.S. English queries1 each were 
randomly selected from the AltaVista query logs on different days 
and at different times of the day. These were manually classified, 
one set using the classification tool as described above, and two 
sets using an earlier version that did not contain the user’s event 
history.  Results are shown in Table 3.  (Note that the “open” and 
“closed” categories have been collapsed into a single “directed” 
category, due to the low numbers of results.) 
It is interesting to note that nearly 40% of queries were non-
informational in every case, and a large fraction of the 
informational queries appeared to be attempts to locate a product 
or service rather than to learn about it.  In fact, just over 35% of 
all queries appeared to have the kind of general research goal 
(questions, undirected requests for information, and advice-
seeking) for which traditional information retrieval systems were 
designed. 
It is also interesting that the relative distributions of goal 
categories are quite similar across the different query sets, despite 
the fact that they represented different dates during the year and 
different times of day.  Perhaps more importantly, the additional 
information about user click behavior used in the Set 3 results did 
not result in a substantially different mix of goals.  Although this 
requires further study, it suggests the surprising result that goals 
can be inferred with almost no information about the user’s 
behavior. 
Because the top level of our goal classification framework is 
similar to Broder’s web search taxonomy [7], we also examined 
how the distribution of our queries into the top-level goal 
categories compared with his.  Broder used two methods to 
classify queries, a user survey and manual classification of log 
entries.  The survey had one question intended to identify 
navigational queries, and one that allowed users to choose any of 
several tasks (shopping, downloading, etc.) that he considered 
“transactional.”  If none of these tasks was chosen, the query was 
assumed to be informational.  The log analysis followed a similar 
decision procedure.  Broder also eliminated sexually oriented 
queries, which accounted for about 10% of the data. 
Figure 2 compares our top-level goal classification with results 
reported by Broder.  (We are simplifying somewhat by equating 
Broder’s “transactional” category with our more general 
“resource” goal.)  We consistently found a greater proportion of  
informational queries, and a smaller proportion of navigational 
                                                                
1 The number was not exact because we started with a larger set 
and then discarded those that were either not English or used 
non-standard search operators such as “link:”.

and resource/transaction queries than the earlier study.  While the 
differences in informational and resource/transactional queries 
may be accounted for by our different definitions of those 
categories, this does not account for the large difference in the 
fraction of navigational queries. 
In fact, since Broder sampled all queries, while we sampled only 
session-initial queries, the actual difference in navigational query 
rates may be even higher.  This is because navigational query 
sessions are likely to be shorter and thus overrepresented in our 
session-initial measure.  However, it is not clear that this had any 
more impact than the other methodological differences used to 
obtain our respective data sets. 
If our findings about the relatively small number of navigational 
queries are accurate, they suggest that much of the attention in the 
commercial search engine world may be misdirected.  Tests such 
as the “Perfect Page Test” organized by one search engine 
newsletter [12] encourage search engine providers to focus on 
performance on navigational queries, even though this does not 
appear to reflect the majority of user needs.

5. FUTURE WORK 
In analyzing our results, we are aware of certain limitations that 
may restrict the generalizability of our conclusions.  One issue is 
that we have no way of knowing conclusively whether the goal we 
inferred for a query is in fact the user’s actual goal.  In the future, 
we would like to combine our work with user studies, including 
qualitative data such as diary reports of user goals.  In order to do 
this, we first need to make sure that our goal framework and 
classification methodology can be used by judges other than the 
authors. 
A second issue is that the AltaVista user population may not be 
representative of search engine users in general.  In particular, 
AltaVista’s reputation for providing more powerful query tools, 
combined with its relatively small market share, may make it the 
engine of choice for users with difficult informational queries, but 
not a first choice for typical users issuing common queries.  It is 
possible that this may account for some of the user behavior we 
saw, despite the fact that we already excluded queries with 
explicit Boolean syntax or other advanced search operators.  In 
order to investigate this issue, we hope to extend our research to 
Yahoo! search users. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
If web search engines are to continue to improve in the future, 
they will need to take into account more knowledge of user 
behavior – not just how people search, but why.  We have created 
a framework for understanding the underlying goals of search, and 
have demonstrated that the framework can be used to associate 
goals with queries given limited information. 
This analysis of user goals has already yielded two unexpected 
patterns in web search.  First, so-called “navigational” queries 
appear to be much less prevalent than generally believed.  Second, 
many queries appear to be motivated by a previously unexplored 
goal involving the need to obtain online and offline resources. 
More importantly, an understanding of search goals provides a 
foundation for tackling the larger problems of conveying user 
goals to a search engine (either explicitly or by inference), and 
modifying the engines’ algorithms and interfaces to exploit this 
knowledge.
