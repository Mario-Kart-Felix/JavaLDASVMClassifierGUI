type of CRT computer display 
which was very common in the 
early days of computing, from the 
1960s through the 1980s, before 
color monitors became popular. 
• They are still widely used in 
applications such as 
computerized cash register 
systems

Display Resolution
• The resolution of a monitor indicates how densely 
packed the pixels are. 
• In general, the more pixels (often expressed in dots 
per inch), the sharper the image. 
• Most modern monitors can display 1024 by 768 
pixels, the SVGA standard. 
• Some high-end models can display 1280 by 1024, 
or even 1600 by 1200.

Refresh Rate
• The refresh rate is the number of times in a second 
that a monitor draws the data.
• The refresh rate for a monitor is measured in hertz 
(Hz)
• The standard refresh rate is 75Hz, this means that the 
monitor redraws the display 75 times per second. 
• A flickering monitor can contribute to eyestrain and 
headaches. 
• The faster the refresh rate, the less the monitor 
flickers.

Color Depth
• Color depth describes how many colors that can be 
displayed on a monitor's screen.
• Common color depths used by monitor: 
– 4-bit (EGA) = 16 colors
– 8-bit (VGA) = 256 colors
– 16-bit (High Color) = 65,536 colors
– 24-bit (True Color) = 16 million colors

for taking computer data and generating a hard copy 
of that data. 
• Printers are one of the most used peripherals on 
computers and are commonly used to print text, 
images, and photos.

• It strikes paper and ribbon together to form a 
character, like a typewriter.
Advantages Disadvantages
• Less expensive
• Can make multiple 
copies with multipart 
paper
• Noisy
• Print quality lower in 
some types
• Poor graphics or 
none at all
• Slow

Impact Printer
Daisy-wheel
• Similar to a ball-head typewriter, this type of printer 
has a plastic or metal wheel on which the shape of 
each character stands out in relief. 
• A hammer presses the wheel against a ribbon, 
which in turn makes an ink stain in the shape of the 
character on the paper.
• Daisy-wheel printers produce letter-quality print but 
cannot print graphics.

Thermal Printer (Inkless)
• Thermal printers work by selectively 
heating regions of special heat-
sensitive paper. 
• These printers are commonly used 
in calculators and fax machines; and 
although they are inexpensive and 
print relatively fast, they produce low 
resolution print jobs.

Projector
Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) projector
• In the early days of projectors, CRT 
projectors were commonly used. 
• They utilized three tubes, one for 
each of the primary colors. 
• Due to their large size, low light 
output and the frequent need to 
converge and align the images 
projected from each of the three 
tubes, they are no longer commonly 
used.

Projector
Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) projector
• Long service life; CRT tubes maintain good 
brightness to 10,000 hours.
• CRT projectors are both considerably larger and 
heavier than comparable LCD and DLP projectors. 
• CRT projectors require far more time to set up and 
adjust than LCD and DLP based projectors.
CSCA0101 Computing Basics
43
Output Devices
Projector
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projector
• LCD projectors work by utilizing 
polarized mirrors that pass and 
reflect only certain colors of light. 
• This causes each channel of red, 
green and blue to be separated and 
later re-converged via a prism after 
passing through an LCD panel that 
controls the intensity and saturation 
of each color.

Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector
• DLP projectors can be classified as 
one-chip or three-chip. 
• One-chip DLP projectors can 
produce more than 16 million colors 
while three-chip models can produce 
more than 35 trillion colors. 
• This allows DLP projectors to 
reproduce more natural and lifelike 
images.
