Abstract 
It is known that the performance of speaker identification systems is high under 
the neutral talking condition; however, the performance deteriorates under the 
shouted talking condition. In this paper, second-order circular hidden Markov 
models (CHMM2s) have been proposed and implemented to enhance the 
performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification systems under 
the shouted talking condition. Our results show that CHMM2s significantly 
improve speaker identification performance under such a condition compared to 
the first-order left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM1s), second-order 
left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM2s), and the first-order circular 
hidden Markov models (CHMM1s). Under the shouted talking condition, our 
results show that the average speaker identification performance is 23% based on 
LTRHMM1s, 59% based on LTRHMM2s, and 60% based on CHMM1s. On the 
other hand, the average speaker identification performance under the same talking 
condition based on CHMM2s is 72%. 
 
Keywords: First-order left-to-right hidden Markov models, neutral talking 
condition, second-order circular hidden Markov models, shouted talking 
condition. 
 
1.  Introduction 
The goal of speaker identification systems is to decide which voice model from a 
known set of voice models best characterizes a speaker. The applications of 
speaker identification may be required in criminal investigations to determine the 
suspected persons produced the voice recorded at the scene of the crime, it may 
 3 
also be required in civil cases or for the media. These cases include calls to radio 
stations, local or other government authorities, insurance companies, or recorded 
conversations, and many other applications. 
 
Speaker identification systems typically operate in one of two cases: text-
dependent or text-independent case. In the text-dependent case, utterances of the 
same text are used for both training and testing (recognition). In the text-
independent case, training and testing involve utterances from different texts. The 
process of speaker identification can be divided into two categories: “open set” 
and “closed set”. In the “open set” category, a reference model for an unknown 
speaker may not exist; whereas, in the “closed set” category, a reference model for 
an unknown speaker should be available. 
 
2. Motivation 
In the last three decades, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become one of the 
most successful and broadly used modeling techniques in the fields of speech 
recognition and speaker recognition (Juang and Rabiner, 1991). HMMs are 
powerful techniques in optimizing the parameters that are used in modeling 
speech signals. This optimization reduces the computational complexity in the 
decoding procedure and improves the recognition accuracy (Huang et al., 1990). 
 
Most of the publications in the areas of speech recognition and speaker 
recognition focus on speech under the neutral talking condition and few 
publications focus on speech under stressful talking conditions. The neutral 
talking condition can be defined as the talking condition in which speech is 
 4 
produced assuming that the speaker is in a “quiet room” with no task obligations. 
Stressful talking conditions can be defined as talking conditions that cause a 
speaker to vary his/her production of speech from the neutral talking condition. 
 
Some talking conditions are designed to simulate speech produced by different 
speakers under real stressful talking conditions. Hansen, Cummings, and 
Clements used SUSAS (Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress) speech 
database in which eight talking conditions are used to simulate speech produced 
under real stressful talking conditions and three real talking conditions (Bou-
Ghazale and Hansen, 2000; Cummings and Clements, 1995; Zhou et al., 2001). 
The eight talking conditions are: neutral, loud, soft, angry, fast, slow, clear, and 
question. The three talking conditions are: 50% task, 70% task, and Lombard. 
Chen used six talking conditions to simulate speech under real stressful talking 
conditions (Chen, 1988). These conditions are: neutral, fast, loud, Lombard, soft, 
and shouted. 
 
Very few publications that focus on speech under the stressful talking conditions 
consider studying speech under the shouted talking condition (Cairns and Hansen, 
1994; Chen, 1988; Hansen, 1996). Therefore, the number of references in the 
areas of speech recognition and speaker recognition under the shouted talking 
condition is limited. The shouted talking condition can be defined as when a 
speaker shouts, his/her object is to produce a very loud acoustic signal, either to 
increase its range (distance) of transmission or its ratio to background noise.  
 
 5 
Speaker identification systems under the shouted talking condition can be used in 
the applications of talking condition identification systems. Talking condition 
identification systems can be used in telecommunications, military applications, 
medical applications, and law enforcement. In telecommunications, talking 
condition identification systems can be used to: improve the telephone-based 
speech recognition performance, route 911 (in U.S.A.) or 999 (in U.A.E.) 
emergency call services for high priority emergency calls, and assess a caller’s 
emotional state for telephone response services. The integration of speech 
recognition technology has already been seen in many military voice 
communication and control applications. Such applications involve stressful 
environments such as aircraft cockpits and military peacekeeping (Hansen et al., 
2000). Talking condition identification systems can be used also in medical 
applications where computerized stress classification and assessment techniques 
can be employed by psychiatrists to aid in quantitative objective assessment of 
patients who undergo evaluation. Finally, talking condition identification systems 
can be employed in forensic speech analysis by law enforcement to assess the 
state of telephone callers or as an aid in suspect interviews. 
 
Researchers are incorporating emotional capabilities into speech synthesis 
programs, hoping to enable computers that can communicate emotionally with 
users through expressive vocal signals such as laughter, sighing, or sad tones of 
voice. IBM is set to release a new Expressive Text-to-Speech Engine for 
commercial use that will deliver spoken information in the appropriate tone, and 
also include lifelike capabilities such as the ability to clear its throat, cough, and 
pause for breath (Stroh, 2004). AT&T Lab is developing the opposite technology, 
 6 
software that can detect users' emotional state; voice-response systems equipped 
with this software would be able to prioritize calls according to the person's state 
of agitation, for example (Stroh, 2004). 
 
In the last three decades, the majority of the work performed in the fields of 
speech recognition and speaker recognition on HMMs has been done using 
LTRHMM1s (Chen, 1988; Dai, 1995; Juang and Rabiner, 1991; Rabiner, 1989). 
Despite the success of using LTRHMM1s under the neutral talking condition, 
they yield low recognition performance under the shouted talking condition. 
 
In this paper, we show that using CHMM2s in the training and testing phases of 
isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification systems outperforms each of 
LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s under the shouted talking condition. 
 
Our work in this paper differs from the work in (Mari et al., 1996; Mari et al., 
1997; Zheng and Yuan, 1988) is that our work focuses on enhancing the 
performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification systems under 
the shouted talking condition based on CHMM2s. The work in (Mari et al., 1996; 
Mari et al., 1997) focuses on describing a connected word recognition system 
under the neutral talking condition based on HMM2s. The work in (Mari et al., 
1996; Mari et al., 1997) shows that the recognition performance based on HMM2s 
yields better results than that based on HMM1s. The work in (Zheng and Yuan, 
1988) focuses on enhancing speaker identification performance under the neutral 
talking condition based on CHMMs.

3.  Brief overview of left-to-right hidden Markov models 
HMMs use Markov chain to model the changing statistical characteristics that 
exist in the actual observations of speech signals. HMMs are double stochastic 
process where there is an unobservable Markov chain defined by a state transition 
matrix, and where each state of the Markov chain is associated with either a 
discrete output probability distribution (discrete HMMs) or a continuous output 
probability density function (continuous HMMs) (Huang et al., 1990). 
 
In the left-to-right (LTR) models, backward transitions are not allowed, and the 
models progress through the states in a left-to-right way. In these models, the state 
transition coefficients have the property of, 
 
This means that no backward transitions in time are allowed. In these models, the 
transition from a lower state to a higher state is the only transition that is allowed. 
Fig. 1 illustrates LTR models (Rabiner and Juang, 1983).

More details about LTRHMMs can be found in many references (Dai, 1995; 
Juang and Rabiner, 1985; Juang and Rabiner, 1991; Levinson et al., 1983; 
Rabiner and Juang, 1983; Rabiner, 1989). 
 
4.1  Second order hidden Markov models 
HMM1s have been used in the training and testing phases of the vast majority of 
the work in the areas of speech recognition and speaker recognition (Chen, 1988; 
Dai, 1995; Juang and Rabiner, 1991; Rabiner, 1989). The recognition 
performance based on HMM1s is high under the neutral talking condition; 
however, the performance is degraded sharply under the shouted talking condition 
(Chen, 1988; Shahin and Botros, 1998a, 1998b). 
 
New models called HMM2s were introduced and implemented under the neutral 
talking condition by Mari, Fohr, and Junqua (Mari et al., 1996). These models 
have shown to improve the performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker 
identification systems under the shouted talking condition (Shahin, in press). 
 
In HMM1s, the underlying state sequence is a first-order Markov chain where the 
stochastic process is specified by a 2-D matrix of a priori transition probabilities 
(aij) between states si and sj where aij are given as, 
 
  (7)sqsqProba i1tjtij  

In HMM2s, the underlying state sequence is a second-order Markov chain where 
the stochastic process is specified by a 3-D matrix (aijk). Therefore, the transition 
probabilities in HMM2s are given as (Mari et al., 1997),

4.2  Extended Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithms 
The most likely state sequence can be found by using the probability of the partial

The forward function t (j,k) defines the probability of the partial observation

where t (i,j) is defined as the probability of the partial observation sequence from 
t+1 to T, given the model  and the transition (si,sj) between times t-1 and t.

5.  Circular hidden Markov models 
Most of the work performed in the last three decades in the fields of speech 
recognition and speaker recognition using HMMs has been done using 
LTRHMMs (Chen, 1988; Dai, 1995; Juang and Rabiner, 1991; Rabiner, 1989). 
LTRHMMs yield high speaker identification performance under the neutral 
talking condition; however, the performance is deteriorated sharply under the 
shouted talking condition (Chen, 1988; Shahin and Botros, 1998a, 1998b). 
 
New models called CHMMs were introduced and used by Zheng and Yuan under 
the neutral talking condition (Zheng and Yuan, 1988). CHMMs are considered as 
another special class of HMMs. These models yield high speaker identification 
performance under the neutral talking condition (Shahin, 2004). The structure of 
CHMMs is shown in Fig. 2. CHMMs have the following properties (Zheng and 
Yuan, 1988): 
 
i. The underlying Markov chain has no final or absorbing state. 
Therefore, the corresponding HMMs can be trained by as long training 
sequence as desired. 
 
ii. Once the Markov chain leaves a state, that state can be revisited only 
at the next time. 
 
In CHMMs, the state transition coefficients have the property of, 
 aij = aji   i, j = 1,2,…,N         (17) 
Therefore, the state transition probability matrix A is a symmetrical matrix.

6.  Second-order circular hidden Markov models 
New models called CHMM2s have been proposed and used in this work to 
enhance the performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification 
systems under the shouted talking condition. This is the first known investigation 
into CHMM2s evaluated under the shouted talking condition for speaker 
identification systems. CHMM2s are considered as another special class of 
HMMs. CHMM2s are superiors over each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, and 
 15 
CHMM1s. This is because CHMM2s possess the characteristics of both CHMMs 
and HMM2s: 
 
1. The underlying state sequence in HMM2s is a second-order Markov chain 
where the stochastic process is specified by a 3-D matrix because in these 
models the state-transition probability at time t+1 depends on the states of 
the Markov chain at times t and t-1. On the other hand, the underlying 
state sequence in HMM1s is a first-order Markov chain where the 
stochastic process is specified by a 2-D matrix because in these models it 
is assumed that the state-transition probability at time t+1 depends only on 
the state of the Markov chain at time t. Hence, the stochastic process that 
is specified by a 3-D matrix gives more accurate speaker identification 
performance than that specified by a 2-D matrix (Shahin, 2005). 
 
2. The Markov chain in CHMMs is more powerful and efficient in modeling 
the changing statistical characteristics that exist in the actual observations 
of the speech signals than that in LTRHMMs.  
 
3. In LTRHMMs, the absorbing state governs the fact that the rest of a single 
observation sequence provides no further information about earlier states 
once the underlying Markov chain reaches the absorbing state. In speaker 
identification systems, it is true that a Markov chain should be able to 
revisit the earlier states because the states of HMMs reflect the vocal 
organic configuration of the speaker. Therefore, the vocal organic 
configuration of the speaker is reflected to states more appropriately and 
 16 
more conveniently using CHMMs than that using LTRHMMs. Therefore, 
it is inconvenient to utilize LTRHMMs having one absorbing state for 
speaker identification systems (Shahin, 2004). 
 
The initial elements of the parameters in the training phase of CHMM2s are 
chosen to be,

where 1(i,k) is the initial element of the forward probability of producing the 
observation O1.

7.  Speech database 
Our speech database in this work is composed of 20 adult native American male 
speakers and 20 adult native American female speakers. Each speaker utters the 
same 10 different isolated words where each word is uttered 9 times (9 utterances 
per word) under each of the neutral and shouted talking conditions. These words 
are: alphabet, eat, fix, meat, nine, order, processing, school, six, yahoo. The length 
of these words ranges from 1 to 3 seconds. 
 
Our speech database was captured by a speech acquisition board using a 10-bit 
linear coding A/D converter and sampled at a sampling rate of 8 kHz. Our 
database was a 10-bit per sample linear data. Each signal of the neutral and 
shouted talking conditions was applied to a high emphasis filter, H(z)=1–0.95z 
–1
. 
Each emphasized speech signal was applied every 10 ms to a 30-ms Hamming 
window. 12th order linear prediction coefficients (LPCs) were extracted from 
each frame by the autocorrelation method. The 12th order LPCs were then 
transformed into 12th order linear prediction cepstral coefficients (LPCCs). 
 
 18 
The LPCC feature analysis was used to form the observation vectors in each of 
LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, CHMM1s, and CHMM2s. The number of states, N, 
was 5. The number of mixture components, M, was 5 per state, with a continuous 
mixture observation density was selected for each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, 
CHMM1s, and CHMM2s. Our speech database was divided into training data 
under the neutral talking condition and test data under each of the neutral and 
shouted talking conditions. Our speech database in this work was a “closed set”. 
 
In the training session, one reference model is derived using 5 of the 9 utterances 
per the same speaker per the same word under the neutral talking condition. 
Training in this session has been done separately based on each of LTRHMM1s, 
LTRHMM2s, CHMM1s, and CHMM2s. Training of the models in each training 
session uses the forward-backward algorithm. 
 
In the testing (identification) session, each one of the 40 speakers uses 4 of the 9 
utterances per the same word (text-dependent) under the neutral talking condition 
and 9 utterances per the same word under the shouted talking condition. This 
session has been done separately based on each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, 
CHMM1s, and CHMM2s. Identification in each testing session uses the Viterbi 
decoding algorithm. Our speech database is summarized in Table 1.

9.  Discussion and conclusions 
This work is based on an isolated-word text-dependent second-order circular 
hidden Markov models speaker identifier trained by speech uttered under the 
neutral talking condition and tested by speech uttered under each of the neutral 
and shouted talking conditions. This is the first known investigation into 
CHMM2s evaluated under the shouted talking condition for a speaker 
identification system. 
 21 
Our work shows that training and testing an isolated-word text-dependent speaker 
identification system based on using CHMM2s significantly enhance the speaker 
identification performance under each of the neutral and shouted talking 
conditions compared to that based on using each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, 
and CHMM1s. The average improvement rate of implementing CHMM2s over 
each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s under each of the neutral and 
shouted talking conditions is summarized in Table 3.

It is evident from Table 3 that CHMM2s are superiors over each of LTRHMM1s, 
LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s under each of the neutral and shouted talking 
conditions. Table 2 shows that under the shouted talking condition: 
 
1. The average improvement rate of implementing LTRHMM2s over 
LTRHMM1s is 156.5%, which is a significant improvement of speaker 
identification performance. 
 
 22 
2. The average improvement rate of implementing CHMM1s over 
LTRHMM1s is 160.9%, which is a significant improvement of speaker 
identification performance. 
 
3. The average improvement rate of implementing CHMM2s over 
LTRHMM1s is 213%, which is a very significant improvement of speaker 
identification performance. 
 
It is evident from the previous 3 points and Table 3 that implementing CHMM2s 
under the shouted talking condition yields a very significant improvement of 
speaker identification performance compared to each of LTRHMM1s, 
LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s. This is because CHMM2s possess the 
characteristics of both CHMMs and HMM2s as were discussed in Section 6. 
 
Table 3 shows that the speaker identification performance under the neutral 
talking condition has been improved significantly based on implementing 
CHMM2s compared to that based on implementing LTRHMM1s; the average 
improvement rate of implementing CHMM2s over LTRHMM1s under such a 
talking condition is 6.1%. Comparing the average improvement rate of 
implementing CHMM2s over LTRHMM1s under the shouted talking condition 
(213%) with that under the neutral talking condition (6.1%), it is evident that the 
average improvement rate of implementing CHMM2s over LTRHMM1s under 
the neutral talking condition is much less than that under the shouted talking 
condition. The reason is that it is known that LTRHMM1s are powerful and 
efficient models under the neutral talking condition (Chen, 1988; Dai, 1995; 
 23 
Haung et al., 1990; Levinson et al., 1983); however, they are inefficient models 
under the shouted talking condition (Chen, 1988; Shahin and Botros, 1998a; 
Shahin, 2005). 
 
An experiment has been conducted under each of the neutral and shouted talking 
conditions to compare the speaker identification performance based on 
implementing CHMM2s with that based on implementing each of LTRHMM1s, 
LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s using the stress compensation technique. 
 
It is well known that the spectral tilt exhibits a large variation when the speaker  
talks under the shouted talking condition (Chen, 1988). Such a variation usually 
contaminates the distance measure and it is considered as one of the most 
significant causes of degradation in the speaker identification performance. One 
of the stress compensation techniques that removes the spectral tilt and enhances 
the speaker identification performance is the cepstral mean subtraction technique 
(Shahin and Botros, 1998a). 
 
Table 4 summarizes the results of the speaker identification performance under 
each of the neutral and shouted talking conditions for the 20 male speakers, 20 
female speakers, and their averages based on implementing each of LTRHMM1s, 
LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s using the cepstral mean subtraction technique. 
Comparing Table 2 with Table 4, it is apparent that CHMM2s are superiors over 
each of LTRHMM1s, LTRHMM2s, and CHMM1s using the cepstral mean 
subtraction technique under each of the neutral and shouted talking conditions. 
 
 24 
A naïve implementation of the recursion for the computation of  and  in each of 
CHMM2s and LTRHMM2s requires on the order of N3T operations, compared 
with N2T operations in each of CHMM1s and LTRHMM1s. Therefore, it is 
required more memory space in each of CHMM2s and LTRHMM2s than that in 
each of CHMM1s and LTRHMM1s.
