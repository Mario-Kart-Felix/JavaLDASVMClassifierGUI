Long Term Trends of Computer Architecture Research Funding as 
Seen through ISCA
Peter M. Kogge

University of Notre Dame
Abstract
Funding of advanced computer architecture research, especially of projects in academia, has
changed dramatically over the last few years. This paper attempts to quantify this change by ana-
lyzing funding as reported in all papers published in ISCA since its founding.
1. Introduction
Recently reported changes in government funding for research in computer architecture[1] has
raised a great deal of concern in the academic community about the future health of the field and
the potential effects this funding decline may have on innovation and advancements.
In an attempt to get a better handle on this funding, its sources and impacts, this paper reports on
an analysis that was done of one of the oldest running, and most respected, conferences devoted to
computer architecture, the International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA)[2].
Starting in 1973, ISCA has grown to a stature that attracts the best ideas in computer architecture
from both academia and industry, and literally has met in venues across the globe.
The analysis documented here involved examining literally every paper in all proceedings from
1973 through 2005 for both authorship and funding sources. A variety of statistics were then com-
puted on a per paper basis, a per year basis, and overall across all 32 years (there was no confer-
ence in 1974). Focus has been on funding sources, with the goal of determining how these have
changed over time. Special emphasis has been placed of funding of research at non-industrial
institutions, since it is assumed that many of the truly novel or wildly alternative ideas have been
born in the past, and will continue to be in the future, developed at such places. Additional empha-
sis will be placed on the major supporters of such research, especially the U.S. government.
A future companion paper will use a similar paper-by-paper analysis on the topic areas covered in
ISCA, and how they have changed over the years.
In terms of organization, Section 2 gives some overall statistics. Section 3 documents both the
approaches taken to analyzing authorship of the papers, and the analysis results. Section 4 does
the same for funding sources overall. Section 5 dives a bit deeper into the funding. Section 6 then
draws some general conclusions. The organization of Sections 3 through 5 is similar; presentation
of data followed by some impartial (hopefully) observations about that data. Section 6, however,
represents the opinions of the author on what those observations imply.
2. Overall Statistics
Following is a list of some overall statistics for the 32 years of proceedings analyzed:
Univ. of Notre Dame CSE Dept. TR #2005-16
Page 210/11/05
• There were 1158 papers presented, for an average of 36.2 per year.
• There were a total number of 3180 authors listed, for an average of 2.8 authors per paper.
• Out of these authors, 621 (19.5%) came from industry, the rest (80.5%) from universities,
government labs, and other non-profit research institutions.
• 172 (14.8%) of the papers were authored totally by industry authors, 849 (73.3%) by totally
non-industry, and 137 (11.8%) by a mixed group from both industry and non-industry.
• 564 (48.7%) of these papers listed at least some support from some U.S. government body;
369 (31.8%) from NSF in particular, and 186 (16%) from DARPA.
• 145 (12.5%) were totally funded by NSF; 41 (3.5%) totally by DARPA.
3. Authorship
Each paper was analyzed by the affiliations of all listed authors, with a count recorded matching
the number of authors from each institution. The affiliations used were those recorded just below
the title line, even though in some cases footnotes or other material may reflect an earlier affilia-
tion (such as a student that has moved on from academia to industry).
The names of each author-affiliated institution were kept separate, and as a set were divided into
two separate lists, those that were clearly industry and those that were non-industry. This latter
“non-industrial” category includes both academic institutions, government laboratories, and not-
for-profit research centers or consortia. The intent here is to try to distinguish between those insti-
tutions whose end focus is nominally on product (“for profit”), and those whose end focus is nom-
inally on new ideas (“non-profit”).
Some assumptions were made for simplification. Clear affiliation with an industrial research lab
was counted as part of that company’s overall count, and thus as an industrial affiliation. Likewise
divisions or groups within a company were ignored. Consultants and small consulting firms were
listed as industrial. Similarly, departments or laboratories within a university were also ignored in
favor of the university as a whole. This reflects the imprecision with which affiliations were orig-
inally listed by the authors, and our original desire to focus on the basic industrial/non-industrial
breakdown, and not the details of exactly who did what.
3.1. Authorship Counts
For each paper, the following counts were kept for each paper:
• Total number of Authors from Industry: the total number of individuals listed on the title line
of the paper whose affiliation as listed on the title line were from an industrial firm as defined
above.
• Total number of Authors from Non-Industry: the total number of individuals listed on the
title line whose affiliation was not from an institution classified as defined above as industry.
• Total number of Authors: the sum of the above two counts, equalling the total number of
individuals listed on the title line.
In some cases, an affiliation on the title line, particularly from industry, was footnoted to the effect
that the individual was part of some other institution during the preparation of the paper. Because
of the irregularity of such practice and the indeterminism as to how to count the affiliation at the
time the paper was prepared, only the title line affiliation was counted.
Univ. of Notre Dame CSE Dept. TR #2005-16
Page 310/11/05
Note also that no attempt was made to count or otherwise keep track of individual author names.
In a very few cases, author affiliation was not listed in the title line. In all such cases a search of
the text was able to identify an affiliation that allowed for an industry/non-industry discrimina-
tion.
Given these counts for each paper, an average number was computed for all papers in each year,
with results shown in Figure 1. The right-most entry in the graph, and all similar graphs in this
paper, is an average taken over the yearly numbers for all 32 ISCAs (note that in some cases this
may differ from an average computed from the totals from all papers, because each year had a dif-
ferent number of papers).
An alternative representation, Figure 2, gives additional insight into the number of authors. Each
bar represents 100% all papers in one year, with sub-partitions on the bar representing what per-
centage of the papers had exactly one, two, or three authors, and what percentage had more than
three.
3.2. Authorship Affiliation
On the basis of these authorship counts, each paper was placed in one, and only one, of three cat-
egories:
• All Industry Authors: all authors of the paper were marked as coming from industry, and none
from non-industry.
• All Non-Industry Authors: similar for the non-industry case.
• Mixed Industry/Non-Industry: there was at least one author from each of the above two cate-
gories.
In addition to categorization per paper, summary statistics were compiled on all papers in each
year’s proceedings, including:

• % of papers with all industrial authors: out of all papers for that year, what percentage had
all authors fall in the “all industry” category.
• % of papers with no industrial authors: out of all papers for that year, what percentage had
all authors fall in the “non-industry” category.
• % of papers with mixed authorship: out of all papers for that year, what percentage had at
least one author from each category.
These were graphed in bar form in Figure 3. Each bar represents 100% of all papers in one year,
with sub-partitions representing the above three percentages.
3.3. Observations on Authorship Trends
These charts point out several clear trends: 
1. The average number of authors per paper has been growing in a step-wise fashion, from about 
about 1.6, to about 2.9, to about 3.6 in the last decade, with a significant peak in 2004, and the 
most significant year-to-year drop-off in 2005. (Figure 1)
2. Looking at the distribution of number of authors per paper further, it appears that the era of the 
single author paper as a significant part of ISCA has been over for about the last decade, and 
with a similar but not as severe a decline in two-author papers. (Figure 2)
3. Three author papers went through a bubble in the “dot com” period, but are now back to his-
torical averages. (Figure 2)
4. The most growth has been in the number of papers with more than three authors, now 
accounting for almost 50% of the works presented. (Figure 2)
5. This growth has occurred almost entirely on the non-industrial side, with the average number 
of industrial authors per paper relatively flat at just under 1 for the last decade. (Figure 2)

6. Starting in the late 1980s there has been an approximate halving of the number of papers that 
were totally authored from industry, with a rough average of about 8% over the last few years. 
(Figure 3)
7. Since the mid 1990s there has been a trend, albeit uneven, of increased mixed industrial/non-
industrial authorship. How much of this are graduate students who have graduated to industry 
is unclear. (Figure 3)
4. Overall Funding Sponsors and Sponsorship
In addition to affiliation, counts were made for each paper of acknowledgement of funding
sources, if any. For this paper we term each explicit and individual recognition of funding as an
individual sponsorship, and the institution providing the support a sponsor. For each paper a
record was kept of the total number of sponsorships from each sponsor. The intent here was to
accurately portray the total number of different funding vehicles that supported the work
described in the paper, and do so in a way that allows for some insight into the source, type, and
purpose of the funding. Such acknowledgements were usually found on either the first page or in
a separate section towards the rear of the paper. 
4.1. Types of Support
For this analysis, these sponsorships were divided into several categories as follows:
• Sponsorship specifically for the work itself - we termed this Primary Sponsorship.
• Sponsorship in terms of fellowships for individual students
• Sponsorship in the form of equipment, unrestricted grants, and other types of aid.
There were some number of papers with no sponsorship given of any kind. As will be discussed

later, certain assumptions were made about such papers.
4.1.1. Primary Sponsorship
The category of primary sponsorship was intended to capture those funding sources that were
most directly involved with the funding of the specific research described in the paper, and was
recorded in the most detail. The name of the sponsoring organization was kept in a fashion similar
to that of the affiliations, and divided into two lists reflecting our interest in government policy
and computer architecture research: government sponsorship and non-government sponsorship.
The former included U.S. Federal agencies, national labs, foreign governments, and state govern-
ments. The bulk of the non-government were industrial firms, with a sprinkling of endowments
and philanthropic organizations.
Sponsorships listed as from a university were counted in a common column regardless of the uni-
versity, and grouped under the non-government category (regardless of whether it was a state or
private institution).
For certain U.S. agencies, namely DARPA and NSF, an attempt was made to identify the work
with a specific program (such as the PAC/C program for DARPA) or with a certain class of grant.
The latter was the case for NSF where grants were found listed under terms such as: Career, ACI,
ANI, ASC, CCR, CDA, CHE, DCR, ECS, HRD, ITR, CADRE, MCS, MIP, NGS, and PYI. In
many cases the same paper listed multiple entries for the same author, and/or a separate list for
different authors. Each specification of a separate funding source was counted separately, even if
it were a category corresponding to one already counted for the same or a different author. Thus,
for example if there were two authors and both listed individual NSF career awards, then the
count for this paper for NSF Career awards would be 2. Similarly, if several different grants were
listed for one paper, and some number of them came from the same program (typically NSF-
related), multiple counts would be included under that program to reflect that distinct funding
vehicles were involved. In one industrial case (IBM), there were a variety of distinct vehicles
mentioned, and again separate counts were kept for those also. 
However, when summary statistics are compiled and discussed in total below, all of the individual
counts were summed under one banner, such as NSF and IBM. In addition, while separate counts
for DEC, Compaq, and HP were kept, they tended to reflect a common logical source (as DEC
was purchased by Compaq, who was later purchased by HP), and thus a separate sum of all three
was also generated and reported.
We note the dissonance between the industrial versus non-industrial way we categorized authors,
and the governmental versus non-governmental way we categorized primary funding. They are
not the same, but were chosen deliberately to most accurately reflect answers to the key questions
that motivated this paper.
4.1.2. Implied Industrial Primary Sponsorship
In about one third of all papers, no explicit reference to a funding source is given. This was partic-
ularly common in the early days of the conference, but as the years moved on such cases became
largely limited to non-US academic or research institutions and to papers authored solely by
industry (usually a single firm). Well over a half of such cases fell into this industry-only author-
ship category. We make the assumption that in this latter case, what is being reported is a project
Univ. of Notre Dame CSE Dept. TR #2005-16
Page 710/11/05
funded by internal corporate funds. Consequently for any paper where all authors were from
industry, and there is no explicit funding source reported, we mark that paper as totally industry-
funded, with the number of sponsorships equalling the number of distinct industrial firms to
which the authors are affiliated. Those firms thus also became the recorded sponsors.
4.1.3. Fellowships
A second distinct type of support that was often acknowledged was that of student fellowship,
usually tied directly to the support of individual authors who were graduate students at the time of
the research. As before an attempt was made to accurately record the individual organizations
sponsoring the fellowship.
4.1.4. Equipment and other Grants
A final category of listed sponsorship was that of donated material, equipment, computer time, or
money not tied to any explicit research. This was usually clear when it was equipment being
donated, but in cases of doubt as to whether the grant was “in general” or tied to some project, the
decision was to list the support under the primary sponsorship label.
4.2. Statistics
Figure 4a diagrams the average number of sponsorships recorded per paper, per year. Separate
lines list the number of sponsorships from government and from non-government sponsors, the
number of fellowships, and the number that fell in the other category, all on a per paper basis. One
summary line represents the total number of primary sponsorships, and the other the total number
of sponsorships of all kinds. Note that this average is over the total number of papers in each
year’s proceedings, regardless of whether or not that paper recognized any sponsorship. If we
revise the basis for the averaging to just those papers that did record sponsorship, we get Figure
4b.
In terms of general sponsors for primary sponsorship, Figure 5 graphs how each year’s papers dis-
tributed into four categories: government only, non-government, mixed, and no discernible spon-
sor - even after the industrial authorship assumptions discussed above. The non-government
category includes papers that matched the assumptions of Section 4.1.2.
Finally, Figure 6 graphs the number of distinct primary sponsors per paper, averaged over only
those papers that reported primary sponsorship of some sort. Thus, if there were three NSF grants,
two DARPA grants, and one IBM grant reported, the total number of distinct sponsors counted for
that paper would be three: NSF, DARPA, and IBM. Separate lines list total, just government, and
non-government.
4.3. Sponsorship Trends
As with authorship, there are some significant trends that are revealed by this data:
1. The average number of sponsorships reported per paper increased continuously (by approxi-
mately a factor of 5) between 1973 and 2003, with a significant drop-off in 2004 and 2005. 
(Figure 4)
Univ. of Notre Dame CSE Dept. TR #2005-16
Page 810/11/05
2. The bulk of this growth, and drop-off in the last two years, has come from primary govern-
mental sponsorships - direct grants from a government entity in support of the research 
reported in the paper. This also exhibited a factor 5 increase from 1973 to the peak in 2003.

3. The only other increase has been in the areas of fellowships equipment and other grants from 
industry, with most of the growth since the early 1990s, but these numbers are small in rela-
tion to the primary sponsorships. (Figure 4)
4. The number of primary sponsorships per paper from industry has been essentially flat since 
the mid 1980s. (Figure 4)

Page 1010/11/05
5. In looking at the overall primary sponsorship of papers, the percentage of papers totally non-
government-funded has been uneven but declining, as has the number of papers with no dis-
cernible primary sponsorship. (Figure 5)
6. There is a visible trend, at least through 2003, towards increasing numbers of papers that are 
jointly funded by government and industry. (Figure 5)
7. Of those papers that reported primary sponsorship of some sort, the number of distinct non-
government sponsors per paper has been flat at about one since the late 1980s, with the num-
ber of distinct government sponsors peaking in the late 1980s through the mid 1990s, and 
declining somewhat since then. (Figure 6)
8. Peaks in the percentage of papers with no discernible funding seem to appear regularly at a 
seven year interval, with 2005 at or near such a peak. (Figure 5)
5. Inside the Funding Sources
In this section we discuss some more specific details of the of the funding sources discussed
above.
5.1. US Government-sponsored Papers
Figure 7 graphs those papers that acknowledged one or more primary sponsors from the U.S.
Government. Besides total percentage, separate lines gives the percentage of papers for the five
major U.S departments and agencies that show up on the top of the funding lists: NSF, DARPA,
DOE, NASA, and non-DARPA DoD agencies.

Page 1110/11/05
5.2. Non-governmental Sponsorship
Figure 8 diagrams paper distribution on the basis of non-governmental sponsorship. Again there
is both a total line and lines for the major individual sponsors - mostly industry: AT&T, the DEC/
Compaq/HP combination, IBM, Intel, and SUN, and one industrially funded collaboration, SRC.
5.3. Single Sponsor Papers
Another question deals with how many papers are sponsored by a single sponsor, with a related
sub-question as to how many of these are “single grant” papers. Such results give insight into the
ability to develop a leading edge concept in computer architecture as part of some larger project,
and not as an outgrowth of several different projects. Figure 9 summarizes such an analysis for
ISCA, with separate lines for both government and non-government sponsors, and for the govern-
ment sponsor case, separate lines for both NSF and DARPA.
5.4. Observations
Again this data leads to several interesting observations:
1. U.S. government funding, measured in terms of papers supported, rose significantly from the 
early 1990s, peaked in 2003, and has dropped precipitously since. (Figure 7)
2. NSF has been by far the major sponsor, especially in the last five years. (Figure 7)
3. DARPA sponsorships tends to run in seven to eight year cycles, with a floor of about 20% of 
all papers, until 2003, with a precipitous drop in the last two years. (Figure 7)

4. Non-DARPA DoD funding, never a major contributor, essentially terminated after 2001. (Fig-
ure 7)
5. All other agencies ran much smaller, and are no longer significant. (Figure 7)
6. Since the mid 1990s the major continuous non-governmental sponsors were IBM, Intel, and 
DEC/Compaq/HP. (Figure 8)
7. Intel was an insignificant sponsor until the mid 1990s, and then rapidly became the major 
industrial sponsor since then. (Figure 8)
8. IBM’s sponsorship had also accelerated significantly from 1996 to a peak of 25% of all papers 
in 2004. (Figure 8)
9. There has been a significant decline in all non-governmental sponsors in the last three years. 
(Figure 8)
10. Papers sponsored totally by a single governmental agency oscillate between 10% and 40%, 
with a long term average of perhaps 25% of all papers. (Figure 9)
11. Until about 1999, the bulk of the single-government sponsored papers were sponsored under a 
single grant, but since then this has dropped significantly, with multiple grants becoming the 
norm (Figure 9)
12. Since 2001 NSF has become the predominate government sponsor of single sponsored papers. 
(Figure 9)
13. Papers where DARPA was the sole sponsor first became significant in numbers in the mid 
1980s, with a significant decline after 2000 (with papers coming only from DARPA’s HPCS 
and PACC/C programs). (Figure 9)

14. Single non-governmental sponsored papers have also oscillated significantly, but with a 
decline from the 20% of all papers in the 1970s and 1980s to around 10% recently. Virtually 
all of these papers are also single grant papers. (Figure 9)
6. Conclusions
This section is solely the author’s opinions based on my readings of the above data, and is thus
subject to debate. Further, since the purpose of this paper is to provide insight into recent funding
decisions, the bulk of the comments are addressed to the recent past and to their effects on the uni-
versity research community.
Overall, I believe that the data does in fact indicate a significant change for the worse in funding
from all sources for computer architecture research, that this indication first appeared in the 2002-
2003 time period, and that it was probably due to funding decisions made a year or two earlier.
In general it appears that most conclusions can be separated into approximately decade long peri-
ods, with the first from 1973 through the mid 1980s, the second from the mid 80s to the mid
1990s, from the mid 90s until approximately 2001-2002, and from then until now.
Assuming that the number of authors correlates roughly to the intellectual effort and complexity
needed to bring a new idea in computer architecture to fruition, then this data shows that there has
been a very significant increase over the years, with rough plateaus matching the periods
described above. The single sharpest decline, however, has been this year, 2005. 
The same pattern can be observed when actually breaking down the number of authors per paper.
There were overall declines in one and two-author papers, and significant increases in three and
greater than three author papers. One-author papers essentially died in the mid-1990s. Again,
however, 2005 may be harbinger of a fundamental change, with single author papers increasing
sharply while multi-author papers declined sharply.
I also believe that the recent discussions about declining DARPA funding at universities, and
increasing difficulty in the success rates of NSF funding at the same also are backed up starkly by
the most recent data. Since the mid 1990s NSF and DARPA have become the major governmental
sponsors, and both have shown significant declines over the last two to three years. 
The same story is exhibited in the visible support from industry. In the mid to late 1990s Intel and
IBM picked up a lot of the funding slack from the non-NSF/DARPA sources, but they too have
experienced dramatic declines in the last few years.
Even before the recent downturns, however, there is evidence of the increasing difficulty of fund-
ing from a single source a large project with a significant result. The number of different sponsor-
ships climbed continuously over the years to a peak in 2005 of about five per paper, indicating
that each of the authors is essentially bring his or her own funding into play, and the group as a
whole of having to cobble together what are supposedly disparate grants into a focus on a single
topic. How true this topic is to the individual objectives of all these different funding sources is
unknown.
I believe that all of this is an indication of growing lack of support for the large team projects of
the recent past, and is correlated with the growth over the last two years of papers with no discern-
ible funding, and the sharp declines of funding. If this trends towards smaller research groups

continues, then it is likely that bold new ideas requiring significant proof of effectiveness will take
much longer to reach center stage to the point where they can be absorbed into mainstream prod-
ucts

9. Appendix - The Major Players
An interesting side note to the above discussion is to analyze exactly who are the “major players”
in computer architecture research. To do this we counted all authors from each institution, com-
puted the matching percent of all authors, and sorted by percent. We did the same in terms of
papers with authors from each institution. Figure 10 and list the top 10 in each category. The
major results were:
• 50% of all authors came from only 16 distinct non-industrial institutions.
• 50% of all papers had at least one author from one of 13 distinct non-industrial institutions.
• IBM and Intel provided the most industrial authors, but their totals would only place then
around 11th in comparison to the non-industrial institutions.
