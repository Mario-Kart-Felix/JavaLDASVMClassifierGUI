Chapter Overview
• This chapter includes:
– The key aspects of a computer;
– A brief history of the computer and its place within 
our modern society;
– The typical components within a computer system, 
focusing on the processor;
– The simulated processor, JASPer - the primary tool 
with which we are going to study the fundamental 
concepts of modern computers.

Computers Are Everywhere
• When many people think 
of a computer they think 
of the typical desktop 
PC, or laptop, or even 
the PDA. 
• Within this chapter I’ll 
show you that computers 
come in more guises 
than these, and yet they 
all contain the same 
fundamental 
components.

What Is A Computer?
• A hundred years ago a computer was a human being, either a 
mathematician or someone who worked for a mathematician. 
• A computer was someone who performed calculations to find 
the answer to a complex mathematical equation.
• They might not have even understood the calculations they 
were performing (in fact, it was often found that those 
individuals who didn’t understand the complex calculations 
actually performed better. Why? Because they wouldn’t be 
tempted to perform short cuts on their set of operations, which 
could actually introduce errors into the calculations). 
• A good computer simply followed very stringent rules.

What Is A Computer?
• A particular set of rules for one individual 
computer in the room might have been something 
like:
– Take the card from the person on your left;
– Multiply the last number on the card by three;
– Write the result on the card;
– Hand the card to the person on your right;
– Repeat all operations again.

What Is A Computer?
• It wasn’t until the early 1940s that electrical devices 
were first referred to (most probably by an American 
called Atanasoff) as computers.
• Over the years the rough definition of a computer has 
evolved to this:
– It must take input of some sort;
– It must produce output of some sort;
– It must process the information somehow;
– It must have some sort of information store;
– It must have some way of controlling what it does.

What Is A Computer?
• At the heart of any computer you will find a component 
called a processor, more formally described as a 
Central Processing Unit, or CPU.
• A processor that is constructed completely as a very 
large electrical circuit - called an integrated circuit - on 
one single chip of silicon (colloquially called a computer 
chip) is called a microprocessor. 
• What we term a computer these days is more 
accurately called a microprocessor based computer 
system or micro-computer .

What Is A Computer?
• It is microprocessors used within embedded systems
(contained in some greater device, like a car or a mobile 
phone - such that the microprocessor is part of the 
greater device) that are becoming the largest market 
within computing. 
• Never has there been a better time to gain a 
fundamental knowledge of how microprocessors work, 
as this knowledge is increasingly in demand now that 
microprocessors are truly everywhere.

A Very Brief History Of The 
Computer
• A few computer firsts:
– Charles Babbage invented mechanical machines;
– In 1936 Alan Turing defined the Turing Machine - the 
practical grounding for computing machines;
– During WWII, Station X was the birthplace of a machine 
called Colossus. Colossus was effectively the first 
programmable logic calculator;
– After WWII, the Manchester ‘Baby’ was the first computer 
that stored its programs and its data in the same memory -
an idea that is used by almost all modern computers today, 
it’s referred to now as a von Neumann architecture, named 
after the famous Hungarian born mathematician John von 
Neumann.

A Very Brief History Of The 
Computer
• More computer firsts:
– 1947 : The invention of the transistor;
– 1958 : The invention of the integrated circuit;
– 1971 : A young company called Intel produced the very first 
microprocessor:
• Intel 4004 and contained around 2300 transistors on a single chip;
• Chip technology is now so advanced that we are close to having one 
billion transistors on a single chip.
– 1981 : The first Personal Computer.

Inside A Computer

Inside A Computer
• In the figure on the previous slide I’ve taken the case off a 
typical PC (many of the internal cables have been 
removed):
– The most important component is the processor. It runs a 
series of instructions (called a program), and controls the 
activity of all other components within the computer;
– Next we have the memory chips. These are used to store our 
data and instructions;
– The other labelled components include the hard disk, the 
graphics card, network card and the power supply. All are used 
by modern computer systems, but are actually quite minor in 
the scale of things - we don’t need to refer to them to learn how 
a computer works.

The Minimalist Approach
• What are the smallest number 
of components we need to 
build a computer? We need:
– A processor - to process 
information, and to control the 
system;
– Memory - for data and 
instruction storage;
– Some form of input device; 
we’ll use a keyboard to enter 
data into the system;
– Some form of output device; 
we’ll use a monitor screen so 
we can see what our computer 
is doing.

The Minimalist Approach
• To build our simple processor 
we need the following 
components:
– Some Registers - a register is a 
store where we can place one 
piece of data;
– An Arithmetic Logic Unit, or 
ALU - a very basic calculator 
for our processor. The ALU will 
have some registers inside it, 
as we will see later;
– A Control Unit, or CU - to run 
the processor;
– Some buses - to allow us to 
move data from one 
component to another.

Here’s One We Prepared Earlier
• JASPer
– A Windows program 
that simulates the 
JASP processor in a 
simple system

Chapter Summary
• The key aspects of a computer
– Any processor based system has five key aspects - it takes 
input, it produces output, it processes data, it has an 
information store and it controls what it does;
– Most modern computers use a von Neumann architecture.
• A brief history
– Hardware developments, notably the invention of the transistor
in 1947, and the development of integrated circuits during the 
1970s, lead to the introduction of the personal computer. 
Although other companies produced PCs before IBM, it is IBM 
that cornered the PC market.

Chapter Summary
• The typical components within a computer
– A rudimentary computer requires a processor and a memory, 
as well as some simple I/O devices;
– Modern computers have many I/O devices that we do not need 
to examine in order to understand the fundamentals of a 
computer system.
– A processor consists of registers, an ALU and a CU all 
connected by buses.
• The simulated processor, JASPer
– JASPer models our simple processor, and can be used to 
execute programs.
