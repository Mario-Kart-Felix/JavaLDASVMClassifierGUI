Project Proposal and Topics 
 
 
Prof. Onur Mutlu 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Fall 2013 
 
Research Project 
n  Your chance to explore in depth a computer architecture 
topic that interests you  
n  Perhaps even publish your innovation in a top computer 
architecture conference.  
n  Start thinking about your project topic from now! 
n  Interact with me and the TAs 
n  Read the project topics handout well 
n  Groups of 2-3 students (will finalize this later) 
n  Proposal due: within 3 weeks of first recitation session

Research Project  
n  Goal: Develop (new) insight 
q  Solve a problem in a new way or evaluate/analyze systems/ideas 
q  Type 1:  
n  Develop new ideas to solve an important problem 
n  Rigorously evaluate the benefits and limitations of the ideas 
q  Type 2: 
n  Derive insight from rigorous analysis and understanding of existing 
systems or previously proposed ideas 
n  Propose potential new solutions based on the new insight 
n  The problem and ideas need to be concrete 
n  Problem and goals need to be very clear

Research Proposal Outline: Type 1 
n  The Problem: What is the problem you are trying to solve 
q  Define very clearly. Explain why it is important. 
n  Novelty: Why has previous research not solved this problem? What are its 
shortcomings?  
q  Describe/cite all relevant works you know of and describe why these works are 
inadequate to solve the problem. This will be your literature survey.   
n  Idea: What is your initial idea/insight? What new solution are you 
proposing to the problem? Why does it make sense? How does/could it 
solve the problem better? 
n  Hypothesis: What is the main hypothesis you will test? 
n  Methodology: How will you test the hypothesis/ideas? Describe what 
simulator or model you will use and what initial experiments you will do. 
n  Plan: Describe the steps you will take. What will you accomplish by 
Milestone 1, 2, 3, and Final Report? Give 75%, 100%, 125% and 
moonshot goals.  
All research projects can be (and should be) described in this fashion.

Research Proposal Outline: Type 2 
n  The Problem: What is the problem/phenomenon you are trying to evaluate? 
q  Define very clearly. Explain why it is important. 
n  Novelty: How has previous research evaluated this? What are its 
shortcomings?  
q  Describe/cite all relevant works you know of and describe why these works are 
inadequate to solve the problem. This will be your literature survey.   
n  Evaluation method: How will you evaluate the phenomenon/idea? What 
experimental infrastructure will you design? How would that experimental 
infrastructure enable you to reliably evaluate the phenomenon/idea? 
n  Hypotheses: What hypotheses will you test? 
n  Methodology: What are your plans for evaluation? What experiments will 
you run? How will you do the data analysis? 
n  Plan: Describe the steps you will take. What will you accomplish by 
Milestone 1, 2, 3, and Final Report? Give 75%, 100%, 125% and moonshot 
goals.  
All research projects can be (and should be) described in this fashion.

Heilmeier’s Catechism (version 1) 
n  What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using 
absolutely no jargon. 
n  How is it done today, and what are the limits of current 
practice? 
n  What's new in your approach and why do you think it will 
be successful? 
n  Who cares? 
n  If you're successful, what difference will it make? 
n  What are the risks and the payoffs? 
n  How much will it cost? 
n  How long will it take? 
n  What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for 
success? 
6 
Heilmeier’s Catechism (version 2) 
n  What is the problem? 
n  Why is it hard? 
n  How is it solved today? 
n  What is the new technical idea? 
n  Why can we succeed now? 
n  What is the impact if successful?
