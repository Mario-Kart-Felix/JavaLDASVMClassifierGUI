1. Introduction
Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an artificial intelli-
gence (AI) approach that capitalizes on past experi-
ence to solve current problems. It may be viewed,
simultaneously, as a research paradigm, as a per-
spective on human cognition and as a methodologyU

128edicine is a highly data intensive field where it is
advantageous to develop a system capable of
reasoning from pre-existing cases from an elec-
tronic medical record, for instance, or from cases
mined from the data.
Both research and the practical application of
CBR in the health sciences are currently experien-
cing rapid growth and development. Two workshops
on case-based reasoning in the health sciences were
recently held to provide a forum for identifying
important contributions and research opportunities.
The first of these was held at the International
Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR-03),
in Trondheim, Norway, in 2003 [2]. The second
was held at the European Conference on Case-Based
Reasoning (ECCBR-04), in Madrid, Spain, in 2004 [3].
In total, 17 papers were presented, representing the
research and experience of 37 authors, working in 10
different countries, on a wide range of problems and
projects. The insights and contributions of those
who participated in these workshops are manifested
in this paper. Here, we reflect on some pioneering
efforts in this field, summarize the current state of
the art, describe current trends and issues, and look
forward to future research directions. C 129

E2. Early work
The first noted application of CBR in the health
sciences was a proof of the concept that CBR could
be applied to the medical field [4]. Anecdotally,
these authors decided to collaborate on some
research when they met at a conference and were
pleased to discover that they had the same last
name. From this chance meeting grew the idea
for a paper by Janet Kolodner — a CBR researcher
— and Robert Kolodner–—a psychiatrist and
researcher in mental health computing. Their paper
[4] presented SHRINK, a CBR system designed to be a
psychiatric diagnostician, capable of reasoning fromU

a combination of category descriptors and cases to
guide diagnosis and treatment. One of SHRINK’s
characteristics was that it would get better over
time, as its memory would learn new cases as it
processed them–—following the CBR paradigm of
learning from success and failure situations.
Although SHRINK was not a fully implemented sys-
tem, many of its ideas have since been implemented
in MNAOMIA [5], a case-based diagnosis and treat-
ment system for eating disorders in psychiatry.
CASEY was one of the first CBR systems built in a
health sciences domain [6]. CASEY diagnosed heart
failure patients by comparing them to earlier
patients whose diagnoses were known. It incorpo-
rated and extended an earlier model-based system,
which diagnosed heart failures based on a physio-
logic model of the human heart. A diagnosis, in
CASEY, was represented as a graph, showing the
causality among the different symptoms and fea-
tures of a patient. CASEY was originally cited for its
efficiency, as it produced diagnoses comparable to
the model-based system, but it did so at a faster
order of magnitude. CASEY has since been recog-
nized for pioneering the integration of CBR with
another reasoning methodology, a trend that con-
tinues to this day in health sciences applications.
PROTOS was another early CBR system, which
diagnosed audiological disorders [7]. PROTOS incor-
porated the knowledge of an expert audiologist and
approximately 200 actual patient cases. A diagnosis
in PROTOS was a categorical label, assigning a new
patient to one of a number of pre-specified diag-
nostic categories. A new patient was effectively
classified as having the same diagnosis as other
similar past patients. PROTOS was influential in that
its approach was adopted for building systems in
other domains. For example, ProtoISIS was devel-
oped using the same techniques to select the most
appropriate diagnostic imaging procedures for a
patient [8]. An in-depth review of early work in
CBR in the health sciences is available in several
excellent summary articles [9—11]. Here, we briefly
note some other early influential systems:- MEDIC diagnoses pulmonary disease [12];
- ALEXIA determines a patient’s hypertension etiol-
ogy [13];- FLORENCE assists with nursing diagnosis, prognosis
and prescription [14];- ROENTGEN helps to design radiation therapy plans
[15];- MacRad helps to interpret radiological images
[16];- HPISIS diagnoses degenerative brain diseases
through image segmentation of CT and MR brain
images [17];ARTMED 873 1–9

Table 1 provides a brief overview of the systems
discussed at the two Workshops on CBR in the health
sciences. Here, we discuss these systems and the
trends and issues they represent.
ALEXIA, MNAOMIA and CARE-PARTNER are influen-
tial systems that have been presented earlier in other
venues [25,5,20,13]. Here, they are of continuing
interest in that (a) safety issues are being addressed
[26] and (b) they are being integrated to provide a
basis for semantic interoperability in CBR systems in
biology andmedicine [27]. ALEXIA combines CBRwith
a causal, physiopathological model to diagnose
hypertensiondisorders.MNAOMIAassists clinical staff

hypotheses for psychiatric eating disorders. It relies
on cases, concepts, prototypes and models in its
reasoning processes. CARE-PARTNER combines CBR
with rule-based reasoning toprovidedecision support
for the long-term follow-up care of stem-cell trans-
plant patients. As stem-cell transplants are still new,
CARE-PARTNER implements evidence-based medical
practice by formalizing guidelines established for the
care of stem-cell transplant patients. Some current
trends evidenced by these systems include the use of
multi-modal reasoning and the need to represent
time series data in order to reason about patient
progress over time [28].
The issue of patient safety is raised and addressed
by CARE-PARTNER [26]. CARE-PARTNER provides
advice to hometown healthcare providers after
stem-cell transplant patients return to their home
communities. Because these patients are immuno-
compromised, seemingly small problems can esca-
late quickly; timely, accurate advice is essential.
The possibility that a patient could be harmed by a
system error was a major issue to overcome in
fielding this system. CARE-PARTNER employs an
introspective reasoning process in which it deter-
mines which signs, symptoms and recommendations
are safety-critical. It provides non-safety-critical
advice immediately, but contacts expert clinicians
to assist in critical situations. Safety is an important
issue for all CBR systems that influence patient
treatment, especially those that automatically gen-
erate patient recommendations, rather than simply
providing retrieved cases to health care profes-
sionals to support their own reasoning.
Most recently, ALEXIA, MNAOMIA and CARE-PART-
NER have provided the test bed for Mémoire, a
framework for unifying and sharing case bases and
biomedical CBR systems [27]. Most CBR systems toC

date have been stand-alone systems, which makes it
difficult for system users to find all the support they
need and for CBR systems developers to build upon
each others’ efforts. Issues raised include patient
privacy, the security of patient data and adopting
the best technological approach to facilitate inter-
operability. Mémoire employs a semantic approach,
similar to that developed for the semantic Web, for
sharing and distributing cases, prototypical cases,
case-based ontologies and CBR systems in biology
and medicine.
Gene Finder [29] and the system for NutriGe-
nomics [30] are two researchprototypes that portend
CBR’s promise for applications in bioinformatics.
Gene Finder analyzes nucleotide sequences to iden-
tify DNA segments that encode biological function-
ality. It employs a case library of nucleotide segments
that have already been classified as coding or non-
coding to find the coding regions in previously unseen
strands of DNA. The long-range goal of this system is
to advance gene therapy, through the identification
and eventual alteration of genes that cause disease.
The system for NutriGenomics provides personalized
nutrition counseling by leveraging emerging knowl-
edge of how molecular nutrients affect gene expres-
sion to promote health and to prevent disease. It
makes use of ontologies to represent domain knowl-
edge, data mining techniques to extract knowledge
from external databases and a distributed case base
structure. It configures a dietary strategy for an
individual, considering his/her own genetic makeup
as well as his/her current health status and dietary
lifestyle. While neither system is fully implemented,
both provide frameworks for continuingwork in case-
based bioinformatics. Additional work in this area
was recently reported in ref. [31]. Here, it was noted
that CBR is a good fit for bioinformatics applications
as there are massive amounts of data, many
unknowns, and an incomplete, evolving, domain
theory.
CASEREC, which identifies hazardous airborne
fungi [32,33] and HR3Modul, which classifies respira-
tory sinus arrythmia (RSA) sequences [34,35], illus-
trate a growing capacity to automate analysis of
medical images and biophysical signals. While the
use of images and continuous measurements is not
new to medical CBR systems, many prior systems
have depended upon manual extraction of relevant
features and/or manual analysis of retrieved
images. To automate these tasks, there is a focus
on developing novel metrics to detect similarity in
non-textual data. CASEREC analyzes digital micro-
scopic images to detect contaminants in working
environments. It combines CBR with model-based
image analysis to recognize fungi spores by learning
shapemodels from past images and applying them toU

new images. In this way, it detects objects in images
that are highly likely to be fungi spores and then
identifies the types of fungi spores detected.
HR3Modul classifies RSA sequences by analyzing
sensor readings of the variations in heart rate that
occur with breathing. Each measurement is taken
for 10—15 min and includes 60—80 respiration
cycles. The sequence analysis is used to diagnose
stress-related disorders.
The Wellworks/Heartworks Advisor/Trainer
(WHAT) [36], SMARTHOME [37] and the support sys-
tem for endocrine therapy [38,39] are prescriptive
systems. WHAT helps sports medicine students learn
to prescribe exercise regimens for patients already
diagnosed with cardiac or pulmonary problems. This
system serves an educational role by automatically
generating independent case-based and rule-based
prescriptions for the same patient and allowing
students to compare them. The SMARTHOME proto-
type recommends the most effective technological
aids for individuals impaired in their capabilities
needed for successful independent living. Using
the commercial ReCall shell with an iterative deci-
sion tree retrieval, this prototype was able to pro-
duce recommendations comparable to an expert’s.
The endocrinology system prescribes and monitors
levothyroxine dosages for patients diagnosed with
hypothyroidism. This system extends the prescrip-
tive capabililities of WHAT and SMARTHOME, in that
it follows patients over time and adjusts dosages in
response to patient conditions. It also provides a
framework for other medical conditions in which
initial therapies may not be effective and may need
adjustment. Other systems with prescriptive com-
ponents include MNAOMIA, CARE-PARTNER, NutriGe-
nomics and Somnus. Other systems with tutorial
functionality include CARE-PARTNER, Somnus and
FM-Ultranet. Other systems that follow patients
and adjust treatment over time are CARE-PARTNER,
MNAOMIA and RHENE.
Assessing treatment efficacy using case-based
retrieval is the focus of RHENE, which monitors
hemodialysis sessions for patients with end-stage
renal disease [40]. A typical hemodialysis session
lasts for 4 h, during which 25 variables are auto-
matically sampled at 1 s intervals. Each hemodia-
lysis session is represented as a case, containing the
time-series data collected and additional static
features that characterize the patient. This system
allows physicians to analyze current problems by
considering past patterns of failure over time and
the solutions provided in terms of prescribed dialysis
flow rates. It also supports quality assessment of the
hemodialysis service. FM-Ultranet [41] and Somnus
[42] are primarily diagnostic systems. Diagnosis was
the first task supported bymedical CBR systems, andARTMED 873 1–9

diagnostic systems continue to make important con-
tributions.
FM-Ultranet [41] supports ultrasonagraphists in
detecting fetal malformations. When a practitioner
detects an abnormality during a routine ultrasound
screening, FM-Ultranet helps to determine if the
abnormality is dangerous. Future plans for this sys-
tem include incorporating automated image analysis
and pattern recognition techniques. FM-Ultranetwas
implemented using the commercial CBR-Works shell.
Somnus [42] is a prototypical system for respiratory
therapy students in sleep disorders clinics. It helps
students diagnose and treat obstructive sleep apnea,
a breathing disorder that repeatedly wakes patients
from sleep. Somnus provides support by retrieving
cases similar to a student’s current case for compar-
ison. It also allows students to review patient profiles
and to analyze treatments and patient compliance.
Somnus combines semiotics, fuzzy logic anddatabase
query techniques with CBR.
SISAIH [43] provides decision support for author-
izing admissions to Brazilian hospitals. It supports
financial accountability by ensuring that admissions
are justified. It detects billing errors by comparing
current admissions records to past ones, focusing on
multiple admissions of the same patient. As the
requisite financial data had already been main-
tained online, SISAIH was able to streamline a cum-
bersome manual review process using a standard
CBR approach.
4. What’s next?
As pioneering work and the work presented at these
workshops illustrate, the health sciences have pro-
ven to be a fruitful application domain for CBR. CBR
systems in the health sciences have started from
systems aimed at modeling medical expertise [4],
and case-based learning as the process by which
physicians learn their expertise through medical
practice. They have evolved into the design of
case-based assistants for clinical practice, quality
control and clinical forecast. It is expected that the
interest in CBR systems in the health sciences is
going to grow, as longer life expectancy forces a
focus on health care and human biology.
A physician — a psychiatrist — once portrayed
what he envisioned as the perfect computer pro-
gram to assist him in his clinical work. He described
representing in a database all the patients he had
been treating, with all the details of their history,
environment, symptoms, diseases, treatments and
evaluations. He also imagined that he could get
access to patient cases of his colleagues. When
encountering a new patient or a new disease epi-U
N
sode, the system would find the most similar
patients and patient episodes, would show them
to him, would explain the similarities and differ-
ences and how each episode was solved successfully,
and finally would provide recommendations for
diagnosis and treatment for the particular episode
he was dealing with. Ultimately, realizing this vision
is one of the main goals of CBR in the health
sciences. With this in mind, we here propose a
roadmap for the future and point out some pitfalls
that may arise along the way.
4.1. Roadmap for the future
Highlights of the trends and opportunities that may
develop for CBR in the health sciences are the

Formalization of CBR in the health sciences: Many
case-based reasoning systems have been success-
fully developed in the medical and biological
domains. A next step in this area of research is
to study what is common among these systems,
starting from case representation formalism. In
particular, formalized case representation lan-
guage [27], case structure and reasoning processes
[38,39] will become more available and more
important.We can see this as a necessary evolution
paralleling the evolution of the World Wide Web
from HTML, to XML and on to OWL as a representa-
tion language for Web resources. The benefits of
this evolution are numerous, among them the abil-
ity to make case bases and CBR systems interoper-
able, to provide a universal query language for case
bases and to allow the integration of CBR with
information search and retrieval, as well as with
other systems and methods [25].- BTioinformatics applications: The decoding the
Human Genome and the growing availability of
genetic data are going to foster the development
of CBR applications in bioinformatics and the
integration of genetic data into the medical pro-
file of a patient case. Since biomedical informatics
is rapidly developing at the frontier between
medical informatics and bioinformatics, CBR sys-
tems will also have to reason from both types of
data and to integrate methods from both fields.
CBR potentially can be a method of interest in
bioinformatics itself [29—31]. We also note here
the work of some researchers who see CBR as a
method to assist biomedical research [20].- Integration with electronic patient records in
healthcare settings: Methods from the cognitive
sciences will assist in this process, as will close co-
operation with health informatics specialists. CBR
systems in healthcare environments will have toARTMED 873 1–9

5334be safe [26], usable and incorporate standards of
care, in particular, evidence-based medical prac-
tice [20]. The formalization efforts mentioned
above will also play an important role in this
integration. When CBR systems are able to take
advantage of patients’ representations in electro-
nic health records, they will become applicable to
a wide range of diseases. It is exciting to think of
the vast number of potential case bases, the
knowledge of which is dormant simply because
CBR systems have been developed from a differ-
ent tradition–—artificial intelligence versus health
informatics. CBR researchers need to invest time
learning from the Informatics community decades
of work representing patient data, exchanging
patient records and formalizing clinical knowl-
edge. Efforts and achievements such as HL7 are
highly pertinent for CBR research. CBR research-
ers will then be able to integrate this work and
bridge the gap between their medical case repre-
sentations and those developed for electronic
patient records.535- In

553tegration with information retrieval: CBR
shares a common framework with information
retrieval; with the growing availability of textual
information, including that inmedical records, co-
operations between textual CBR and information
retrieval will develop. Methods for learning cases
from text will facilitate the development of CBR
systems from medical literature [30] and CBR
systems without initial cases. Many medical insti-
tutions either encourage or force care providers —
physicians, physician assistants or nurses — to take
electronic notes about patient visits, consulta-
tions or hospitalizations. An example is the VA
system, which has reached a completely electro-
nic state for patient records. These textual traces
of the clinical problem-solving process are cur-
rently an untapped source of case bases that
textual CBR could take advantage of. C 554- F555

eature mining: In several applications, the case
representation will be more complex than in past
CBR systems. For example, case data will come
partly from sensors [34,11], images [41,32,33] or
time series [40]. Feature mining consists of
synthesizing adequate features for CBR. For
instance, feature mining can involve reducing
the number of features in highly dimensional data,
such as the ones found in microarrays for bioinfor-
matics cases [31]. Another example is identifying
features from physiological signals [34]. From
textual records, finding the features among docu-
ments is another variant of feature mining.568- C
569
570Case mining: Mining for cases from existing data
sources will become more and more important,
particularly as the integration of CBR with electro-U
N
nic health records progresses. It consists of learning
cases by mining databases or datasets, sometimes
involving the consolidation of data from diverse
tables, records or other sources into a unified case
structure. Currently, few CBR systems take advan-
tage of this method, and this is why more research
is needed in this area. It is often noted by research-
ers that information about the diagnostic and/or
treatment process is not well recorded in patient
databases; the information is incomplete. With
electronic health records, a more comprehensive
view of patient problem situations becomes avail-
able to facilitate the case mining process. Here
again, mining for cases will often take the form of
text mining in progress notes.- SO
F
upport for the elderly and disabled: As the
population ages, these applications will grow in
number and significance. CBR researchers have
already tackled the problems of enabling inde-
pendent living for the elderly [37] and of providing
support for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease [21].
Many additional opportunities await.- A P
R
Occounting for the complexity of biomedicaldomains: Systems will tackle the growing massof information, in particular for quality control
andmonitoring [43,40], mixing their recommenda-
tions with probabilities and statistics, and taking
into account the co-occurrence of several ailments
[42]. One important focus will be how case-based
reasoning can associate probabilities and statistics
with its results, and how the two different meth-
odologies can complement one another.- LTE
Dife-long learning: CBR systems inmedicine shouldnot be designed only to reuse past episodes with
little modification. Medicine is a rapidly changing
field, andmedical practice guidelines are regularly
updated. Medications change, and new treatments
emerge constantly. Therefore, the recommenda-
tions for diagnosis, assessment and treatment that
were the norm5 years agomay today be obsolete in
part. The long-term follow-up CBR system [20]
should be designed as a life-long learning system,
integrating case base maintenance to propagate
new findings into the case base, or to take recent
developments into account at reuse time. Another
facet of this is to prioritize recent cases over old
cases when a choice is available.- Guidelines complementarity: The evolution of
medicine toward evidence-based practice is a
world-wide trend that will foster the development
of decision support in medicine. Clinicians are
supposed to keep updated in their knowledge of
recent guidelines in several medical domains,
eventually with assistance from software for dis-
seminating the state-of-the-art inmedical science.

6402because they provide the detailed context that is
generally lacking in the interpretationof guidelines
by computerized systems. They also provide some
common sense knowledge that is crucially missing
in expert systems. Another role envisioned for
cases is to generate hypotheses for amending the
guidelines from clinical practice, either comple-
menting guidelineswhere there are gaps or refining
the interpretation context, or evenproviding alter-
nate courses of action and ideas for improving
future guidelines.6413- DC

667ata mining for CBR: CBR systems implement a
variety of data-mining tasks and methods such as
classification. MNAOMIA [25] proposed to go one
step further by using the memory structures
learned during CBR to perform a data-mining
task as a side effect of case-based reasoning
to assist the diagnosis and treatment tasks.
The memory structures learned were called con-
cepts, or trends, because they synthesized infor-
mation common to sub-hierarchies of concepts
and cases in the memory. When this declarative
type of learning occurs, data mining can be
added as a complement to CBR, as a meta-level
technique capable of answering such questions
from clinicians as ‘‘What has your system
learned?’’ and eventually providing clinicians
with research hypotheses. A particular form of
data mining of interest for CBR systems would be
prototype mining. Many CBR systems use some
kind of prototypical cases, variously known as
prototypes, classes or abstract cases. These enti-
ties could be mined from cases, and may again be
of interest to clinicians in addition to being of
value for CBR.
4.2. Pitfalls along the way
Biomedicine is certainly a domain with many pitfalls
and puzzling aspects. Among themain ones that may
hinder the development of CBR in the health
sciences are the following: E
668
669- L
670
671R
Regal issues: Legal issues surrounding patient datarestrict access to medical data and require
advanced methods for data protection. Related
to this are the issues of safety [16] and medical
responsibility with regard to using computer-
based systems in decision support.- R
672
673
674
675
676
677C
Oeliance on biostatistics over other computa-
tional methods: In the medical field, statistics
add a scientific dimension to clinical research.
Complementary connections between statistics
and CBR should be made to ensure acceptance
of CBR among clinicians.U
N
- Building medical knowledge bases is a long pro-
cess, for which the availability of practice guide-
lines and their computerization provides a starting
point. Future case-based reasoning systems will
have to co-operate with one another and with
other methodologies in order to grasp the vastness
of this specialized knowledge.- Differential diagnosis. Medical diagnosis involves
providing a network and ranking of underlying
causes accounting for exhibited symptoms. This
again links to statistical considerations and the
ability to connect different computerized systems
with one another.TE

5. Summary and conclusion
This paper has described the current state of the art
in case-based reasoning in the health sciences,
projected future opportunities and challenges,
and warned of potential pitfalls. Current research
is marked by its richness, with its wide range of
application domains and its integration with numer-
ous complementary approaches and technologies.
Opportunities abound, including new contributions
to bioinformatics, support for the elderly and dis-
abled, formalization of CBR in biomedicine, feature
and case mining, and ultimately the development of
systems better designed to account for the complex-
ity of biomedicine and to integrate them into clin-
ical settings.
This paper grew out of work presented and dis-
cussions generated at two international workshops
on case-based reasoning in the health sciences. A
third workshop will be held at the Sixth Interna-
tional Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR-
05) to build upon progress made to date. As
researchers join together to exploit the opportu-
nities, while avoiding the pitfalls, CBR will find an
even more fruitful niche in the health sciences.Acknowledgments
