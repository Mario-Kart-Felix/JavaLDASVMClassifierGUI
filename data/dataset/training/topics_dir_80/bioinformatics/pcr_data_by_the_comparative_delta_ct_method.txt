Two different methods of presenting quantitative gene expression exist: absolute and relative quantification. Absolute quantification
calculates the copy number of the gene usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative gene expression presents the
data of the gene of interest relative to some calibrator or internal control gene. A widely used method to present relative gene
expression is the comparative CT method also referred to as the 2
DDCT method. This protocol provides an overview of the comparative
CT method for quantitative gene expression studies. Also presented here are various examples to present quantitative gene expression
data using this method.
INTRODUCTION
Quantifying gene expression levels has become a staple of most
molecular biological laboratories. By measuring the amount of
cellular RNA, one is able to determine to what extent that particular
gene is being expressed. For many genes, the expression levels
change dramatically from gene to gene, cell to cell or during various
experimental conditions. Some examples of quantitative gene
expression studies include: as a validation of protein levels1; as a
validation of the extent of transcription of a gene2; to study the
difference in expression of a gene in the diseased state compared to
the normal state3; change in gene expression during cell differentia-
tion or development4; change in expression for cells that are
exposed to a chemical substance (e.g., drug, toxin, hormone or
cytokine)5; quantification of noncoding RNA gene expression6; to
validate the effectiveness of small interfering RNA7 or antisense
oligonucleotides8; and as a diagnostic tool9.
Real-time RT-PCR is a powerful tool to quantify gene expression.
The quantitative endpoint for real-time PCR is the threshold cycle
(CT). The CT is defined as the PCR cycle at which the fluorescent
signal of the reporter dye crosses an arbitrarily placed threshold
(Fig. 1). By presenting data as the CT, one ensures that the PCR is in
the exponential phase of amplification. The numerical value of the
CT is inversely related to the amount of amplicon in the reaction
(i.e., the lower the CT, the greater the amount of amplicon).
There are several methods of reporting real-time PCR data
including presentation of real-time PCR data as absolute or relative
expression levels. Absolute expression provides the exact copy
number following transformation of the data via a standard
curve10. The data are typically presented as copy number per cell.
In relative quantification, the real-time PCR data is presented
relative to another gene often referred to as an internal control.
Absolute quantification is required when a precise quantity of
amplicon is desired, for example, calculation of viral load11. The
disadvantage of absolute quantification includes the increased
effort to generate standard curves. Furthermore, it is often unne-
cessary to present data as absolute copy number and relative
expression will suffice. For example, if a treatment increases the
expression of a particular gene from 10,000 to 50,000 copies per
cell, reporting the data as a fivefold increase in gene expression is
sufficient.
Several methods have been developed over the years to present
the relative gene expression. The efficiency correction method
calculates the relative expression ratio from the real-time PCR
efficiencies and the CT (ref. 12). Real-time PCR data has been
analyzed using the so-called sigmoidal curve fitting methods that fit
the experimental data to an empirical equation and results in the
prediction of the PCR efficiency and an estimate of the initial copy
number of the amplicon13,14. Another method of presenting
quantitative real-time PCR data is the comparative CT method
(also known as the 2DDCT method)15. The comparative CT method
makes several assumptions, including that the efficiency of the PCR
is close to 1 and the PCR efficiency of the target gene is similar to
the internal control gene15.
There are advantages and disadvantages to each of the methods
to analyze relative real-time PCR data. An advantage of the
efficiency correction method12 is that the PCR efficiency of the
target and internal control genes are included in the equation and
therefore differences in the efficiency between target and internal
control will be accounted for in the calculation. The sigmoidal

a typical real-time PCR output. The PCR was run for 40 cycles. The point at
which the curve intersects the threshold (horizontal red line) is the CT.
The CT in this example is 22.5.

curve fitting models13,14 have the advantage that PCR efficiency
does not need to be calculated by a separate experiment and is
estimated during the analysis. Advantages of the comparative CT
method include ease of use and the ability to present data as ‘fold
change’ in expression. Disadvantages of the comparative CT meth-
od include the assumptions of PCR efficiency must hold or the
PCR must be further optimized. Disadvantages of the simulated
kinetic model include the use of nonlinear regression analysis for
the calculations. In addition, it was recently shown that issues
relating to fitting the portion of the curve where the fluorescence
signal is hidden in the noise band may account for biased estimates
of the amplification efficiency16. A disadvantage of the efficiency
correction method includes that the efficiency of the target and
control genes must be determined for each experiment. This is
impractical when profiling many hundreds of genes by real-time
PCR (see Gene expression profiling).
Eq. 1 shows the final form of the 2DDCT equation, the derivation
of which has been reported previously in Applied Biosystems User
Bulletin No. 2 (P/N 4303859) and ref. 15.
Fold change ¼ 2DDCT ð1Þ
This form of the equation may be used to compare the gene
expression in two different samples (sample A and sample B); each
sample is related to an internal control gene. Sample A may be the
treated sample and sample B, the untreated control; sample A may
be the diseased state and sample B, the normal state or sample A is
infected with virus and sample B is not. Expanding Eq. 1 to its full
form:
2DDCT ¼½ðCT gene of interest  CT internal controlÞsample A
 ðCT gene of interest  CT internal controlÞsample BÞ
ð2Þ
It does not matter which DCT is placed first and which is placed
second in Eq. 2, however, the order affects how the results are
interpreted. We recommend calling the untreated control or
normal (i.e., not diseased), the calibrator or sample B. In this
way the data may be interpreted as ‘the expression of the gene of
interest relative to the internal control in the treated sample
compared with the untreated control’.
Most real-time PCR instruments are equipped with either a
96- or 384-well plate configuration. Thus, real-time PCR may be
used as a ‘low-density array’. Although PCR will never generate the
throughput that is achieved by cDNA microarrays, PCR has the
advantage of unparalleled sensitivity. Situations exist where one
may want to profile several hundreds of genes and for this reason,
real-time PCR is ideal. One application is microRNA (miRNA).
There presently exists some 530 human and 440 mouse miRNAs17.
Profiling the mature miRNA using real-time PCR configured in
384-well reaction plates and an assay such as the TaqMan miRNA
assays10 is a convenient method to generate high-quality data on
several hundreds of miRNAs. Another example is to make low-
density arrays of certain classes of genes (e.g., apoptosis, cell cycle
regulation, particular signal transduction pathway). Following the
experiment, one may study the expression of various genes within a
particular pathway.
Another issue that comes to mind when performing gene
expression profiling using real-time PCR is how best to present
the data. Most often in gene expression profiling experiments
the data are presented as a heatmap18. The heatmap allows
one to visualize hundreds of data points on a single figure.
Data presented as heatmaps are presented as individual data
points. When real-time PCR data is to be presented as individual
data points it should be presented as 2DCT or 2CT rather than
the raw CT value
15. When presenting the data from gene expres-
sion profiling studies, one would always want to normalize the
data to an internal control, so in this case the 2DCT is appropriate
where DCT ¼ (CT gene of interest  CT internal control).
Heatmaps generally undergo a log transformation. Therefore it
is not necessary to use the 2DCT data and the DCT data
will suffice.
A common question that arises regarding CT data is how to
perform calculations using the CT and more importantly how to
obtain the mean ± s.d. in order to perform statistical analysis.
Quantitative gene expression using real-time PCR will almost
always rely on PCR replicates (typically two to four PCR replicates
per cDNA sample). Although there are several different approaches
that could be taken, we recommend the following: (i) begin the
analysis by taking the mean of these PCR replicates and (ii) then
take the mean of the individual samples. It should be emphasized
that statistical tests should not be run on the raw CT data and
s.d. should always be calculated after the 2DDCT , 2DCT or 2CT
transformation has been performed (see Example 5 in ANTICI-
PATED RESULTS).
The comparative CT method has been widely used by
scientists19–21. The purpose of this protocol is to provide an
overview of the comparative CT method. In addition, we report
various tricks and tips that we have learned when using this method
to present real-time PCR data. A number of examples of the
calculations using the comparative CT method are provided.
Finally, some applications of the method that was not previously
reported in our original article15 including presentation of gene
expression profiling data have been added.

BOX 1 | ISOLATION OF RNA FROM CULTURED CELLS OR BLOOD
With the exception of Step 5, the protocol for isolating RNA is identical to that described in the Trizol protocol.
1. Remove cells from the 80 1C freezer and place the tubes on dry ice to prevent thawing.
2. Remove one sample from the dry ice and add 1 ml Trizol. It is not necessary to thaw the cells before adding the Trizol.
3. Lyse the cells using a P-1000 pipettor by repeated pipetting until the solution is homogeneous. Incubate at room temperature (20–24 1C)
for 5 min.
4. Add 200 ml chloroform, shake by hand 15 times and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.
5. Transfer the mixture to a 2-ml Eppendorf phase lock tube.
6. Centrifuge the phase lock tube in the cold for 15 min at 12,000g. Remove the supernatant and place into a 1.5-ml colored, microcentrifuge
tube. Colored tubes will enhance visualizing the RNA pellet.
7. Add 500 ml of isopropanol and precipitate the RNA for 10 min at room temperature. This is a good stopping point. If necessary, the samples
may be placed in the 20 1C freezer overnight.
8. Place the tubes in a microcentrifuge in the cold. Orient the caps to the outside of the centrifuge’s rotor. Centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000g.
The RNA pellet should be visible at the bottom of the tube on the side that was oriented to the rotor’s outside.
9. Decant the supernatant into a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube. It is not necessary to remove all of the supernatant. Add 1,000 ml of 75%
ethanol. Centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500g in the cold.
10. Decant the supernatant into the same 2-ml microcentrifuge tube used for the isopropanol. Briefly spin the tube containing the RNA for
several seconds to bring the residual ethanol to the bottom of the tube.
11. Using a pipette, remove most of the residual ethanol, being careful not to disturb the pellet. To remove the remaining ethanol, place the
tubes into a dessicator containing a porcelain platform filled with Drierite. Connect to house vacuum for 5 min. It is not necessary to
completely dry the sample because the residual water will not affect the reverse transcription step.
12. Dissolve the RNA pellet in 30–50 ml of molecular biology grade water and place the tubes on ice. RNA may be stored at80 1C; however, it
is recommended that RNA be converted to cDNA on the same day of the isolation.
BOX 2 | DNase TREATMENT
1. Briefly treat the RNA with RNase-free DNase to remove any residual genomic DNA that may be present in the RNA. Prepare the DNase
master mix accounting for 1–2 additional reactions.
Ingredient Per reaction (ll) For x reactions (ll)
RNase-free DNase I (10 U ml1) 1.8 x  1.8
RNA guard 0.3 x  0.3
25 mM MgCl2 2.4 x  2.4
Total 4.5 x  4.5
2. Add 1.2 mg of RNA, 4.5 ml of master mix and water to 30 ml into 200-ml PCR strip tubes.
3. Mix by gentle flicking, and briefly spin on a minicentrifuge that can handle strip tubes. Using a PCR Thermal Cycler, incubate at 37 1C for
10 min and then 90 1C for 5 min to inactivate the DNase.

6| Select the appropriate internal control gene for your experiment. Possible examples include 18S rRNA, 7S rRNA, U6 RNA,
b actin, GAPDH or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).
7| Present the real-time PCR data from the replicate cDNAs of the potential internal control genes as 2CT (Box 6).
8| Perform a Student’s t-test on the data to determine whether the expression of the internal control gene varies under the
experimental conditions.
9| See Example 3 in the ANTICIPATED RESULTS for a hypothetical example to determine whether a gene is suitable for use as
an internal control in a drug treatment experiment.
10| Decide which equations to use to analyze your data. If you are comparing the gene expression in one sample to
another (e.g., cells treated with ciplatin versus untreated cells5), then use the equations for the 2DDCT method described

5. The resulting cDNA may be analyzed immediately by real-time PCR or stored at 20 or 80 1C.
BOX 4 | REAL-TIME PCR
1. Perform triplicate PCRs per gene, per cDNA sample.
2. Prepare the following master mix, accounting for one to two additional reactions per gene.

3. Dilute the cDNA 1:50 or 1:100 by first placing molecular biology grade water into a disposable sterile basin. Add 99 ml of the water into the
PCR strip tube using a multichannel pipette.
4. Add 1 ml of cDNA to the labeled strip tubes using a multichannel pipette (e.g., Rainin L8-10). Use a multichannel pipette (e.g., Rainin
L8-200) to mix the solution 20 times. For efficient mixing, set the pipette at 75% of the solution’s volume (75 ml in this example).
5. Recap the undiluted cDNA with new strip caps to prevent cross-contamination.
6. Use a fine tip marker to mark the plate to the location of the different master mixes.
7. Use the repeating pipette (Rainin, E12-20) to add 20 ml of master mix to each sample. Add one row at a time.
8. Add 5 ml of dilute cDNA to each of the wells using a multichannel pipette.
9. Add the optical adhesive cover and seal using the sealing tool. Perform a brief spin (up to 1,500 r.p.m.) on a centrifuge equipped with a
96-well plate adapter.
10. Perform PCR using the real-time instrument per the manufacturers’ protocol. Typically, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 1C and 60 s at 60 1C followed
by the thermal dissociation protocol for SYBR green detection.

in the INTRODUCTION. Situations where it would be advisable to modify this approach are (i) for the presentation of real-time
PCR data as individual data points (Box 6) or (ii) for the presentation of real-time PCR data generated from gene expression
profiling (continue to Step 11).
Gene expression profiling
11| Select the primers to amplify the genes of interest and internal control genes for the profiling experiment. Profiling
experiments may be performed in 96- or 384-well plates.
12| Perform Steps 1–8 in the general protocol.
13| Approximate the efficiencies of the different amplifications.
14| One of the issues that arises as the number of genes are increased is how would one calculate the PCR efficiency on so
many different genes? It is not practical to perform analysis like that presented in Box 5 on several hundreds of different genes.
15| In these situations, the PCR efficiency may be approximated by the shape of the PCR amplification plot. This type of
analysis should only be performed on the logarithmic PCR amplification plots and not the linear plots. Primers that produce a
nearly identically shaped reaction plot will be expected to have similar efficiency. On the contrary, those that do not produce a
similar shape may need to be redesigned or the PCR further optimized. See Figure 2 for an example.
16| Present the data as DCT and plot the heatmap as described18. An example is shown in Figure 3.

BOX 5 | DETERMINE THE PCR EFFICIENCY OF GENE OF INTEREST AND INTERNAL
CONTROL GENE
1. Make tenfold serial dilutions of cDNA and then amplify the cDNA using primers to both the gene of interest and internal control.
2. Plot the CT (y-axis) versus log cDNA dilution (x-axis). Determine the slope of the line.
3. PCR efficiency is then calculated by the equation m ¼  (1/log E), where m is the slope of the line and E is the efficiency23.
4. Although no hard and fast rules apply as to what makes the efficiency of the genes similar enough to use the comparative CT method, a rough
guide is that they should be within 10% of each other (1.8 to 2.2).
5. If one gene is outside of the 1.8 to 2.2 range, then the PCR conditions should be optimized until they are within 10% of 2. This may be
achieved by adjusting the primer and/or the MgCl2 concentrations in the reaction.
6. If the PCR efficiency is not optimized following adjustment of the PCR conditions, then it is recommended to design new primers.
BOX 6 | PRESENTATION OF REAL-TIME PCR DATA AS INDIVIDUAL DATA POINTS
The 2DDCT method described in the INTRODUCTION is not necessary in situations where the data from a real-time PCR experiment are to be
presented as individual data points or normalized individual data points. This is common during gene expression profiling, when one wants
to determine the variation in the measurements from replicate PCR runs or when determining whether the internal control gene varies under
the conditions of the experiment. In these situations, data may be presented either as 2DCT or 2CT. The normalized, individual data point
(e.g., 2DCT) is identical to the 2DDCT (Eq. 1); only the sample is not related to a calibrator (hence, only one DCT is present in the equation).
The 2CT form of the equation may be considered the non-normalized, individual data point. The only difference between 2DCT and 2CT is
whether one wants to include an internal control or not. Almost always the CT from a PCR should be compared to an internal control.
Exceptions include when one wants to determine whether the internal control gene changes during the experiment (Example 3 in
ANTICIPATED RESULTS) or to determine the variation in individual PCRs (see ref. 15 for an example).
NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL.3 NO.6 | 2008 | 1105
PROTOCOL
This is interpreted as the expression of HOXD10 mRNA was
increased by eightfold due to treatment. If the first DCT is
greater than the second DCT, then the value of 2DDCT will be
o1. This implies that there was a reduction in the expression
due to treatment. Taking the negative inverse of 2DDCT will
provide us with the fold change reduction in expression.
Example 2
The mean CT of the HOXD10 gene in treated and untreated
samples was 26.5 and 24.9, respectively. The mean CT of the
18S rRNA internal control in the treated and untreated samples
was 9.7 and 9.9, respectively. What is the fold change in
expression of the HOXD10 gene due to treatment?
Fold change due to treatment ¼ 2DDCT
¼ 2 ð26:59:7Þ  ð24:99:9Þ½ 
¼ 0:287
Fold change due to treatment ¼ 1
0:287
¼ 3:5
This is interpreted as the expression of HOXD10 mRNA was
reduced by 3.5-fold due to treatment.
Example 3
The gene expression is to be compared in cell cultures that are treated with a hypothetical drug to those that are untreated.
The mean CT from replicate runs of an internal control gene are 27.2, 27.0 and 27.4 (treated samples) and 26.2, 26.3 and 26.0
(untreated samples). What is the fold change in expression of the internal control in the treated versus the untreated samples?
Does this gene serve as a useful internal control in this experiment? First calculate the mean CT values as 2
CT .

Figure 3 | Real-time PCR expression profiling of microRNA in pancreas tissue.
The expression of over 225 mature microRNAs was profiled in six normal
pancreases (norm) and nine pancreatic tumors using a real-time PCR assay.
The heatmap was generated by a log transformation of the real-time PCR data
presented as DCTðCT miRNA  CT 18S rRNAÞ.

Treated Untreated
2(27.2) ¼ 6.49E09 2(26.2) ¼ 1.30E08
2(27.0) ¼ 7.45E09 2(26.3) ¼ 1.21E08
2(27.4) ¼ 5.65E09 2(26.0) ¼ 1.49E08
Mean ¼ 6.53E09 Mean ¼ 1.33E08
The fold change in the internal control in the treated samples compared to the untreated sample is: 6.53E09/1.33E08 ¼ 0.490.
Drug treatment reduced the expression of the internal control by 2.04-fold so it would not make a good internal control gene.
Example 4
The expression of the BCL-2 and 18S rRNA genes were quantified in a group of 20 HER2 positive breast cancer patients and in
20 HER2 negative breast cancer patients. What is the mean ± s.d. for the HER2 expression in each group? What is the difference
in the Bcl-2 expression in the HER2 positive compared with the HER2 negative patients?
Because these are different patient samples, there is no means to justify which HER2 positive sample is compared with which
HER2 negative sample and therefore the 2DDCT method cannot be used. It is best to calculate the mean ± s.d. for each group
as individual data points using
2DCT 2ðCT Bcl2CT 18S rRNAÞ
h i
:
The s.d. may be calculated from these data. If the mean ± s.d. 2DCT (HER2 positive group) is 1.03  106 ± 9.87  108 and
the mean ± s.d. 2DCT (HER2 negative group) is 2.06  108 ± 2.43  109, then the difference in the Bcl-2 expression in
the HER2 positive compared with the HER2 negative patients is 1.03  106/2.06  108 or 50-fold. A Student’s t-test may
also be performed on the data to determine whether the difference is statistically significant.
Example 5
As another example, let us assume that three mice were treated with an experimental drug and three mice were untreated. cDNA
was synthesized from the livers of each mouse and triplicate PCRs were performed on each sample of cDNA. The mean CT
(treated mice) from the triplicate PCRs for the target and internal control gene are 27.2, 28.0, 27.8 (target gene) and 24.2,
24.7 and 24.9 (internal control gene). The mean CT (untreated mice) from the triplicate PCRs for the target and internal control
gene are 22.8, 23.0, 22.4 (target gene) and 24.8, 25.0 and 24.7 (internal control gene). What are the mean ± s.d. and the
coefficient of variation (CV) for the relative amount of target gene in both groups of mice? What is the difference in expression
of the target gene in the liver of the treated mice compared to the untreated mice?
Using the 2DCT method gives:
Treated mice Untreated mice
2(27.2–24.2) ¼ 0.125 2(22.8–24.8) ¼ 4.00
2 (28.0–24.7) ¼ 0.102 2(23.0–25.0) ¼ 4.00
2(27.8–24.9) ¼ 0.134 2(22.4–24.7) ¼ 4.92
The mean ± s.d. (CV) is: 0.120 ± 0.0168 (13.9%) (treated mice). The mean ± s.d. (CV) is: 4.31 ± 0.534 (12.4%) (untreated
mice). The fold change in expression between the treated and untreated mice is: 0.120/4.31 ¼ 0.0278; fold change due to
treatment ¼ 1/0.0278 ¼ 35.9.
An example to approximate the PCR efficiencies from reactions using multiple genes is shown in Figure 2. In this example,
the expression of 366 different genes was profiled in the identical sample of cDNA. As one can see from the figure, the shapes of
the amplification plots are similar to one another, in particular the slope of the geometric phase of amplification, suggesting
that the PCR efficiencies are approximately the same. An example of gene expression profiling data that was generated using
real-time PCR is shown in Figure 3. This particular data set is the expression of over 225 mature miRNAs that were profiling
using the TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems)10. The DCT data was used in this example to generate the heatmap.
Conclusion
Real-time quantitative PCR has become a staple of most biologically oriented laboratories. Some investigators are often
mystified as to how one deals with the data generated from real-time PCR experiments. The comparative CT method is a widely
used method to present real-time PCR data. Using some of the tricks, tips and examples presented here will hopefully demystify
the method and allow more investigators to successfully use it for analyzing real-time PCR data.
