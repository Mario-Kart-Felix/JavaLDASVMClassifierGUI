Abstract
Euglena gracilis is a major component of the aquatic ecosystem and 
together with closely related species, is ubiquitous worldwide. Euglenoids 
are an important group of protists, possessing a secondarily acquired plas-
tid and are relatives to the Kinetoplastidae, which themselves have global 
impact as disease agents. To understand the biology of E. gracilis, as well 
as to provide further insight into the evolution and origins of the 
Kinetoplastidae, we embarked on sequencing the nuclear genome; the 
plastid and mitochondrial genomes are already in the public domain. 
Earlier studies suggested an extensive nuclear DNA content, with likely a 
high degree of repetitive sequence, together with significant extrachromo-
somal elements. To produce a list of coding sequences we have combined 
transcriptome data from both published and new sources, as well as 
embarked on de novo sequencing using a combination of 454, Illumina 
paired end libraries and long PacBio reads. Preliminary analysis suggests 
a surprisingly large genome approaching 2 Gbp, with a highly fragmented 
architecture and extensive repeat composition. Over 80% of the RNAseq 
reads from E. gracilis maps to the assembled genome sequence, which is 
comparable with the well assembled genomes of T. brucei and T. cruzi. In 
order to achieve this level of assembly we employed multiple informatics

7.1  Introduction
Euglena gracilis is a species of unicellular 
green flagellate inhabiting aquatic ecosys-
tems (Buetow 1982). These photosynthetic 
organisms were first discovered by Anton van 
Leeuwenhoek in 1674 due to their locomotory 
movement, now known as metaboly (Dobell 
1932), and were further described by Ehrenberg 
in 1830 who established the genus to accom-
modate those euglenoid organisms that have 
eyespots. They are photosynthetic, as well as 
heterotrophic (Buetow 1982). They are freeliv-
ing, possess an eyespot, a food vacuole and two 
flagella—one short and one long, which play 
both locomotory and sensory functions (Rosati 
et al. 1991). They also possess a chloroplast 
which arose as a result of secondary endosymbi-
osis (Gibbs 1978; McFadden 2001). Euglenoids 
belong to the supergroup Excavata, and are 
distantly related to the kinetoplastids, which 
include Trypanosoma and Leishmania (see Adl 
et al. 2012 for a detailed review), important 
pathogenic protists about which there is consid-
erable understanding.
Whilst the taxonomic position of E. gracilis 
was debated for nearly a century it has recently 
been resolved (Adl et al. 2005). Euglenids are 
believed to hold significant importance in the 
evolutionary history of eukaryotes, particularly 
due to their position in the eukaryotic tree of 
life, and their secondary endosymbiotic history, 
which likely involves both a green and red/
brown algae contribution (Weigert et al. 2012). 
However, the absence of extensive molecular 
sequence data has made understanding this pro-
cess difficult. The presence of the secondary 
endosymbiont suggests that the E. gracilis 
genome is particularly chimeric as contributions 
from multiple lineages are likely present; at 
least two algae, a proteobacterium (mitochon-
drion) and an archaea host. Again, whilst this 
chimeric aspect may be a contributory factor to 
their resilience and metabolic flexibility, and 
specifically their ability to withstand extreme 
acidic and basic conditions and high concentra-
tions of heavy metals, the absence of a full gene 
complement precludes the full understanding of 
the scope of chimericism and the relative contri-
butions of these endosymbiotic- derived genes to 
this metabolic potential (dos Santos Ferreira 
et al. 2007). Euglena are also of relevance in 
biotechnology applications due to their exten-
sive synthesis of a wide range of natural prod-
ucts (O’Neill et al. 2015).
Many species of the genus Euglena are known, 
and these have a broad range of morphologies 
and ecological niches (Kim et al. 1998). E. gracilis 
is the most widely studied, due to both ubiquity 
within the biosphere and ease of culture. Over 
many years, multiple strains have been isolated 
and include, amongst others, the Z strain and bac-
illarus (Kim et al. 1998; Gojdics 1953; Zakryś 
1986; Zakrys and Walne 1994). The complex and 
divergent biology makes this unique organism an 
important model (dos Santos Ferreira et al. 2007), 
but popularity declined due to the absence of 
genome data and a means for genetic manipula-
tion. Notwithstanding this, some aspects of the 
biology of E. gracilis continued to gain signifi-
cant attention as widely reported by a constant 
stream of publications. The application of 
Euglena to biotechnology remains to be fully 
explored, since little is known about genetically-
encoded metabolic capacity beyond a recent 
T.E. Ebenezer et al.
127
report (O’Neill et al. 2015). The E. gracilis 
genomic and transcriptomic architecture contains 
evidence of endosymbiotic origins and the 
genome is comprised of Euglena- specific genes, 
genes shared with the kinetoplastida, green and 
red algae-derived genes, and pan-eukaryotic 
genes, which are inherited from the archaea 
ancestor of eukaryotes.
7.2  Estimating the Size 
of the Euglena Genome
The DNA of E. gracilis is distributed between 
three compartments, specifically nucleus, chloro-
plast and mitochondrion (Richards 1967). Early 
work demonstrated that the composition of DNA 
associated with these organelles had distinctive 
base compositions and different buoyant densities 
in CsCl gradients (Richards 1967). The nuclear 
DNA comprises ~95% of the cellular DNA in 
E. gracilis, with the chloroplast and mitochondria 
contributing the remaining 5% (Rawson 1975). 
The arrangement, size and composition of the 
E. gracilis genome have been rather difficult to 
 estimate (Fig. 7.1). The number of chromosomes 
in E. gracilis has also been somewhat contentious 
for over half a century, with estimates varying 
between four (O’Donnell 1965) and 45 (Leedale 
1958a, b). Recently, Dooijes et al. 2000 estimated 
the presence of at least 42 linear chromosomes 
using light microscopy of mitotic cells, and this 
value is very close to the number proposed by 
Leedale (1958a, b). What this may represent in 
terms of gene  expression or genome organisation 
is unclear; for example chromosome number 
amongst the related trypanosomatids is highly 
variable, ranging from 11 in T. brucei (Berriman 
et al. 2005) to 36 in Leishmania major (Ivens 
et al. 2005), and 41 in T. cruzi (Souza et al. 2011). 
Significantly, the arrangement of genes within 
polycistronic transcription units is strongly con-
served between kinetoplastid species (synteny) 
and this has recently been demonstrated to extend 
to Bodo saltans (Jackson et al. 2016). It will be of 
interest to determine if E. gracilis also retains 
some level of higher order gene organisation that 
is similar to that in the kinetoplastids.

(1983), and Ebenezer et al. (2017)
7 E. gracilis Genome Assembly
128
In addition to the uncertainty concerning 
chromosome number, the size of the nuclear 
genome remains unknown, with estimates vary-
ing by an order of magnitude. For instance, 
Zakrys (1988), determined the nuclear DNA lev-
els for 71 strains and 10 species of Euglena, 
including E. viridis, E. mutabilis, and E. gracilis 
using the cytophotometric method. It was esti-
mated that the nuclear DNA of Euglena ranges 
from 3 pg in E. mutabilis and E. pisciformis to 
24 pg in E. granulata. In the most widely studied 
species, E. gracilis, estimated DNA levels varied 
between 3.25 and 4.4 pg. According to Dolezel 
et al. (2003), since the mass conversion of DNA is 
1 Gbp ≈ 1 pg, this suggests that the nuclear 
genome of Euglena ranges from 3 Gbp in E. muta-
bilis and E. pisciformis to 24 Gbp in E. granulata, 
and more specifically, up to 4.4 Gbp in E. gracilis 
(Fig. 7.1).
It is also believed that the genomic DNA of E. 
gracilis is highly repetitive. For instance, Cook and 
Roxby (1985) characterized the small circular 
extrachromosomal DNA of E. gracilis as having a 
contour length of 11.3 kb, with a consistent restric-
tion map. They found that this makes up 0.5% of the 
total cellular DNA, i.e. about 0.015 pg/cell, and 
with a copy number of 1000 per cell. Their experi-
ments also suggest that the cellular DNA of E. grac-
ilis is 3 pg, i.e. 3 Gbp, in broad agreement with other 
estimations. Similarly, other reports are consistent 
with the DNA values for E. gracilis within the 
ranges: 3.0 and 4.5 pg/cell (Cook 1981), 3 pg 
(Rawson 1975) and three times calf thymus DNA 
(Mazus et al. 1984; Stankiewicz et al. 1983), which 
provides a high end estimate of 9 Gbp (Fig. 7.1). In 
a study to analyse the DNA of E. gracilis for the 
presence of baseJ and by comparison with the DNA 
of T. brucei, Dooijes et al. (2000), found that T. bru-
cei has 30-fold less DNA per nucleus. Since the 
total size of the T. brucei haploid genome is ~35 Mb, 
the estimated genome size for E. gracilis following 
from these calculations would be ~1 Gbp.
In addition to considerable variation in nuclear 
genome size between species, exposure to different 
environments has been shown to lead to changes in 
genome content within a single species. For exam-
ple, nutrient starvation reduces the amount of DNA 
within a cell through changes in ploidy (Hill et al. 
1966; Cook 1972; Davis and Epstein 1971; Epstein 
and Allaway 1967; Leedale 1974; Lefort-Tran 
et al. 1987). In contrast, DNA content increases as 
zinc concentrations increase, significantly affecting 
the biosynthesis and function of all major chroma-
tin components, i.e. RNA polymerases, DNA and 
histones. The species strain as well as exposure to 
light has also been associated with an increase in 
DNA content (Cook 1972).
7.3  The Chloroplast Genome
The E. gracilis chloroplast genome has been fully 
sequenced and is 143 kbp (Hallick et al. 1993). 
The plastid genome of E. gracilis is highly asym-
metrical in composition and the circular chromo-
some is strongly biased as to which strand is 
coding. The plastid genome encodes 97 proteins 
and gene loci; 46 of these are protein-coding and 
51 are RNA-coding or ribosomal (one 16S, one 
23S, and one 5S rRNAs, 27 different tRNA spe-
cies, 11 ribosomal proteins of the 30S subunit, and 
10 ribosomal proteins of the 50S subunit), includ-
ing group II and III introns, and twintrons (introns 
within introns) (Hallick et al. 1993; Thompson 
et al. 1995). The 46 protein-coding genes encode 
four genes for elongation factor EF-Tu (transcrip-
tion and translation), 27 photosynthetic proteins 
(including PSI & II), five ORFs showing similarity 
to chloroplast genes of other plant and algal spe-
cies, and ten ORFs with unknown functions 
(Hallick et al. 1993). The 27 photosynthetic genes 
encode components of the thylakoid membranes, 
the chloroplast ATP synthase complex, and large 
subunit of the CO2- fixing enzyme, Ribulose-1,5-
bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Of these, 
five encode photosystem I polypeptides (desig-
nated psaA-C, J, M), ten encode photosystem II 
components (designated psbA-F, H-L), and two 
encode the cytochrome b6/f complex (petB, petG) 
(Hallick et al. 1993). The two strands of the 
E. gracilis chloroplast genome also differ in com-
positional properties, and codon usage bias 
(Morton 1999), and it has been proposed that this 
is due to selection to coordinate transcription and 
 replication (see Morton 1998, 1999; Hallick 
et al. 1993). The evolutionary transition from an 
T.E. Ebenezer et al.
129
endosymbiont to the plastid organelle was 
accompanied by loss of many genes and transfers 
to the host genome (Martin and Herrmann 1998). 
E. gracilis is not a typical representative photosyn-
thetic euglenoid due to the diversity within the lin-
eage, and is not closely related to the phagotrophic 
forms believed to have been the host for the endo-
symbiont, and therefore substantial diversity 
within the chloroplast genome may exist across 
the lineage (Wiegert et al. 2012). Consistent with 
the secondary acquisition of the chloroplast, the 
plastid of E. gracilis is surrounded by three mem-
branes (Bachvaroff et al. 2005; Yoon et al. 2002). 
However, the cellular mechanisms involved in the 
evolution of the protein import machineries into 
these membranes are still unclear since the majority 
of the plastid proteome, much like the mitochon-
drion, is encoded by the nuclear genome, and hence 
remains to be characterised (Bolte et al. 2009).
7.4  The Mitochondrial Genome
Spencer and Gray established the general architec-
ture of the E. gracilis mitochondrial genome: a lin-
ear fragment of heterogeneous size (modal size 
4 kb) bearing terminal repeats and many small, 
likely nonfunctional, protein and rRNA gene frag-
ments, suggesting extensive ongoing recombina-
tion (Spencer and Gray 2011). These authors 
subsequently suggested, based on electron micro-
scopic observations, that virtually all of the 
E. gracilis mitochondrial genome is in the form of 
small linear fragments of average length (0.9–1 μm), 
with estimated sizes of the mtDNA varying from 
~15 to 20 kbp to several hundred kbp (Spencer and 
Gray 2012). The mitochondrial (mt) genomes of the 
kinetoplastids, euglenids, and other members of 
the phylum Euglenozoa, exhibit radically differ-
ent modes of organization and expression, and 
gene fragmentation is a striking feature of both 
euglenid and diplonemid mtDNAs (see Flegontov 
et al. 2011 for an extensive review).
However, the complete mitochondrial genome 
sequence of E. gracilis was recently reported 
(Dobakova et al. 2015), and has a surprisingly 
small coding potential, possessing only seven 
protein-coding genes: three subunits of respiratory 
complex I (nad1, nad4, and nad5), one  subunit of 
complex III (cob), and three subunits of complex 
IV (cox1, cox2, and a highly divergent cox3). No 
genes encoding subunits of succinate:ubiquinone 
oxidoreductase (complex II) were found, similar 
to most animal and fungal mitochondrial DNAs 
(Gray and Doolittle 1982; Tzagoloff and Myers 
1986; Attardi and Schatz 1988; Burger et al. 
1996). The seven mitochondrial encoded genes 
are located on six contigs: one gene per contig 
(Dobakova et al. 2015) except cox2 and cox3 as 
closely spaced genes on a single contig (Spencer 
and Gray 2011; Dobakova et al. 2015). The mito-
chondria DNA size ranges from 5 to 8 kbp and 
represents one of the smallest mitochondrial 
genomes known in terms of gene content. Genes 
encoding subunits of complex V (all atp genes; 
subunits of ATP synthase), ribosomal proteins and 
tRNAs are absent from the mitochondria genome, 
and these are thus likely located in the nuclear 
genome (Dobakova et al. 2015). Generally, the 
gene complement is reduced, even when com-
pared with the sister groups Diplonema and 
Kinetoplasta. The mitochondrion of E. gracilis is 
a facultative anaerobic organelle that produces 
ATP in the presence and absence of O2. Unlike 
the mitochondria of most eukaryotes, which have 
a pyruvate dehydrogenase multi-enzyme com-
plex, the mitochondrion of E. gracilis has an 
unusual O2- sensitive enzyme for the oxidative 
decarboxylation of pyruvate (i.e. pyruvate: 
NADP1 oxidoreductase) to produce acetyl-CoA 
(Nakazawa et al. 2000).
7.5  Genome Assembly Strategy; 
Finding the Right Pathway
Initial efforts towards sequencing Euglena rapidly 
encountered two significant challenges—the phys-
ical size of the genome and the high frequency of 
repetitive sequences. An initial attempt, with now 
obsolete 454 sequencing, highlighted the large 
genome size, and whilst this data confirmed the 
published estimates, it did not provide a realistic 
size for the genome, beyond a probable size in 
excess of 1 Gb. Additional sequence data were 
obtained from extensive long and short read paired 
7 E. gracilis Genome Assembly
130
end Illumina next generation sequencing, together 
with the addition of PacBio long read data. 
Significantly PacBio was of limited utility due to 
the high error rate of current technology and the 
low coverage that was obtained. Below is sum-
marised our approach to a decent draft genome—
which required considerable data augmentation as 
well as a trial and error approach towards assem-
bly. In some instances these  pipelines deviated 
from the standard method of genome assembly. 
This approach to complex genomes has been high-
lighted by El-Metwally et al. (2013) as standard 
pipelines resulted in fragmented, discontiguous 
assemblies that contained few identifiable genes.
In the discriptions of the assemblies below we 
used two criteria to evaluate the quality of the 
assemblies produced. The first was the CEGMA 
score, i.e. the proportion of core eukaryotic genes 
(CEGs) that could be detected in the assembled 
nucleotide sequences. The second was the propor-
tion of the available RNAseq reads from the same 
species that could be mapped to the genome. Both 
metrics provide a proxy for the completeness of 
the gene content of the genome, the first from the 
perspective of expected highly conserved genes, 
the latter from the perspective of all genes that are 
transcribed under cell culture conditions. Together 
these measures encapsulate the ethos of our 
assembly strategy, to generate a resource that can 
be mined for functional and evolutionary studies, 
both of which require extensive gene catalogs that 
are as near complete as possible.
The initial draft genome, version 0.7b, used six 
read libraries with a total per base coverage of 
8.2X and a total physical coverage of 18.9X 
(Table 7.1). Assembling this version of the genome 
required a multi-step process following the stan-
dard process of quality control using the 
Trimmomatic algorithm (Bolger et al. 2014), de 
novo assembly using ALLPATHS-LG (Gnerre 
et al. 2011), with additional scaffolding using 
SSPACE (Boetzer et al. 2011), gapfilling using 
SGA (Simpson and Durbin 2011) and assembly 
post processing using Pilon (Walker et al. 2014). 
This produced an assembly with a scaffold N50 of 
11144 bp and a total of 257,242 scaffolds.

metrics (Gurevich et al. 2013), proportion of CEGs

T.E. Ebenezer et al.
131
(Parra et al. 2007), and proportion of de novo 
sequenced transcriptome read mapping suggested 
that this assembly genome was highly fragmented, 
containing only ~16% of CEGs (when about 80% 
were expected), and with only 51.9% of the tran-
scriptome reads mapping back to the genome, 
consistent with the poor CEG score.
To address this, we obtained additional 
Illumina read libraries (150 bp long 240 bp insert 
size paired end HiSeq2000 reads, 300 bp long 
560 bp insert size MiSeq reads, and 100 bp long 
40 kbp insert size illumina mate-pair reads). 
These additional read libraries were used to gen-
erate six further different de novo assemblies 
using a diverse set of assembly and post- assembly 
processing algorithms summarised in Fig.  7.2.
Each assembly started from the same input reads 
that had been quality trimmed and filtered for 
adaptor sequences using Trimmomatic (Bolger 
et al. 2014). The most surprising result was 
obtained when following the same pipeline as 
outlined for the initial draft assembly above. 
Here the addition of substantial extra read data 
resulted in an assembly with substantially poorer 
properties, comprising a shorter scaffold N50 
(6251 bp) and fewer scaffolds (n = 81,015) with 
only 12.2% of the transcriptome mapping to the 
genome. Despite significant efforts the precise 
reason for this reduction in quality was not dis-
covered and thus alternative assembly algorithms 
were evaluated, these comprised Platanus, 
DISCOVAR de novo and SGA.
The most successful strategy for assembly, as 
assessed by CEGMA score and the percentage of 
the RNAseq reads from the transcriptome that 
mapped to the assembly (Hornett and Wheat 
2012; O’Neil and Emrich 2013), utilised the 
Platanus assembler. Platanus is designed for 
large, heterozygous polyploid genomes. 
Assembling the quality controlled error corrected 
reads with Platanus followed by subsequent 
rounds of scaffolding with SSPACE and gapfill-
ing using SGA resulted in a de novo assembly 
with a scaffold N50 of 1441 bp, comprising 
2,595,470 scaffolds. Of note with this assembly 
was that 87% of the RNAseq reads from the tran-
scriptome could be successfully mapped to this 
genome assembly. Other assemblies using 
DISCOVAR de novo, ALLPATHS-LG, SGA, or 
combinations of all four produced assemblies 
with lower CEGMA scores and fewer mappable 
RNAseq reads (data not shown).

Assembly of the genome has been problem-
atic, and the precise reasons remain unclear. The 
most probable issues are a combination of a high 
level of repeat sequence, together with the very 
large size of the genome and polyploidy. This, 
combined with limited resources for sequencing 
data result in a significant computational chal-
lenge. Our strategy also highlighted difficulties 
inherent in de novo assembly using mainly short 
read data with a complex genome lacking any 
close relative suitable as a scaffold. The need for 
orthogonal quality control monitoring is also 
highly important and the simple statistics under-
pinning an assembly are of limited utility as they 
lack a relevant benchmark. More useful, and of 
high biological relevance for gene finding pur-
poses, are the ability to map transcripts and 
RNAseq reads and CEGMA analysis. These lat-
ter two were essential in determining the poor 
quality of several of the earlier assemblies, and 
this was not apparent from the output of the 
assemblers and quality control algorithms alone.
7.6  Assembling 
the Transcriptome
As a complimentary approach to the genome 
assembly, we also assembled a meta- 
transcriptome, based on data generously pro-
vided by Rob Field (O’Neill et al. 2015) together 
with additional data generated in house. The tran-
scriptome was considerably less challenging to 
assemble compared to the genome (Table 7.1), 
but also involved a multiple-step iterative proto-
col to achieve good levels of completion and con-
tiguity. Read data from all transcriptome projects 
were combined prior to de novo transcriptome 
assembly. Raw reads were subject to quality fil-
tering using Trimmomatic and searched for all 
common Illumina adaptors (the default option) 
and the settings used for read processing by trim-
momatic were LEADING:10 TRAILING:10 
SLIDINGWINDOW:5:15 MINLEN:50. The 
trimmed and quality filtered paired-end reads 
were then filtered to remove reads coming from 
ribosomal RNA using SortMeRNA with the 
default settings, before being subject to read error 
correction using BayesHammer with the default 
settings (Nikolenko et al. 2013). Reads were then 
digitally normalized using khmer with settings 
–C 20 -k 21 -M 8e9. Following normalization, 
overlapping paired- end reads were joined 
together using ALLPATHS-LG and all reads 
(joined and those that were unable to be joined) 
were subject to de novo assembly using SGA 
with a minimum overlap size of 80 nucleotides 
(with no mismatches). The assembled contigs 
were subject to four additional rounds of assem-
bly using SGA, each round reducing the overlap 
size by 10 nucleotides such that the last round of 
assembly was performed with an overlap size of 
40 (with no mismatches). The filtered, normal-
ized joined reads were then mapped to this 
assembly using Bowtie2. Reads that were absent 
from the assembly were identified and combined 
to the assembly file. The combined un-assembled 
reads and assembled contigs were subject to 
assembly using SGA with an overlap size of 70. 
This process of identifying unmapped reads and 
reassembling with SGA was repeated each time, 
decreasing the overlap size by 10 nucleotides 
until the final round of assembly was performed 
with an overlap size of 40 nucleotides. Contigs 
were then subjected to scaffolding using SSPACE 
and the full set of non-ribosomal, corrected, nor-
malized paired-end reads using the settings -k 10 
-a 0.7 -n 50 -o 20. Scaffolds were gap filled using 
the SGA gap filling function. Finally, the assem-
bled contigs were subject to base-error correction 
using Pilon with the default settings. CEGMA 
(Parra et al. 2007) suggests ~88% completeness.
7.7  A Preliminary Transcriptome 
and Genome Assembly 
for Euglena gracilis
Our preliminary analysis of the Euglena genome 
suggests an estimated size of ~1.4 giga bases 
(Table 7.1), with the majority of the sequence 
noncoding. Analysis of the transcripts, coding 
sequences and proteins/genes arising from the 
whole transcriptome suggests a combined sequence 
length of ~63 Mb, ~38 Mb, and 36,526 proteins 
respectively (Table 7.1). This is significantly larger 
T.E. Ebenezer et al.
133
than the genome and predicted proteomes of 
T. brucei, i.e. ~35 Mb arranged in 11 chromo-
somes and 9 Mb protein-coding sequence respec-
tively (Berriman et al. 2005; Jackson et al. 2010), 
or A. thaliana, with 135 Mb arranged in five chro-
mosomes and 35,386 protein-coding transcripts 
(Lamesch et al. 2012). Overall, we conclude that 
the transcriptome assembly is of high quality 
while the genome is of reasonable quality, but 
highly fragmented. The fragmentation is, perhaps, 
due to low read coverage combined with repeats, 
polyploidy, or near identical sequences which 
presents some assembling challenge to the algo-
rithms. There is a GC bias between the transcrip-
tome and the genome; with the transcriptome 
having a richer GC content (~60%), while the 
genome has a GC content of ~50%, suggesting 
the presence of significant AT-rich repeats in 
the genome.
7.8  The Tubulin and Calmodulin 
Genes
As preliminary candidates for interrogation of 
the genome and transcriptome we selected the 
tubulin and calmodulin gene families. Tubulin 
is a fundamental constituent of eukaryotic cyto-
skeletons, cell division machinery and motile 
organelles (Gull 2001), with most eukaryotes 
expressing multiple tubulin genes in specific 
regulatory or developmental contexts (Jackson 
et al. 2006). In general there are seven distinct 
subfamilies of tubulin that have been defined in 
eukaryotes, namely: alpha- (α-), beta- (β-), 
gamma- (ɣ-), epsilon- (ε-), delta- (δ-), zeta- 
(ζ-), and FtsZ, with an α/β heterodimer being 
the essential building block for the microtubu-
lar cytoskeleton, including kinetoplastids 
(McKean et al. 2001).
Representatives of all tubulin subfamilies (α-, 
β-, ɣ-, σ-, δ-, ζ-, and FtsZ-) were identified and 
classified in the E. gracilis transcriptome and 
genome using phylogenetic inference (FastTree 
and MrBayes). ɣ and FtsZ tubulin family were 
not found in the genome assembly, suggesting a 
lack of completeness (Fig. 7.3). In the E. gracilis 
transcriptome a single copy of all tubulins except 
σ-tubulin was found, which was unexpected in 
comparison to the multiple copies reported in 
many kinetoplastids. Overall, the E. gracilis 
tubulin sequences have good phylogentic support 
of ≥0.8 (Figs. 7.3 and 7.4) for subfamily assign-
ments and there are no indels in the predicted 
coding sequences. The tubulin genes however 
possess multiple intron types and include splice 
sites (GT/C-AG borders), intermediate splice 
sites (e.g. AT-AC borders), and nonconventional 
splice sites (non GT/C-AG or AT-AC borders) 
(Fig. 7.5) (for details on Euglenoid introns see 
Milanowski et al. 2014, 2016, and McWaters and 
Russell, this volume). Overall gene lengths in the 
transcriptome are similar to those previously 
reported (Schantz and Schantz 1989; Jackson 
et al. 2006; Levasseur et al. 1994; Milanowski 
et al. 2014, 2016; Canaday et al. 2001), but are 
considerably shorter in the genome owing to 
truncation and fragmentation.
Overall, 18 introns were identified in the 
tubulin genes. Five introns (two conventional 
i.e. GT-AG borders, two intermediate- 
nonconventional i.e. GG/TA-T/AG borders, and 
one nonconventional i.e. CC–AA borders) are 
present in β, five introns (four conventional i.e. 
GT/C-AG borders and one nonconventional i.e. 
CC–AA borders) in α, two introns (conventional 
with GT-AG borders) in σ, four introns (one con-
ventional i.e. GC-AG borders, one intermediate- 
nonconventional GG-AG borders, and two non 
conventional CC/GA–C/GG borders) in δ, and 
two introns (one conventional i.e. GT-AG 
borders and one intermediate-nonconventional 
i.e. GT-CG borders) in ζ, suggesting rather com-
plex splice site recognition and likely processing 
machinery.
The presence of all tubulin subfamilies sug-
gests conserved cytoskeletal function. It is not 
yet clear why there are single copies of tubulin 
subfamilies in E. gracilis, in contrast to many 
other kinetoplastids which possess arrays of 
tandem- duplicated tubulin genes (Jackson et al. 
2006). However, Trypanosome cruzi is also 
predicted to have only one β-tubulin gene, and 
hence this may well represent an assembly arti-
fact. Significantly, on phylogenetic reconstruc-
tion the Euglena α-, σ-, and FtsZ-tubulin families 
7 E. gracilis Genome Assembly
134
cluster with kinetoplastids, while the β- and 
ɣ-tubulins cluster with A. thaliana, which may 
suggest endosymbiotic gene transfer from the 
green algal endosymbiont but this prediction is 
very tentative.
Calmodulin (CaM) is an ubiquitous, calcium- 
binding protein that can bind and regulate a mul-
titude of different protein targets (McDowall 
2016). CaM mediates processes such as inflam-
mation, metabolism, apoptosis and muscle con-
traction in animals. In E. gracilis, one calmodulin 
is located beneath the pellicula may be involved 
in maintaining cell shape (Lonergan 1985) and 
responses to external stimuli such as light (photo-
taxis, see Chap. 11, this volume), oxygen pressure, 
gravity (gravitaxis, see Chap. 12, this volume) 
(Porterfield 1997; Streb et al. 2002; Hader et al. 
2005a, b; Daiker et al. 2010), and signal trans-
duction (Daiker et al. 2010). Calmodulin and 
protein kinases are involved in gravitaxis (Streb 
et al. 2002).Five types of CaM proteins have 
been discovered in E. gracilis and include: 
CaM.1, CaM.2, CaM.3, CaM.4, and CaM.5, with 
CaM.2 being implicated in gravitaxis (Toda et al. 
1992; Daiker et al. 2010). In general, CaMs con-
sist of ~150 amino acids and the molecule pos-
sesses four calcium binding sites (Aykut et al. 
2013), each motif consists of a 12-residue loop 
flanked on either side by a 12-residue α-helix 
(Kawasaki and Kretsinger 1995).

top left corner of the diagram depicts ζ-tubulin genes 
while larger tree depicts α-, β-, ɣ-, ε-, and δ-tubulin genes. 
In both instances, FtsZ tubulin family was used as the out-

respectively. Nodes without statistical support implies 
that this is above the threshold of ≥99/99. The numbers on 
the right of the tree, corresponding to specific taxa name, 
represent the copies of the tubulin sub family found in that 
taxa. Each clade correspond to each tubulin sub family 
and are classified as either α-, β-, ɣ-, ε-, δ-, ζ-, or FtsZ 
tubulin. Color codes: Green photosynthetic organisms,

7 E. gracilis Genome Assembly
136
We analysed the CaM family using the phylo-
genetic inference method to assign sequences to 
specific subfamilies. CaM.1-7 were not found in 
the genome, but one single copy was found in 
the transcriptome, which could not be classified 
with reliability. However, analysis does suggest 
a set of multiple copies of calmodulins as found 
in kinetoplastids (Fig. 7.6). This is not consistent 
with Daiker et al. (2010), who found the pres-
ence of five calmodulins (CaM.1-5) in E. graci-
lis. The absence of CaM.1-7 from the genome 
assembly is likely due to incompleteness. Forty-
four CaM- related potential calcium sensors 
(McCormack and Braam 2003) were also found 
in the E. gracilis transcriptome, while only 23 
were found in the genome. However, it is signifi-
cant that Euglena possesses a very large pre-
dicted cohort of these proteins, which are 
equalled only by multicellular plants and ani-
mals (Fig. 7.6). Overall, these data suggest a 
highly complex mechanism for the control of 
signal transduction and that CaM/CaM-related 
proteins likely have very important roles in the 
responses of E. gracilis to environmental and 
other cues, and which far exceeds the parasitic 
kinetoplastids and even the free-living B. saltans 
by a considerable degree.
7.9  Conclusions
A draft genome and transcriptome of E. gracilis 
are now available. Analysis indicates a close rela-
tionship to the kinetoplastids, as well as the 
expected presence of photosynthetic genes that 
likely were transfered with the secondary endo-
symbiosis. The genome is very large, confirming 
earlier estimates of an extremely high level of 
DNA content, and is highly repetitive, both of 
which contribute to the difficulty in arriving at a 
high quality genome. None the less, despite the 
fragmentary nature of the draft genome, a very 
high quality transcriptome could be assembled, 
and which has indicated the presence of large 
numbers of paralogs within the calmodulin and 
calmodulin-related gene cohort, as well as addi-
tional protein families not discussed here. 
Furthermore, we found evidence for extensive and 
divergent splicing within tubulin genes, which 
suggest complex mechanisms for the control of 
gene expression and environmental sensing. 
Whilst size, high frequency of repeats and several 
other features were all suspected from previous 
analyses, the availability of genome wide sequence 
data will allow very rapid progression in mapping 
the structure of Euglena gene families, their

 diversity and the origins of cohorts of proteins 
associated with photosynthesis as well as addi-
tional metabolic functions. With the draft genome 
and transcriptome of E. gracilis we anticipate a 
major step forward for the biology of this fascinat-
ing organism and in unravelling its contributions 
to ecology and exploitation for biotechnology.
