Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Degree Requirements 
Credits 
Students pursuing the doctoral degree in BCB must complete a minimum of 90 credits of 
relevant work beyond the bachelor’s degree; or a minimum of 60 credits beyond the M.S. degree 
if the student possesses a relevant M.S. degree in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, or a 
closely related field. 
For students proceeding directly from the B.S. degree to the Ph.D. degree, the 90 credits must be 
distributed as follows: 
         30 graduate credits in coursework, as described below; 
         30 graduate credits in BCB 699 Dissertation Research; and 
         30 graduate credits in additional coursework and additional research (BCB 699 Dissertation 
Research or BCB 597 Directed Research). 
 
For students with a relevant M.S. degree, the 60 credits must be distributed as follows: 
         30 graduate credits in BCB 699 Dissertation Research; and 
         30 graduate credits in coursework and additional research (BCB 699 Dissertation Research 
or BCB 597 Directed Research). Student must fulfill the Course Work Requirement 
described below. Student may substitute additional research work for course work 
requirements already fulfilled during their M.S. work, with the permission of the BCB 
program’s Review Committee. 
Course Work Requirement (30 credits) 
Students must take courses to satisfy each of the following requirements.  Only courses in which 
the student has obtained an A or a B grade can be used to satisfy this requirement. If a course is 
listed below as satisfying more than one requirement, a student can only count such course 
towards one of his/her course work requirements.  
1. Foundational knowledge (12 credits): All BCB Ph.D. students must gain core knowledge of 
biology, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and bioinformatics and computational 
biology.  To achieve this requirement, students must complete one 3-credit foundational 
course in each of these four areas.  To provide students with maximum flexibility in this fast-
moving field, students work with their Advisory Committee to determine the most relevant 
courses for their areas of interest.  For example, a student focusing on bioinformatics who is 
interested in studying the effects of mutations on protein interaction networks may take 
completely different courses from a student focusing on computational biology who is 
interested in developing computational simulations of ecological systems.

Courses chosen in consultation with the student’s Advisory Committee.  An elective can be 
any graduate course on the approved list for the BCB Ph.D. degree (see Appendix). Other 
graduate courses, graduate research credits, or ISGs may also be used with prior approval of 
the BCB program's Review Committee.  
Advisor and Advisory Committee Selection 
Upon acceptance to the doctoral program, students will be assigned a temporary Academic 
Advisor. In consultation with the Academic Advisor, the student must prepare a Plan of Study 
outlining the course selections and rotations that the student will pursue for the first year.  This 
Plan of Study must then be approved by the BCB program's Review Committee, which consists 
of faculty members from each of the three participating WPI departments.  
3 
 
Students are required to complete rotations with at least two program faculty members in the first 
year of the program (at least 2 credits each, BCB 597). A rotation is typically a semester-long 
research or laboratory experience conducted under the guidance of a faculty member affiliated 
with the BCB program. After completing his/her rotations, the student will ask one of the 
rotation faculty members to be their Advisor, replacing the temporary Academic Advisor.  
Students are encouraged to ask faculty from two different participating departments to co-advise 
their research.  In consultation with the Advisor(s), the student will select an Advisory 
Committee.  The Advisory Committee must be constituted as follows: 
 The Advisory Committee must consist of at least three members (four members if there are 
two co-Advisors). 
 At least two Advisory Committee members must be BCB affiliated faculty members from 
two different participating WPI departments (BBT, CS, MA).  
 At least one Advisory Committee member must be a full-time, WPI tenured / tenure-track 
faculty member. 
 At least one Advisory Committee member must be from outside the BCB program, or from 
outside of WPI.    
The Advisory Committee will meet with the student once per semester to monitor research and 
coursework progress. 
Research presentation skills 
Students are required to register for 1 credit per semester in the BCB seminar series (BCB 510 
BCB Seminar).  This series includes research seminars from invited external speakers as well as 
student presentations of their research.  Students must present a seminar on their work once each 
year.  In addition, all doctoral students are encouraged to present their research at appropriate 
professional conferences. 
Teaching and mentoring experience 
 
Recent studies show that teaching experience enhances graduate students’ research skills.  In 
addition, particularly for students preparing for academic careers, teaching and mentoring 
experience is an invaluable asset.  Thus, all BCB doctoral students must acquire teaching and 
mentoring experience.  Students may fulfill this requirement in one of several ways.  While at 
least one such experience is required, students are encouraged to pursue more than one teaching 
and mentoring opportunity during their graduate work. 
 
Students must choose at least one of the following options: 
 Work with a faculty member to design lectures, classroom activities, or problem sets, and to 
lead problem sessions or discussion sections for the students.  This experience may be 
fulfilled as part of a Teaching Assistantship, but is not fulfilled by simply acting as a grader 
for a course. Credit is obtained by registering for BB 556 Mentored teaching experience (1 
credit). 
 Work with a faculty member to mentor undergraduate students in a research project.   The 
undergraduate research project will typically be related to the graduate student’s research, 
4 
 
resulting in a vertical integration of the research experience for all of the students. Credit is 
obtained by registering for BB 556 Mentored teaching experience (1 credit). 
 Take a course related to teaching with prior advisor approval.  The Higher Education 
Consortium of Central Massachusetts (HECCMA) offers coursework that can lead to a 
Certificate in College Teaching. 
 
Graduate Internships 
Students will have the opportunity to undertake a Graduate Internship to fulfill credit toward 
their degree (BCB 589 Graduate Internship).  A graduate internship is carried out in cooperation 
with a sponsor or industrial partner. It must be overseen by a faculty member affiliated with the 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program.  The internship will involve development 
and practice of technical and professional skills and knowledge relevant to Bioinformatics and 
Computational Biology.  At the completion of the internship, the student will produce a written 
report, and will present his/her work to BCB faculty and internship sponsors. Students may use 
up to 6 coursework credits of BCB 589 Graduate Internship towards their Ph.D. degrees.  
Ph.D. Qualifying Examination 
The Qualifying Examination will be comprised of researching, writing, and defending a research 
proposal.  The student is required to successfully complete the Qualifying Examination no later 
than the first semester of his/her third year in the program. If the Qualifying Examination is 
successfully completed, the proposed work may constitute the basis of the student’s dissertation 
research.  
The student will present his/her research proposal publicly.  The student will then be examined 
privately by the Advisory Committee, who will assign the student one of four outcomes: 
 Fail, which results in dismissal from the BCB Ph.D. program. 
 Repeat, which requires the student to retake the examination within six months of the date of 
the initial Qualifying Examination.  Students may only Repeat once. 
 Pass with Conditions, which requires the student to complete additional work, such as 
coursework or independent study. 
 Pass. 
Dissertation Defense 
All Ph.D. students must produce and orally defend a dissertation.  The research must constitute a 
contribution to knowledge in the field of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and must be 
of publication quality.  Students must defend the dissertation orally in a public presentation, 
followed by a private defense to the Advisory Committee.   The Advisory Committee will assign 
the student one of three outcomes: 
 Fail, which results in dismissal from the BCB Ph.D. program. 
 Repeat, which requires the student to complete additional work, and repeat the defense.  
 Pass, with or without additional work and revisions to the document.

Admission 
Students applying to the doctoral degree program in BCB are expected to have a bachelor's or 
master’s degree in bioinformatics, biology, computer science, mathematics/statistics, or a related 
field, and to have taken introductory courses in each of the three disciplines of biology, computer 
science, and mathematics. For example, a student with a degree in biology is expected to have 
also completed basic coursework in programming, data structures, calculus, and statistics prior to 
submitting an application.   
All applicants are required to submit a Statement of Purpose. Applicants who are not WPI 
students or alumni must submit Graduate Record Exam (GRE) scores. GRE Subject tests in 
relevant disciplines are encouraged but not required. All other WPI graduate application 
requirements, including transcripts, letters of recommendation and TOEFL/IELTS, apply.
