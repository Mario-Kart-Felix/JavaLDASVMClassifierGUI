Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field, and educa-
tional programs for bioinformatics are increasing at a
similar pace to answer the demand for qualified profes-
sionals. Here we survey currently available bioinformat-
ics programs. We have compiled summaries of these
programs, including university, state, degree type, de-
partment, entrance requirements, degree requirements,
links to course Web pages, research interests, and fund-
ing. Complete details are presented in the Web version,
and an abbreviated listing of the primary attributes of all
programs is included in this article.
Background
Bioinformatics is a quickly expanding discipline. One
area of growth is in educational programs associated with
bioinformatics (Zauhar, 2001). A survey of programs in
bioinformatics serves two purposes: it provides a resource
for prospective students or faculty, and records the magni-
tude (number of programs) and growth (increase in the last
3 years) of bioinformatics programs. We electronically pub-
lished an initial survey (Hemminger, 2002a) in Fall 2002 in
association with a presentation (Hemminger, 2002b) at the
ASIS&T 2002 conference. Several other Web resources
have provided similar information, including the Interna-
tional Society of Computational Biology (ISCB; 2003), 123
Genomics (2003), the National Library of Medicine (2001),
Petersen’s Guide (2003), the University of Texas (1998),
BioQUEST (2003), and the Bio-IT World magazine
(Schachter, 2002). We updated our survey in February 2004
and present the results in this article.
Methods
In the emerging field of bioinformatics there is a debate
concerning whether bioinformatics should be a separate disci-
pline, or a subpart of other existing fields (Russell, 2003;
Stein, 2003). Bioinformatics programs commonly grow out of
different departments or schools within universities, much as
other new technology disciplines such as computer science
have in the past. Most commonly, these new programs are ini-
tially housed in biology, genetics, statistics, biomedical engi-
neering, or computer science departments, although we are
beginning to observe more stand-alone bioinformatics pro-
grams.
Because bioinformatics programs are mostly offered as
subprograms or specializations of existing programs, it can
be challenging to discover them. Programs are identified by
several terms (including bioinformatics, medical informat-
ics, informatics, health informatics, computational biology)
making it difficult to identify them with simple Web
searches. Furthermore, most programs have started in just
the last 3 years and have not been entered into a program
directory. To identify programs, we incorporated multiple
methods using different sources: Web pages at universities,
existing summaries, and e-mail queries of people working
in bioinformatics-related areas. We formed an initial list of
potential programs by searching Web pages and reviewing
existing summaries. We then investigated these programs in
detail, and removed programs from our list that did not meet
our selection criteria. After a preliminary list was prepared,
we published it on the Web, and solicited feedback from
people with a direct knowledge of the programs via postings
on newsgroups and listservs related to bioinformatics.
Searching Web Pages
We used Google (2003) to search Web pages for bioin-
formatics programs. Because bioinformatics programs are
sometimes listed under other “informatics” disciplines such
as medical informatics, we included “informatics” in our
search strings as well. We combined “bioinformatics” with
“program” for our initial search, which resulted in 311,000
hits. We tried adding four secondary terms (“university,” “de-
gree,” “health,” and “medical”) in addition to each of the two
base terms (“bioinformatics program” and “informatics pro-
gram”) to narrow the search scope to increase relevancy.
Lastly, we searched with “bioinformatics degree” (leaving
out program) to procure listings that did not use the term
“program.” Because the number of hits returned by these
Google searches was so large for most of our selections, we

only reviewed the most relevant returns (assuming that the
higher the Google ranking the more relevant). We initially in-
vested the most effort on the results of the basic term
searches, and then searched the basic terms in combinations
with the other four terms to look for new programs not cap-
tured in the initial searches. The searches and approximate
numbers of how many hits (initial Web pages) were reviewed
for each search are shown in Table 1. These searches were
performed during June and July 2003, and followed up in
February 2004.
Existing Reviews Utilized
Other lists of programs we reviewed and incorporated
sites from included the International Society of Computa-
tional Biology (ISCB; 2003), 123 Genomics (2003), the
National Library of Medicine (2001), Petersen’s Guide
(2003), the University of Texas (1998), BioQUEST (2003),
and the Bio-IT World magazine (Schachter, 2002; Toner,
2003) and our 2002 listing (Hemminger, 2002b).
Program Information Recorded
Each university or college’s program Web site was then
searched to find what degrees were offered by the institution,
location (state) of institution, what department or school the
program is under, entrance requirements, degree type(s) and
requirements, links to the Web page listing of courses in
the program, a sampling of the faculty’s research interests,
financial aid that is available, and any other pertinent infor-
mation found.
Program Inclusion Criteria
Once the program’s Web site had been located using the
methods noted above, certain criteria were applied to deter-
mine whether the program would be included in our list. Most
important was the presence of a degree or certificate granted
at the conclusion of the program that specifically mentioned
“informatics” in some variation. This meant some longstand-
ing programs, as well as large-scale or interdisciplinary pro-
grams, may not have been included. Also as a result, medical,
chemical, and biological informatics were all included while
many computational biology programs were excluded unless
they specifically mentioned an option or a track in bioinfor-
matics. We made every effort to discover all schools and
degrees that fit these requirements. Some Web pages corre-
sponded to defunct programs, programs in preparation, or pro-
grams not granting formal degrees for certificates. These
programs were not included unless commencement of the pro-
gram was scheduled for a stated date. Once these selection cri-
teria had been applied, we then compiled the results, formatted
them into an Excel document, and created an abbreviated ver-
sion in HTML and Word document formats for Web posting.
We also have begun compiling an associated list of the compu-
tational biology or biophysical mathematics programs that we
chose not to include (Hemminger, 2004a).
Feedback From Colleagues
Once the initial survey results were compiled, we placed
them online, and solicited feedback from people in the
field via newsgroups (bionet.biology.computational, bionet.
software, bionet.software.www, bionet.info-theory) and
e-mail listservs (asis-l@asis.org, bioinfo@listserv.unc.edu,
bioinformatics@labs.oreilly.com, bioinfo-sils@listserv.unc
.edu, sigbioinform-l@asis.org, sigmed-l@asis.org, sigsti-l
@asis .org). We reviewed all feedback, and updated the pro-
gram listing to its final form as summarized here.
Results
The complete listing of all our results can be found on the
Web as an Excel spreadsheet (Hemminger, 2004b). A more
concise version matching the Table 2 is maintained on the
Web as well (Hemminger, 2004c). The bioinformatics
degree-granting program summary information is updated
formally once a year, with occasional updates occurring
during the year. The Web addresses in the print version
of this article are not included because of space considera-
tions, and because of the frequent changes to Web pages
and addresses. Thus, the online version should be consulted
