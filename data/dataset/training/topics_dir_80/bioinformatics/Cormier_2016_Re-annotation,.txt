Summary	24 
• The genome of the filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus was the first to be completely 25 
sequenced from within the brown algal group and has served as a key reference genome both 26 
for this lineage and for the stramenopiles.  27 
• We present a complete structural and functional reannotation of the Ectocarpus genome.  28 
• The large-scale assembly of the Ectocarpus genome was significantly improved and genome-29 
wide gene re-annotation using extensive RNA-seq data improved the structure of 11,108 30 
existing protein-coding genes and added 2,030 new loci. A genome-wide analysis of splicing 31 
isoforms identified an average of 1.6 transcripts per locus. A large number of previously 32

undescribed non-coding genes were identified and annotated, including 717 loci that produce 33 
long non-coding RNAs. Conservation of lncRNAs between Ectocarpus and another brown 34 
alga, the kelp Saccharina japonica, suggests that at least a proportion of these loci serve a 35 
function. Finally, a large collection of SNP-based markers was developed for genetic analyses. 36 
These resources are available through an updated and improved genome database.  37 
• This study significantly improves the utility of the Ectocarpus genome as a high-quality 38 
reference for the study of many important aspects of brown algal biology and as a reference for 39 
genomic analyses across the stramenopiles.  40 
 41 
Introduction	42 
Ectocarpus has been studied since the nineteenth century and work on this organism has 43 
provided many insights into novel aspects of brown algal biology (Müller, 1967; Charrier et 44 
al., 2008). This long research history, together with several features of the organism that make 45 
it well adapted for genetic and genomic approaches (Coelho et al., 2012a), led to it being 46 
proposed as a general model organism for the brown algae in 2004 (Peters et al., 2004) and to 47 
the initiation of a genome sequencing project that produced a first complete genome assembly 48 
in 2010 (Cock et al., 2010). The publication of the genomic sequence was followed up with 49 
the development of many additional tools and resources including a genetic map (Heesch et 50 
al., 2010), gene mapping techniques, microarrays (Dittami et al., 2009; Coelho et al., 2011), 51 
transcriptomic data (Ahmed et al., 2014; Lipinska et al., 2015), proteomic techniques (Ritter 52 
et al., 2008) and bioinformatics tools (Gschloessl et al., 2008; Prigent et al., 2014). These 53 
genomic resources are currently being exploited to further our understanding of a broad range 54 
of processes, including life cycle regulation (Coelho et al., 2011), sex determination (Lipinska 55 
et al., 2013, 2015; Ahmed et al., 2014), development and morphology (Le Bail et al., 2011), 56 
interactions with pathogens (Zambounis et al., 2012) and metabolism (Meslet-Cladière et al., 57 
2013; Prigent et al., 2014).  58 
The brown algae are an important taxonomic group for several reasons; they are key primary 59 
producers in many coastal ecosystems and have a major influence on marine biodiversity and 60 
ecology (Dayton, 1985; Steneck et al., 2002; Bartsch et al., 2008; Klinger, 2015; Wahl et al., 61 
2015). Brown algae also represent an important resource of considerable commercial value 62 
(Kijjoa & Sawangwong, 2004; Smit, 2004; Hughes et al., 2012) and industrial exploitation of 63 
these organisms has increased markedly in recent years with the expansion of aquaculture 64 
activities, particularly in Asia (Tseng, 2001). Finally, brown algae are also of phylogenetic 65

interest because they are very distantly related to well-studied groups such as the animals, fungi 66 
and land plants and, moreover, have evolved complex multicellularity independently of these 67 
other lineages (Cock et al., 2010; Cock & Collén, 2015). Comparative analyses between brown 68 
algae and members of these other eukaryotic supergroups therefore potentially provide a means 69 
to explore deep evolutionary events of broad, general importance.  70 
A high-quality genome resource is essential if these important features of the brown algae 71 
are to be investigated effectively. The version of the Ectocarpus genome that was published in 72 
2010 (Cock et al., 2010) included detailed manual annotations of many of the genes but gene 73 
structure predictions were based on a limited amount of transcriptomic data (Sanger expressed 74 
sequence tags) and the large-scale assembly of the sequence contigs only associated about 70% 75 
of the genome sequence with linkage groups. Moreover, annotation efforts had focused almost 76 
exclusively on protein-coding genes, largely ignoring the non-coding component of the 77 
genome. The study described here set out to address these shortfalls, exploiting the large 78 
amount of transcriptomic data now available and using recently developed genetic and 79 
bioinformatic approaches to improve both the assembly and annotation of the genome. A high-80 
density, RAD-seq-based genetic map was used to anchor sequence scaffolds onto the 81 
chromosomes, considerably improving the large-scale assembly of the genome. In addition, a 82 
complete reannotation of the genome was carried out based on extensive RNA-seq data. This 83 
updated version of the genome annotation includes information about transcript isoforms and 84 
integrates non-coding loci such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs 85 
(lncRNAs). Finally, we report additional resources including a genome-wide set of single 86 
nucleotide polymorphisms for genetic mapping and improvements to the genome database 87 
such as the addition of a JBrowse-based genome browser that allows multiple types of genome-88 
wide data to be visualised simultaneously.  89

Materials	and	Methods	91 
Biological	material	92 
Ectocarpus strains were cultured as described previously (Coelho et al., 2012b). The male 93 
genome sequenced strain Ec32 (reference CCAP 1310/4 in the Culture Collection of Algae and 94 
Protozoa, Oban, Scotland) is a meiotic offspring of a field sporophyte, Ec17, collected in 1988 95 
in San Juan de Marcona, Peru (Peters et al., 2008). Ec722 is a UV-mutagenised descendant of 96 
Ec32. The female outcrossing line Ec568 is derived from a sporophyte collected in Arica in 97 
northern Chile (Heesch et al., 2010). 98

RNA-seq	100 
The analyses carried out in this study used RNA-seq data generated for biological replicate 101 
(duplicate) samples of partheno-sporophytes and of both young and mature samples for both 102 
male and female gametophytes (ten libraries in all). The production of the young (Lipinska et 103 
al., 2015) and mature (Ahmed et al., 2014) gametophyte RNA-seq data has been described 104 
previously. For each of the replicate partheno-sporophyte samples, total RNA was extracted 105 
and used as a template by Fasteris (CH-1228 Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) to synthesise cDNA 106 
using an oligo-dT primer. The cDNA libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000 107 
technology to generate 100 bp single-end reads. Data quality was assessed using the FASTX 108 
toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html) and the reads were trimmed and 109 
filtered using a quality threshold of 25 (base calling) and a minimal size of 60 bp. Only reads 110 
in which more than 75% of nucleotides had a minimal quality threshold of 20 were retained. 111 
Table S1 shows the number of raw reads generated per sample and the number of reads 112 
remaining after trimming and filtering (cleaned reads). The cleaned reads were mapped to the 113 
Ectocarpus sp. genome (Cock et al., 2010) (available at Orcae; Sterck et al., 2012) using 114 
Tophat2 and the Bowtie2 aligner (Kim et al., 2013). More than 90% of the sequencing reads 115 
for each library mapped to the genome. 116 
De novo assembly of the pooled RNA-seq data from the ten libraries was carried out using 117 
Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011) in normalized mode with default parameters. Weakly expressed 118 
transcripts (isoform percentage <1 and RPKM <1) were removed from the dataset. The 119 
remaining transcripts were aligned against the Ectocarpus reference genome (Ec32) using 120 
GenomeThreader (Gremme et al., 2005) with a maximum intron length of 26,000 bp, a 121 
minimum coverage of 75% and a minimum alignment score of 90%. 122 
 123 
Gene	prediction	124 
Gene prediction was carried out using the EuGene program (Foissac et al., 2008), as described 125 
previously (Cock et al., 2010). Alignments of the Trinity RNA-seq-derived transcripts against 126 
the Ectocarpus sp. reference genome were added to the EuGene pipeline in addition to the data 127 
used for the v1 annotation, which included splice site predictions generated by SpliceMachine 128 
(Degroeve et al., 2005) and Ectocarpus Sanger EST data. The new set of EuGene gene structure 129 
predictions were compared with the gene structures of the v1 annotation using AEGeAn 130 
(Standage & Brendel, 2012) and a combination of automated and manual approaches was used 131

to select the optimal gene structures. Briefly, automatic validation of new predictions was 132 
applied for genes where there were modifications to the UTRs, where additional exons were 133 
added or where there were modifications to the detailed structure of existing exons. In cases 134 
where the new model predicted exon lost, the prediction was retained only if there was 65% 135 
similarity between the reference and the new model. This threshold was reduced to 30% 136 
similarity when the reference gene had only 4 exons or less. A subset of about one hundred 137 
genes for each class was manually reviewed to validate the automatic selection of gene 138 
structures. GenomeView (Abeel et al., 2012) was used to visualise RNA-seq read mapping 139 
information. 140 
 141 
Manual	annotation	142 
The v2 annotation took into account the functional and structural annotation of 325 and 410 143 
genes, respectively, carried out through the Orcae database (Sterck et al., 2012) since the 144 
publication of the v1 annotation. Many of the structural annotations were based on the same 145 
set of RNA-seq data that was used for the genome-wide gene structure prediction but exploited 146 
transcripts that had been generated using a reference-guided approach with Tophat2 and 147 
Cufflinks2 (Trapnell et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2013). Tophat2 was able to map 92% of the 148 
cleaned reads to the genome sequence and 36,565 transcripts were assembled by Cufflinks2 149 
(including multiple transcripts for some loci) using the mapping information and the initial 150 
gene models as guides.  151 
 152 
Annotation	of	gene	functions	153 
Putative functions were assigned to the v2 genes based on the identification of protein domains 154 
using InterProScan, which carried out searches against all its component databases (Jones et 155 
al., 2014). Gene ontology categories were assigned using Blast2GO (Conesa et al., 2005). For 156 
genes where a manually assigned function was already available (3,442 genes), the 157 
InterProScan-based prediction was compared manually with the existing annotation and the 158 
most relevant annotation retained. 159 
 160 
Detection	of	alternative	transcripts	161 
To detect alternative transcripts of the set of 17,418 protein-coding loci, 507,634,855 million 162 
reads of RNA-seq data corresponding to diverse tissues and life cycle stages (Table S1) were 163 
mapped to the Ectocarpus genome using Bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2009) and transcripts were 164

predicted genome-wide using Stringtie (Pertea et al., 2015) with default parameters, guided by 165 
the annotation file from the v2 annotation. A Stringtie prediction was made for each library 166 
based on TopHat2 mapping files. The results were merged using Cuffmerge (Trapnell et al., 167 
2010). Cuffcompare was used to assign the predicted transcripts to the reference genes. 168 
Transcripts with 3’ UTRs > 9300 bp and/or 5’ UTRs > 2500 bp were discarded. Only potential 169 
isoforms (class code = J, O and C) were retained. Prediction of the coding regions of the 170 
alternative transcripts was carried out using Transdecoder (Haas et al., 2013). ORF predictions 171 
were filtered to retain complete coding sequences with both initiation and stop codons. The 172 
longest ORF was retained for each transcript.  173 
A global classification and quantification of the different types of alternative splicing that 174 
generated the transcript isoforms was obtained using SplAdder (Kahles et al., 2016) based on 175 
the mapping of the pooled RNA-seq data. 176 
 177 
Detection	of	non-protein-coding	genes	178 
The detection of microRNA, ribosomal RNA and snoRNA loci has been described previously 179 
(Tarver et al., 2015). 180 
Ectocarpus lncRNA loci were detected using FEELnc 181 
(https://github.com/tderrien/FEELnc) with default parameters and the output transcripts of the 182 
Stringtie analysis described in the previous section. The same specificity threshold (0.97) was 183 
used for both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts to predict lncRNA loci. Transcripts 184 
overlapping annotated protein-coding genes (v2 annotation) were eliminated and a random 185 
forest approach based on ORF coverage (i.e. length of the longest ORF / length of the lncRNA 186 
transcript), transcript size and k-mer frequency was implemented to classify the remaining 187 
transcripts as mRNAs or lncRNAs. Loci with mono-exonic transcripts were eliminated to limit 188 
the inclusion of false positive loci due to read mapping ambiguity. An arbitrary minimum size 189 
of 200 nt was applied to eliminate loci encoding small RNA transcripts. FEELnc also classifies 190 
the predicted lncRNA loci by determining 1) if they overlap (genic) or not (intergenic) with 191 
the nearest gene on the genome, designated the adjacent gene (and which can be a protein-192 
coding gene or small-RNA-encoding locus), 2) if genic lncRNAs overlap with intron or exon 193 
regions of the adjacent gene and in which orientation, sense or antisense, and 3) how intergenic 194 
lncRNAs are orientated with respect to the adjacent gene (within 10 kbp) on the chromosome 195 
(same strand, convergent or divergent).  196

A similar approach was used to detect S. japonica lncRNA loci. For this genome, the 197 
Stringtie transcript prediction used as input for FEELnc was based on mapping of 220,551,196 198 
million RNA-seq reads to the S. japonica genome (Ye et al., 2015). The RNA-seq data 199 
corresponded to female gametes (127,607,414 reads, accession number SRR2064656), spores 200 
(30,552,978 reads, accession number SRR2064654), thalli grown under blue light (11,981,830 201 
reads, accession number SRR371552) or in the dark (12,657,652 reads, accession number 202 
SRR371551), young sporophytes grown under blue (13,333,334 reads, accession number 203 
SRR496757) or white (17,181,148 reads, accession number SRR496799) light and thalli 204 
subjected to heat stress (7,236,840 reads, accession number SRR947066). Orthologous 205 
Ectocarpus and S. japonica lncRNA loci were detected by carrying out reciprocal Blastn 206 
searches (E-value < 10-4). Alignments of lncRNA sequences were carried out with SIM 207 
(http://web.expasy.org/sim/) and visualised with Lalnview (Duret et al., 1996). 208 
DESeq2 with default parameters was used to detect Ectocarpus lncRNA and protein-coding 209 
loci that were differently expressed in sporophyte basal versus upright filaments. 210 
 211 
Genome-wide	identification	of	sequence	variants	212 
Genome sequence data was generated for the female outcrossing line Ec568 using Illumina 213 
HiSeq2500 technology (Fasteris, Switzerland), which produced 25,976,388,600 bp of 2x100 214 
bp paired-end sequence. Sequence variants were detected as described previously (Godfroy et 215 
al., 2015).  216 
To determine whether sequence variants behaved as Mendelian loci, a cross between a UV-217 
mutagenised derivative of the reference genome strain Ec32 (strain Ec722) and the female 218 
outcrossing line Ec568 (Heesch et al., 2010) was used to generate a population of 180 progeny 219 
each corresponding to an independent meiotic event, segregating the two parental alleles of 220 
each variant locus. Two libraries were constructed with pools of 84 and 96 haploid, partheno-221 
sporophyte individuals and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500 technology (Fasteris, 222 
Switzerland) to generate 20,785,058,400 bp and 23,429,143,400 bp of 2x100 bp paired-end 223 
sequence, respectively. Sequence variants were detected in each dataset as described previously 224 
(Godfroy et al., 2015) and VarScan was used to identify SNPs shared by the two pools of 225 
haploid individuals. For each of these SNPs the sum of the variant frequencies observed in the 226 
two pools was calculated, and only those for which this sum was between 0.8 and 1.2 were 227 
retained. VarScan compare was then used to extract the Ec568 variants from the list of 228 
Mendelian segregating SNPs. 229

A Genome Browser was implemented based on Jbrowse (Buels et al., 2016) using a Chado 232 
database (Mungall & Emmert, 2007). The browser integrates both v1 and v2 reference gene 233 
models, raw gene models predicted by EuGene, transcripts predicted by Cufflinks and EST and 234 
RNA-seq read data. 235

Results	241 
Improved	chromosome-scale	assembly	of	the	Ectocarpus	genome	242 
A microsatellite-based genetic map (Heesch et al., 2010) was originally used to produce a 243 
large-scale assembly of the Ectocarpus genome consisting of 34 pseudo-chromosomes (Cock 244 
et al., 2010) corresponding to the 34 linkage groups of the genetic map. The pseudo-245 
chromosomes were constructed by concatenating sequence scaffolds based on the genetic order 246 
of sequence-anchored microsatellite markers on the genetic map (Cock et al., 2010). However, 247 
due to the low density of the markers, the large-scale assembly included only 325 of the 1,561 248 
sequence scaffolds (70.1% of the total sequence length) and, moreover, only 40 (12%) of the 249 
mapped scaffolds could be orientated relative to the chromosome (i.e. only 12% of the scaffolds 250 
contained at least two microsatellite markers which recombined relative to each other). 251 
To improve the large-scale assembly of the Ectocarpus genome, we took advantage of a 252 
high-density, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genetic map that has recently been 253 
generated using a Restriction site associated DNA (RAD)-seq method (K. Avia, personal 254 
communication). The 3,588 SNP markers used to construct the genetic map were mapped to 255 
sequence scaffolds and the recombination information for these markers used to construct a 256 
new set of pseudo-chromosomes (Fig. 1). The new large-scale assembly represents a significant 257 
improvement because it integrates 531 of the 1,561 sequence scaffolds onto genetic linkage 258 
groups (90.5% of the total sequence length) and 49% of these scaffolds have been orientated 259 
with respect to their chromosome. Moreover, the high-density genetic map has allowed several 260 
fragmented linkage groups / pseudo-chromosomes to be fused, reducing the total number from 261 
34 to 28. The exact number of chromosomes in Ectocarpus sp. strain Ec32 is not known but 262

cytogenetic analysis of another Ectocarpus species, E. siliculosus indicated the presence of 263 
approximately 25 chromosomes (Müller, 1966, 1967). 264 
 265 
Reannotation	of	gene	structure	based	on	RNA-seq	data	266 
The initial set of Ectocarpus gene models (referred to hereafter as the v1 annotation) was 267 
generated using EuGene (Foissac et al., 2008) based on a limited amount of transcriptomic 268 
information (91,041 Sanger expressed sequence tags, ESTs; Cock et al., 2010) and therefore 269 
involved a significant amount of de novo prediction. The v1 annotation has been gradually 270 
improved since 2010 by the addition of 325 functional and 410 structural annotations for 271 
individual genes through the Orcae database (Sterck et al., 2012). This gene-by-gene approach 272 
improved the quality of the annotation of a number of selected genes but it was necessary to 273 
extend the approach to improve annotation quality across the whole genome. 274 
A genome-wide reannotation, hereafter referred to as the v2 annotation, was therefore 275 
carried out based on the analysis of 642 million reads of RNA-seq data from ten different 276 
libraries (Ahmed et al., 2014; Lipinska et al., 2015 and this study; Table S1). This data was 277 
assembled into 34,551 de novo transcripts using Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011). 278 
GenomeThreader (Gremme et al., 2005) was able to align 91% of these transcripts to the 279 
genome. Gene prediction for the v2 annotation was then carried out using EuGene and the 280 
34,551 de novo transcripts, along with 83,502 Sanger ESTs and SpliceMachine (Degroeve et 281 
al., 2005) splice site predictions. The 21,958 preliminary gene models generated by this 282 
prediction were then compared with the 16,256 genes of the v1 annotation (Cock et al., 2010) 283 
using AEGeAn (Standage & Brendel, 2012) and a combination of automatic and manual 284 
criteria were used to evaluate the predictions and select the optimal gene model for each locus. 285 
This genome-wide reannotation integrated the results of the manual gene-by-gene annotation 286 
carried out since publication of the v1 annotation by preferentially retaining high quality, expert 287 
functional and structural annotations.  288 
The 21,958 preliminary gene predictions included 1) genes that were identical to the v1 289 
prediction (10,426 genes), 2) genes that were structurally different to their v1 counterpart 290 
(6,295 genes) and 3) novel loci that were not predicted by the v1 annotation (5,237 genes). For 291 
the first set of genes, the v1 gene models were replaced with the RNA-seq-based models, 292 
providing considerable additional information about the UTR structure of the genes (e.g. Fig. 293 
2A). When the RNA-seq-based prediction differed from the v1 model, manual inspection was 294 
used to select the optimal model for each locus (e.g. Fig. 2B; see Methods and Materials for 295

details). This second set of genes also included predictions which indicated that v1 annotation 296 
genes needed to be fused (e.g. Fig. 2C) or split (e.g. Fig. 2D). Novel RNA-seq-based 297 
predictions, not present in the v1 annotation, were filtered to remove probable false positives. 298 
Predictions were retained only if 1) their transcripts had an abundance of >1 RPKM across the 299 
entire (merged) set of RNA-seq data, 2) the start codon of the gene was not located in a repeated 300 
region (to exclude transposon-derived ORFs; Yandell & Ence, 2012) and 3) their coding region 301 
was >100 bp. After applying these filters, 2,030 of the new predictions were retained and 302 
integrated into the v2 annotation.  303 
Overall, the addition of these new genes and updates to the existing genes (fusing or splitting 304 
existing gene models) brought the total number of genes in the v2 annotated genome to 17,418 305 
(Table 1). The transition from the v1 to the v2 version of the genome annotation involved the 306 
modification of 11,108 of the v1 gene models, of which 5,336 were altered within their coding 307 
regions (Table 2). Of the former, 784 involved gene fusions (to produce 404 genes in the v2 308 
annotation), 19 involved splitting v1 annotation gene predictions (to create 38 genes in the v2 309 
annotation) and 123 genes were removed. The v2 annotation now includes coordinates for at 310 
least one of the UTR regions for 78.7% of the 17,418 genes (compared to 52.6% for the v1 311 
annotation; Fig. 3, Table 1). The v2 annotation is publically available through the ORCAE 312 
database (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Ectsi; Sterck et al., 2012).  313 
The Ectocarpus genome database was modified to take into account the large-scale 314 
assembly of the sequence scaffolds. In particular, the sequentially numbered locusIDs were 315 
modified to indicate sequencial position on the pseudochromosome. The correspondence 316 
between the LocusIDs of the v1 and v2 annotations is given in Table S2 and is also available 317 
as a download from the genome database 318 
(https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/gdb/ectocarpusV2/). 319 
 320 
Prediction	of	gene	function	321 
The final 17,418 genes of the v2 annotation were further analysed to improve the prediction of 322 
gene function by comparing protein sequences with the InterPro database using InterProScan 323 
(Jones et al., 2014) and by using Blast2GO (Conesa et al., 2005) to assign gene ontology (GO) 324 
categories. This process allowed functional annotations and GO categories to be assigned to 325 
10,688 and 7,383 of the 17,418 v2 annotation genes, respectively (compared with 5,583 and 326 
5,989, respectively, for the v1 annotation; Table 1). Of the 2,030 genes that were present in the 327

v2 annotation but not the v1 annotation, 212 had matches in the public databases and 135 and 328 
79 were assigned functional annotations and GO categories, respectively. 329 
 330 
Alternative	splicing	331 
A previous search for alternative gene transcripts based on the 91,041 Sanger ESTs detected 332 
isoforms for only a small percentage (2.9%) of the Ectocarpus genes (Cock et al., 2010). Here 333 
we carried out an updated search for alternative transcripts using the available RNA-seq data 334 
(Table S1). The analysis focused on transcript isoforms with alternatively spliced coding 335 
regions because variants of this type are more likely to have biological roles through the 336 
production of variant protein products. A total of 10,723 alternative transcripts of this type 337 
were detected genome-wide, associated with 7,362 (42.3%) of the 17,418 protein-coding 338 
genes. This corresponded to an average of 1.62 transcripts per locus. 339 
Whilst alternative splicing of gene transcripts can potentially lead to the production of two 340 
or more protein products with different biological activities from a single genetic locus, this is 341 
not necessarily the case and alternative transcripts can also represent spliceosomal errors or 342 
correspond to variants that do not differ significantly from the principal transcript in terms of 343 
transcript functionality. To assess the extent to which alternative splicing has the potential to 344 
impact gene function in Ectocarpus, we used Interproscan (Jones et al., 2014) to compare the 345 
domain structures of the predicted protein products of the principal and alternative gene 346 
transcripts of the 7,362 genes that exhibited alternative splicing of their coding region. This 347 
analysis indicated that, on average, each isoform lacked about 21% of the domains that were 348 
detected in the principal transcript. These marked differences between the domain structures 349 
of the protein products of principal and alternative transcripts are likely to significantly modify 350 
the activities of the alternative protein products.  351 
In addition to this genome-wide approach, a more detailed analysis was carried out for four 352 
genes that encoded proteins with multiple, repeated copies of small protein domains. Fig. 4 353 
shows that the alternative transcripts of these genes encode multiple protein variants in which 354 
repeated domains are included or excluded from the protein product in different combinations, 355 
producing proteins with markedly different domain structures. Together with the genome-wide 356 
analysis described above, these analyses suggested that alternative splicing is used in 357 
Ectocarpus to combine protein domain modules to generate multiple protein isoforms from 358 
individual loci. 359

Analysis of the types of alternative splicing events that give rise to transcript isoforms in 360 
Ectocarpus using the program SplAdder (Kahles et al., 2016) indicated that the most common 361 
event was the use of an alternative 3' acceptor site (Table 3). Intron retention events were 362 
relatively rare, representing less than 12% of the detected events.  363 
 364 
Identification	and	integration	of	non-protein-coding	genes	365 
With the exception of tRNA loci (Cock et al., 2010), the v1 annotation provided very little 366 
information about non-protein-coding genes. The v2 annotation includes considerably more 367 
information about this type of locus, in particular integrating 64 microRNA (miRNA) loci, nine 368 
ribosomal RNA loci (rRNA) and 610 of the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) loci recently 369 
predicted by Tarver et al. (2015). The rRNA and snoRNA loci are listed in Tables S3 and S4; 370 
information about the miRNA loci can be found in Tarver et al. (2015). 371 
In vertebrates most snoRNAs are located in introns (Hoeppner & Poole, 2012) but this is 372 
not the case in all species and only about 30% of Ectocarpus snoRNAs are intronic. Work in 373 
other species has shown that the main function of snoRNAs is to direct chemical modification 374 
of other RNA molecules, particularly ribosomal RNAs (reviewed in Bratkovic & Rogelj, 375 
2014). The two major classes of snoRNA, C/D box and H/ACA box, are principally involved 376 
in methylation and pseudouridylation of RNA molecules, respectively, but several alternative 377 
functions have been reported (Kehr et al., 2014). Ectocarpus is predicted to have 95 C/D box 378 
and 515 H/ACA box snoRNAs. Note that the Ectocarpus snoRNAs were detected using 379 
ACAseeker and CDseeker and should therefore be considered predictions until their functions 380 
have been investigated experimentally.  381 
A search of the Ectocarpus genome indicated that the core protein components that associate 382 
with both C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs to form of sno-ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs) are 383 
highly conserved in Ectocarpus (Table S5). 384 
A screen was also carried out for potential long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using the 385 
FEELnc lncRNA prediction pipeline (https://github.com/tderrien/FEELnc) and the RNA-seq 386 
data listed in Table S1. This analysis predicted the presence of 717 lncRNA loci in the 387 
Ectocarpus genome (Table S6), corresponding to a total of 952 different transcripts (1.3 388 
isoforms per locus on average). The mean size of the lncRNA transcripts was 1,708 nucleotides 389 
and varied between 200 (the defined minimal size) and 7,988 nucleotides. The lncRNA loci 390 
were classified based on their configuration relative to the nearest protein-coding gene in the 391 
genome (referred to in the following text as the adjacent gene) and included both loci that were 392

13	
	
located entirely in an intergenic region (i.e. long intergenic non-coding RNAs or lincRNAs) 393 
and loci that overlapped with their adjacent gene (Fig. S1). About 45% of the lncRNAs were 394 
classed as lincRNAs. Expression analysis indicated that lncRNA transcripts were about eight-395 
fold less abundant on average than those of protein-coding genes (Fig. 5). A similar difference 396 
in mean expression level has been observed in animal and land plant systems (Ulitsky & Bartel, 397 
2013; Chekanova, 2015 and references therein). The Ectocarpus lincRNA loci tend to occur in 398 
regions of the genome of low gene density. The mean distance of lincRNA loci from flanking 399 
protein-coding genes is 8,654 bp, which is significantly longer (Wilcoxon test P < 2.2e-6) than 400 
the mean distance between protein-coding loci (4,154 bp). 401 
To determine whether lncRNAs exhibited differential expression patterns in different 402 
tissues, we compared abundances of lncRNA transcripts in replicate samples of two different 403 
tissues of the sporophyte stage, the strongly adhering, prostrate filaments of the basal system 404 
and the upright filaments of the apical system (Peters et al., 2008). DESeq2 identified 219 405 
lncRNA loci that were differentially expressed between these two tissues, and 4,019 406 
differentially expressed protein-coding genes (padj < 0.1 and |log2fold-change| ≥ 1 in both 407 
cases).  408 
To determine the extent to which the sequences of the Ectocarpus lncRNAs have been 409 
conserved over evolutionary time, we carried out a search for lncRNA loci in a second brown 410 
algal genome, that of the kelp Saccharina japonica (Ye et al., 2015). The Ectocarpus sp. and 411 
S. japonica lineages are thought to have diverged between 80 and 110 mya (Silberfeld et al., 412 
2010; Kawai et al., 2015). Predicted lncRNA loci were compared between the two species 413 
rather than simply searching for sequences related to Ectocarpus lncRNAs in the S. japonica 414 
genome as the former approach is more likely to detect bona fide orthologues (Ulitsky & Bartel, 415 
2013). S. japonica transcripts were predicted using Stringtie (Pertea et al., 2015) based on the 416 
mapping of 220,551,196 million reads of RNA-seq data (Ye et al., 2015), corresponding to 417 
several different tissues, to the assembled genome sequence. Based on these data, FEELnc 418 
predicted the presence of 2,840 lncRNA loci in the S. japonica genome (Table S7), 419 
corresponding to a total of 3,568 different transcripts (1.3 isoforms per locus on average). The 420 
mean size of the S. japonica lncRNA transcripts was 2,036 nucleotides and varied between 200 421 
(the defined minimal size) and 26,887 nucleotides. As with the Ectocarpus lncRNAs, the S. 422 
japonica lncRNAs were found to be organised in a range of configurations relative to the 423 
adjacent gene on the genome (Fig. S2). Comparison of the sets of predicted lncRNAs from 424 
Ectocarpus and S. japonica using Blastn identified 64 pairs of loci that exhibited reciprocal 425 
best Blast matches with E-values lower than 10-4 (Table S8). These loci are highly likely to be 426

orthologous. Note that Blast comparisons may underestimate the extent of similarity between 427 
Ectocarpus and S. japonica lncRNAs because the program relies on the presence of short 428 
regions of high sequence conservation to seed alignments. 429 
Comparison of pairs of orthologous lncRNAs from Ectocarpus and S. japonica (e.g. Fig. 6) 430 
indicated that they tended to contain both conserved and species-specific domains, with the 431 
latter usually being located at the ends of the RNA molecules. This suggests that there may not 432 
be strong selection pressure on the length of the lncRNA molecules nor on the precise sites of 433 
initiation and termination of the mature transcripts. 434 
 435 
Impact	of	 the	updated	 large-scale	assembly	and	gene	annotation	on	 large-scale	genome	436 
features	including	the	sex	chromosome	and	an	integrated	viral	genome	437 
Linkage group 30 of the v1 assembly was recently shown to correspond to the sex chromosome 438 
in Ectocarpus (Ahmed et al., 2014). This linkage group consisted of 20 scaffolds in the v1 439 
assembly but has been considerably extended in the v2 assembly (chromosome 13 in Fig. 1) 440 
with the addition of a further 16 scaffolds, increasing the estimated physical length of the 441 
chromosome (cumulative scaffold length) from 4,994 to 6,933 kbp. The non-recombining sex-442 
determining region was not affected by this update, as all the additional scaffolds are located 443 
in the pseudoautosomal regions of the chromosome. However, as we have recently described 444 
a number of unusual features of the pseudoautosomal regions (Luthringer et al., 2015), we 445 
verified that these observations were still valid for the updated version of the chromosome. 446 
This analysis confirmed that the updated pseudoautosomal regions continue to exhibit a 447 
number of structural features that are intermediate between those of the autosomes and the sex-448 
determining region. In particular, compared with the autosomes, the updated pseudoautosomal 449 
regions still exhibit significantly reduced gene density, increased content of transposable 450 
element sequences, lower %GC content and the genes had significantly smaller and fewer 451 
exons (supplementary Fig. S3). The conclusions of the Luthringer et al. (2015) study therefore 452 
remain valid for the updated version of the sex chromosome. 453 
The genome of Ectocarpus strain Ec32 contains an integrated copy of a large DNA virus, 454 
closely related to the Ectocarpus phaeovirus EsV-1 (Cock et al., 2010). Microarray analysis 455 
had shown that all the viral genes were silent (Cock et al., 2010) and the RNA-seq data analysed 456 
here confirmed this observation, indicating complete silencing of this region of the 457 
chromosome under all the conditions analysed (Fig. S4). 458

A	genome-wide	variant	resource	for	genetic	analysis	of	brown	algal	gene	function	460 
To create an additional genetic resource for gene mapping in Ectocarpus, a genome re-461 
sequencing approach was used to identify sequence variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, 462 
SNPs, and indels) across the entire genome. Hi-seq2500 Illumina technology was used to 463 
generate 25,976,388,600 bp of paired-end, sequence reads (121x genome coverage) for the 464 
female outcrossing line Ec568 (Heesch et al., 2010). A total of 340,665 high quality sequence 465 
variants (Table S9) were identified by comparing this data with the reference genome of the 466 
male strain Ec32 (Cock et al., 2010) plus the sex-determining region from the Ec32-related 467 
female strain Ec597 (Ahmed et al., 2014).  468 
To further validate the sequence variants as potential genetic markers, we used a bulked 469 
segregant approach to determine whether they behaved as Mendelian loci. Genomic DNA 470 
extracts from a population of 180 segregating progeny derived from a cross between a UV-471 
mutagenised derivative of the reference genome strain Ec32 (strain Ec722) and the female 472 
outcrossing line Ec568 were grouped into two bulked segregant pools (84 and 96 individuals) 473 
and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Lists of SNP variants were then generated for the two 474 
bulked segregant pools and the two lists compared to identify 390,804 shared SNPs that 475 
exhibited a 1:1 segregation pattern in the p ogeny population and were therefore behaving as 476 
Mendelian loci. Using this data, 237,839 of the 340,665 sequence variants obtained by mapping 477 
the Ec568 DNA-seq data against the reference scaffolds (see above) were validated as 478 
Mendelian genetic markers (Table S9). The average distance between adjacent pairs of the 479 
genetic markers identified is 823 bp, providing a high-density resource for genetic analysis in 480 
this species. 481 
 482 
Extension	and	improvement	of	the	Ectocarpus	genome	database	483 
The v1 annotation of the Ectocarpus genome has been publically available on the Orcae 484 
database (Sterck et al., 2012) since its publication in 2010. We have updated the database by 485 
adding the v2 annotation described in this study. In addition, a v2 annotation-based Jbrowse 486 
genome browser has been created (http://mmodev.sb-roscoff.fr/jbrowse/) to allow 487 
simultaneous visualisation of multiple types of data in a genome context. The Jbrowse genome 488 
browser allows parallel visualisation of gene models for both coding and non-coding loci, 489 
transcript predictions based on RNA-seq data, genetic markers including microsatellites and 490 
SNP markers, raw RNA-seq data for both messenger RNAs and small RNAs, Sanger EST data, 491 
micro-array data and tiling array data. The Jbrowse genome browser is complementary to the 492

Orcae database, providing an environment for the compilation and analysis of newly generated 493 
data before information is definitively incorporated into Orcae, which is the reference database. 494 
It is possible for registered users of the Jbrowse genome browser to create private versions in 495 
order to upload unpublished and working datasets.  496 
 497 
Discussion	498 
The objective of the work reported here was to improve the utility of the Ectocarpus genome 499 
sequence as a genomic resource.  500 
A high-density, RAD-seq-based genetic map was exploited to significantly improve the 501 
large-scale assembly of the genome. This approach allowed 90.5% of the genome sequence to 502 
be assembled into 28 pseudo-chromosomes, providing a high quality reference genome for 503 
future comparisons with other brown algal genomes focused on synteny and large-scale 504 
organisation of chromosomal regions.  505 
In addition, extensive RNA-seq data was used to improve 11,108 existing gene models and 506 
to identify 2,030 new protein-coding genes. New data available in the public databases has 507 
allowed the functional annotation associated with the protein-coding genes to be considerably 508 
improved. Sixty-one percent of genes have now been assigned functional information, 509 
compared with 34% in the v1 annotation.  510 
The RNA-seq data was also exploited to evaluate the extent to which protein-coding genes 511 
generate alternative transcripts. Wu et al. (2013) reported strong skews in codon usage at both 512 
the 5' and 3' ends of Ectocarpus exons. Based on a preliminary analysis that indicated a low 513 
level of alternative splicing compared with humans, these authors suggested that the skews 514 
might reflect strong selection to preserve exon splicing enhancers to avoid mis-splicing of gene 515 
transcripts. Our analysis, which was based on a significantly larger transcriptomic dataset, 516 
detected a frequency of alternative splicing of about 1.62 transcripts per gene on average. It is 517 
difficult to precisely evaluate whether Ectocarpus exhibits a particularly low level of 518 
alternative splicing compared to other model organisms based on this value because estimates 519 
for these other organisms are constantly being revised as more extensive transcriptomic 520 
datasets become available. Based on current estimates, however, the frequency of alternative 521 
splicing in Ectocarpus falls within the range of 1.2 to 3.4 transcripts per intron-containing gene 522 
proposed for diverse model organisms with intron-rich genomes including humans, mouse, 523 
Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana (Kianianmomeni 524

et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Lee & Rio, 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), and therefore does not 525 
appear to be exceptionally low.  526 
As far as the types of alternative splicing events are concerned, the Ectocarpus genome does 527 
not show the same bias towards intron retention events that has been observed with members 528 
of the green lineage such as Arabidopsis or Volvox (Reddy et al., 2013; Kianianmomeni et al., 529 
2014). Instead, use of alternative 3' acceptor sites is very common (41% of events), a bias that 530 
has not been observed in other genomes as far as we are aware. Analysis of the domain 531 
composition of predicted protein products of alternative transcripts indicated that alternative 532 
splicing is likely to contribute significantly to the complexity of the Ectocarpus proteome.  533 
The initial v1 annotation focused on protein-coding genes. In this study a genome-wide 534 
search was also carried out for non-coding genes, particularly lncRNA loci. Comparison of the 535 
Ectocarpus lncRNAs with the lncRNA complement of the kelp S. japonica indicated that some 536 
of the lncRNA loci were already present in the last common ancestor of these two species and 537 
have been at least partially conserved, at the sequence level, over the period of about 80 and 538 
110 mya (Silberfeld et al., 2010; Kawai et al., 2015) since the divergence of the two species. 539 
Conserved regions were often associated within the same lncRNA with regions that had no 540 
equivalent in the opposite species suggesting that brown algal lncRNAs may be organised in a 541 
modular fashion and be relatively insensitive to the presence or absence of additional lengths 542 
of sequence associated with functional modules. The catalogues of Ectocarpus and S. japonica 543 
lncRNA loci are expected to serve as important reference sets for future analyses of lncRNA 544 
function in the brown algae.  545 
A genome-wide SNP resource was also developed as part of this study. This collection of 546 
SNPs will be a valuable tool for future genetic analyses using Ectocarpus as a model system 547 
(Cock et al., 2011; Coelho et al., 2012a). All of these new and updated resources have been 548 
integrated into the Ectocarpus genome database, which has also been improved and extended 549 
to facilitate exploitation of the genome data and associated information.  550 
With the integration of the new information and resources described here, the Ectocarpus 551 
genome represents one of the most extensively annotated genomes within the stramenopile 552 
group and, as such, will serve as an important reference genome for future genome analysis 553 
projects. Recently, the Ectocarpus genome provided a reference for the analysis of the larger 554 
and more complex genome of the kelp Saccharina japonica (Ye et al., 2015) and similar 555 
comparisons are expected in the future as part of the many ongoing brown algal and 556 
stramenopile genome projects.  557

Fig. 1 Large-scale assembly of the Ectocarpus scaffolds into pseudochromosomes based on a 783 
high-density, RAD-seq-based genetic map. Each bar represents one of the 28 chromosomes. 784 
Sequence scaffolds (supercontigs) are drawn to scale and identified with numbers (e.g. 207, 785 
sctg_207). Left or right pointing arrowheads indicate that the scaffolds have been orientated 786 
with respect to the chromosome (i.e. scaffolds with at least two markers separated by at least 787 
one recombination event); unorientated scaffolds are indicated with a spot. Chromosome 13 788 
corresponds to the sex chromosome and the non-recombining sex-determining region is 789 
indicated with a bar. 790 
 791 
Fig. 2 Representative comparisons of v1 and v2 annotation gene predictions illustrating the 792 
major types of annotation correction carried out during the transition between the two versions. 793 
Protein coding exons are in light or dark green for genome annotation versions v1 and v2, 794 
respectively, UTRs are in grey and introns are indicated by thin black lines. a analysis of the 795 
RNA-seq data allowed the identification of UTRs for gene Ec-27_006370. b v2 genes Ec-796 
27_006520 and Ec-05_002440 have been extended and modified compared to their v1 797 
equivalents. c v1 genes Esi0002_0099 and Esi0002_0101 were fused to create a single locus, 798 
Ec-01_007860. d v1 gene Esi0002_0311 was split to create two loci, Ec-01_006420 and Ec-799 
01_006425. Arrows indicate gene features that were not identified or misidentified by the v1 800 
annotation. 801 
 802 
Fig. 3 Comparison of the degree of completeness of gene annotations in the v1 and v2 803 
versions of the Ectocarpus genome annotation. 804

Fig. 4 Protein variants predicted to be encoded by alternative transcripts of four genes. a 806 
alternative products of the ROCO LRR GTPase gene Ec-06_001640 with different LRR repeat 807 
structures, b alternative products of the nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by the NB-ARC 808 
TPR domain containing gene Ec-25_000110 with different TPR domain contents, c alternative 809 
products of the Notch domain gene Ec-19_004380 with different Notch repeat structures, d 810 
alternative products of the Ankyrin repeat gene Ec-09_000460 with different Ankyrin repeat 811 
structures. Grey lines indicate domains shared between proteins. Roc, Ras of complex proteins 812

Fig. 5 Ectocarpus lncRNA transcript abundance. On average, lncRNA transcripts are about 816 
eight-fold less abundant than those of protein coding genes. 817 
 818 
Fig. 6 Examples of lncRNA loci conserved between Ectocarpus and Saccharina japonica. 819 
lncRNA loci (in blue) are shown for each species, along with the nearest protein-coding locus 820 
on the chromosome (in red). Genes above the line, which represents the chromosome, are 821 
transcribed to the right, genes below the line to the left. Percent identities over the aligned 822 
regions of Ectocarpus and S. japonica lncRNA transcripts are indicated. Ec, Ectocarpus, Sj, S. 823
