ABSTRACT 
 
Is it possible to create living organisms from inorganic material? : Whether it is possible to create living 
organisms? Living organisms are reduced dimensions of elementary form of consciousness. First of all let us point 
out that the elementary field of consciousness is only thing which is. So all divisions, we humans make in this 
universe are the product of our limited cognition. In essence the reality is one undivided whole, but we have to make 
progress and therefore we have to play with in our limitations and analyse reality part by part. So the question we 
asked in the beginning. Is it possible to create living organisms? In fact organisms from artificially synthesized 
DNA have been created. So our guess is it may not be impossible to create living organisms, but for creating 
sophisticated multicellular organisms we may need more than artificially synthesised DNA. According to us we 
have to learn to manipulate elementary field of consciousness. But there may be a limit imposed by laws of 
consciousness.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
A Theory of Everything  
 
The biological organisms can also be viewed as quantum 
computational algorithms (and quantum computation 
may generate consciousness). In biological organisms 
everything is either random or determined. The 
randomness can be explained by quantum physics and 
deterministic events can be explained by classical 
physics. Thus-Universal consciousness (read quantum 
computation) is everything. It may be possible to create 
conscious machines, since if we are able to create 
quantum computers of sufficient complexity; it will 
make them conscious (as per our definition of the 
consciousness). Homo sapiens in future may be 
controlled by these quantum computers who will be 
much more advanced than them. 
 
Quantum Mechanics and History of mankind 
 
It is pertinent to ask the question why the events that 
took place in the history of mankind took place in the 
first place. Weren’t there any other possibilities? Why a 
particular path was chosen? If we go by linear logic the 
various possibilities seem equally probable. Why then a 
particular turn of events? The answer according to us 
lies in quantum mechanics. Broadly quantum mechanics 
is probabilistic. The outcome according to quantum 
mechanics is not determinate. Sometimes the outcomes 
are equally probable or at least possible. So at many 
times in human history there were outcomes which were 
equally probable and it was a matter of chance which 
outcome was chosen. 
 
Entanglement and Consciousness 
 
We have proposed in our earlier papers that matter has 
emerged from consciousness by reduction of the number 
of dimensions. More clearly we have proposed that 
consciousness is an infinite dimensional quantum 
computer and the space time has emerged by reduction 
of some dimensions of the consciousness. Now advances 
in physics have shown something of an analogous nature. 
It has been shown that space-time may emerge from 
quantum entanglement. It is noteworthy that we have 
proposed that consciousness is an infinite dimensional 
quantum computer. Thus entanglement is an 
indispensable part of the consciousness. And from this 
emerges space-time.

Evolution and Quantum Mechanics 
 
The genetic variation generated by mutations can be 
explained by quantum theory. According to this 
hypothesis the genes can be considered as qubits 
(Quantum analogue of bits). Since the qubits themselves 
are governed by laws of quantum mechanics, the 
quantum mechanics can be invoked at the level of 
mechanism generating mutations. Mutations can occur if 
a mistake is made as DNA copies itself during cell 
division. Why a particular gene is mutated, will be 
governed by laws of quantum mechanics.
