ABSTRACT	1	
Vibrio	natriegens	has	recently	emerged	as	an	alternative	to	Escherichia	coli	for	molecular	2	
biology	and	biotechnology,	but	low-efficiency	genetic	tools	hamper	its	development.		Here,	3	
we	uncover	how	to	induce	natural	competence	in	V.	natriegens	and	describe	methods	for	4	
multiplex	genome	editing	by	natural	transformation	(MuGENT).	MuGENT	promotes	5	
integration	of	multiple	genome	edits	at	high-efficiency	on	unprecedented	timescales.	Also,	6	
this	method	allows	for	generating	highly	complex	mutant	populations,	which	can	be	7	
exploited	for	metabolic	engineering	efforts.	As	a	proof-of-concept,	we	attempted	to	8	
enhance	production	of	the	value	added	chemical	poly-β-hydroxybutyrate	(PHB)	in	V.	9	
natriegens	by	targeting	the	expression	of	nine	genes	involved	in	PHB	biosynthesis	via	10	
MuGENT.	Within	1	week,	we	isolated	edited	strains	that	produced	~100	times	more	PHB	11	
than	the	parent	isolate	and	~3.3	times	more	than	a	rationally	designed	strain.	Thus,	the	12	
methods	described	here	should	extend	the	utility	of	this	species	for	diverse	academic	and	13	
industrial	applications.			 	14

V.	natriegens	is	the	fastest	growing	organism	known,	with	a	doubling	time	of	<10	min1,	2.	1	
With	broad	metabolic	capabilities,	lack	of	pathogenicity,	and	its	rapid	growth	rate,	it	is	an	2	
attractive	alternative	to	E.	coli	for	diverse	molecular	biology	and	biotechnology	3	
applications3,	4.	Methods	for	classical	genetic	techniques	have	been	developed	for	V.	4	
natriegens,	but	these	are	relatively	laborious,	require	multiple	steps,	and	must	be	used	5	
sequentially	to	generate	multiple	genome	edits3,	4.	The	challenges	of	these	techniques	6	
contrast	with	the	ease	of	genetics	in	Vibrio	species	that	are	naturally	transformable.	7	
Competent	Vibrio	species	can	take	up	DNA	from	the	environment	and	integrate	it	into	their	8	
genome	by	homologous	recombination;	processes	known	as	natural	competence	and	9	
natural	transformation,	respectively5-8.	The	inducing	cue	for	natural	transformation	in	10	
competent	Vibrio	species	is	growth	on	the	chitinous	shells	of	crustacean	zooplankton,	11	
which	are	commonly	found	in	the	aquatic	environment	where	these	microbes	reside5.	12	
Chitin	induces	the	expression	of	the	competence	regulator	TfoX9,	10.	In	fact,	overexpression	13	
of	TfoX	obviates	the	need	for	chitin	induction,	allowing	competent	Vibrio	species	to	be	14	
naturally	transformed	in	rich	media5,	9.		15	
	16	
As	no	reports	of	natural	transformation	existed	for	V.	natriegens,	we	first	sought	to	17	
establish	whether	this	was	possible.	Unlike	naturally	competent	V.	cholerae,	incubation	on	18	
chitin	did	not	lead	to	detectable	transformation	in	V.	natriegens	(data	not	shown).	However,	19	
ectopic	expression	of	TfoX	(either	the	endogenous	tfoX	gene	or	one	from	Vibrio	cholerae)	20	
on	an	IPTG-inducible	plasmid	(pMMB)	supported	high	rates	of	natural	transformation	(Fig.	21	
1a).	This	was	tested	using	a	linear	PCR	product	that	replaces	the	gene	encoding	the	DNA	22	
endonuclease	Dns	with	an	antibiotic	resistance	(AbR)	marker.	The	dns	locus	was	used	as	a	23	
target	for	transformation	assays	throughout	this	manuscript	because	loss	of	this	gene	does	24	
not	impact	growth	or	viability	in	rich	medium.	Under	optimal	conditions	~1-10%	of	the	25	
population	had	integrated	the	transforming	DNA	(tDNA),	which	matches	the	highest	rates	26	
of	transformation	observed	among	competent	species11	(Fig.	1a-c).	Natural	transformation	27	
of	V.	natriegens	required	very	little	transforming	DNA	(tDNA)	(highly	efficient	with	even	1	28	
ng	/	108	CFU)	and	was	dependent	on	the	length	of	homologous	sequence	surrounding	the	29	
mutation	(Fig.	1b	and	c).	This	method	could	also	be	used	to	introduce	point	mutations	into	30

V.	natriegens	(tested	with	tDNA	containing	an	rpsL	K43R	SmR	allele);	however,	this	activity	1	
was	partially	suppressed	by	the	mismatch	repair	system	(Fig.	1d).					2	
	3	
Having	demonstrated	V.	natriegens	is	naturally	competent,	we	sought	to	determine	if	we	4	
could	use	natural	transformation	to	perform	scarless	multiplex	genome	editing	by	natural	5	
transformation	(MuGENT)12.	MuGENT	operates	under	the	premise	that	under	competence	6	
inducing	conditions,	only	a	subpopulation	of	cells	is	transformable.	Those	cells	that	can	be	7	
transformed,	however,	have	the	capacity	to	take	up	and	integrate	multiple	tDNAs12,	13.	Thus,	8	
during	MuGENT,	cells	are	incubated	with	two	types	of	linear	tDNA;	(1)	a	selected	product	9	
that	introduces	an	antibiotic	resistance	marker	into	the	genome	and	(2)	unselected	10	
products	that	introduce	scarless	genome	edits	of	interest	at	one	or	more	loci.	11	
	12	
We	first	tested	the	ability	of	MuGENT	to	introduce	a	single	unmarked	genome	edit	(also	13	
known	as	cotransformation).	To	facilitate	measurement	of	cotransformation,	we	noted	this	14	
species	forms	opaque	colonies	on	agar	plates	(Fig.	2a),	which	could	be	due	to	the	15	
production	of	a	capsular	polysaccharide.	Consistent	with	this,	inactivating	a	homolog	of	the	16	
essential	capsule	biosynthesis	gene	wbfF14	resulted	in	the	formation	of	transparent	17	
colonies	on	agar	plates	and	loss	of	expression	of	a	high	molecular	weight	polysaccharide	18	
(Fig.	2a	and	2b).	Thus,	to	test	cotransformation	we	used	an	unselected	product	to	replace	19	
~500	bp	of	the	5ʹ	end	of	the	wbfF	gene	with	a	premature	stop	codon	and	scored	20	
cotransformation	via	colony	morphology	(opaque	vs.	transparent)	on	agar	plates	(Fig.	3a).	21	
We	found	that	cotransformation	was	remarkably	efficient	in	V.	natriegens	(up	to	~80%),	22	
even	with	low	amounts	(~25-50	ng	/	108	CFU)	of	the	unselected	product	(Fig.	3b).	Also,	23	
cotransformation	with	1	kb	flanks	on	the	unselected	product	was	possible,	but	at	~6-fold	24	
lower	frequencies	than	with	3	kb	flanks	(Fig.	3c).		25	
	26	
We	next	tested	the	full	multiplex	genome	editing	capacity	of	MuGENT	to	simultaneously	27	
cotransform	multiple	scarless	genome	edits	into	the	genome	in	a	single	step12,	15.	Since	28	
there	is	no	selection	for	integration	of	the	unselected	genome	edits	in	cis	during	MuGENT,	29	
output	populations	are	highly	heterogeneous	and	individual	mutants	contain	any	number	30

multiple	iterative	cycles	to	further	increase	the	complexity	of	genome	edits	in	the	1	
population	(Fig.	3d)12.		2	
	3	
As	an	initial	test	of	multiplex	genome	editing,	we	targeted	5	genes	whose	mutagenesis	was	4	
considered	unlikely	to	affect	viability	or	growth	in	LB.	These	targets	included	four	5	
carbohydrate	transporters	(specific	for	mannitol,	fructose,	sucrose,	and	trehalose	–	all	of	6	
which	are	absent	in	LB)	and	the	dns	gene.	All	genes	were	targeted	for	inactivation	by	7	
replacing	~500	bp	of	the	5’	end	of	each	gene	with	a	premature	stop	codon.	Integration	of	8	
genome	edits	was	determined	by	multiplex	allele-specific	colony	PCR	(MASC-PCR)16	(Fig.	9	
3e).	Following	one	cycle	of	MuGENT,	we	found	that	~70%	of	the	population	contained	at	10	
least	1	genome	edit,	with	~25%	of	the	population	containing	3-4	genome	edits	(Fig.	3f).	A	11	
quadruple	mutant	from	this	experiment	was	isolated	and	whole	genome	sequencing	of	this	12	
strain	did	not	reveal	any	off-target	mutations.	Thus,	MuGENT	rapidly	generated	V.	13	
natriegens	strains	with	multiple	large	(0.5	kb)	scarless	genome	edits	at	high-efficiency	14	
without	off-target	effects,	and	can	be	used	to	make	highly	complex	mutant	populations.		15	
	16	
As	a	second	demonstration	of	multiplex	genome	editing,	we	demonstrated	its	utility	in	17	
metabolic	engineering	by	attempting	to	rapidly	enhance	production	of	a	value-added	18	
chemical	in	V.	natriegens.	This	species	naturally	accumulates	low	levels	of	the	bioplastic	19	
precursor	poly-β-hydroxybutyrate	(PHB)	as	a	storage	polymer17.	PHB	is	derived	from	the	20	
condensation	and	subsequent	NADPH-dependent	reduction	of	acetyl-CoA	precursors18.	21	
Thus,	for	our	targets,	we	tuned	the	expression	(swap	out	Pnative	for	IPTG-inducible	Ptac)	or	22	
inactivated	genes	that	we	hypothesized	would	affect	NADPH	and/or	acetyl-CoA	availability.	23	
The	targets	for	promoter	swaps	were	the	PHB	synthesis	operon	(phaBAC),	NAD	kinase	24	
(nadK),	and	two	transhydrogenases	(pntAB	and	udhA),	while	targets	for	inactivation	were	25	
phosphoglucose	isomerase	(pgi),	citrate	synthase	(gltA),	phosphotransacetylase	(pta),	26	
isocitrate	lyase	(aceA),	and	lactate	dehydrogenase	(ldhA)	(Fig.	4a).	Thus,	there	were	512	27	
possible	combinations	for	these	9	genome	edits.	We	performed	multiple	cycles	of	MuGENT	28	
to	introduce	these	genome	edits	into	a	competent	population	of	V.	natriegens.	At	each	cycle,	29	
the	selected	product	was	designed	to	swap	the	AbR	marker	at	the	dns	locus	to	maintain	30

perform,	~50%	of	the	population	had	3	or	more	genome	edits	and	~10%	contained	5+	1	
genome	edits	(Fig.	4b).	To	select	mutants	with	increased	PHB	production,	we	then	plated	2	
this	output	population	onto	media	containing	Nile	red,	which	stains	PHB	granules19.	Nile	3	
red	fluorescence	on	these	plates	was	highly	heterogeneous,	suggesting	that	some	4	
genotypes	produced	more	PHB	than	the	parent	isolate	(Fig.	4c).	A	number	of	highly	5	
fluorescent	colonies	were	picked	and	the	genotypes	determined	by	MASC-PCR.	Also,	PHB	in	6	
these	select	strains	was	directly	measured	by	HPLC.	Cumulatively,	these	analyses	rapidly	7	
revealed	genotypes	that	produced	~100-fold	more	PHB	than	the	parent	and	~3.3-fold	8	
more	than	a	strain	with	just	the	Ptac-phaBAC	mutation	(Fig.	4d).	Overexpression	of	the	9	
phaBAC	locus	is	a	commonly	used	rational	approach	for	enhancing	PHB	production	18,	20.	10	
Thus,	this	result	demonstrates	that	MuGENT	can	allow	for	rapid	isolation	of	genotypes	11	
associated	with	enhanced	phenotypes	(e.g.	enhanced	PHB	production)	compared	to	12	
rationally	engineered	strains	(e.g.	a	Ptac-phaBAC	mutant)	without	prior	knowledge	of	13	
effective	combinations	of	individual	mutations.	14	
	15	
While	many	methods	for	multiplex	genome	editing	in	bacterial	systems	have	been	16	
described21,	many	of	these	are	limited	to	small	changes	such	as	SNPs.	MuGENT,	on	the	17	
other	hand,	can	efficiently	swap,	insert,	or	remove	whole	promoters	or	coding	sequences	as	18	
demonstrated	above.	Furthermore,	one	of	the	major	limitations	to	other	multiplex	genome	19	
editing	methods	is	that	mutagenesis	must	be	performed	in	strains	lacking	DNA	repair	20	
pathways	to	allow	for	high-efficiency	integration	of	genome	edits,	which	results	in	a	large	21	
number	of	off-target	mutations16,	21.	MuGENT	in	V.	natriegens	is	performed	in	DNA	repair	22	
sufficient	backgrounds,	thus,	little	to	no	off	target	mutations	are	introduced	during	the	23	
procedure	as	indicated	above.	Also,	unlike	other	multiplex	editing	approaches,	MuGENT	24	
requires	no	specialized	equipment	and,	thus,	has	the	potential	to	make	multiplex	genome	25	
editing	commonplace.	26	
	27	
In	conclusion,	this	study	demonstrates	that	MuGENT	is	a	rapid,	efficient,	and	simple	tool	for	28	
engineering	the	V.	natriegens	genome.	This	microbe	is	already	being	developed	as	an	29	
alternative	to	E.	coli,	and	we	believe	that	the	ease	and	speed	of	MuGENT	will	extend	the	use	30

applications.		2	
METHODS	3	
Bacterial	strains	and	culture	conditions	4	
The	parent	V.	natriegens	strain	used	throughout	this	study	was	a	spontaneous	rifampicin-5	
resistant	derivative	of	ATCC	140482.	For	a	list	of	all	strains	used	/	generated	in	this	study,	6	
see	Table	S1.	Strains	were	routinely	grown	in	LB+v2	salts	(LBv2)3,	which	is	LB	Miller	broth	7	
(BD)	supplemented	with	200	mM	NaCl,	23.14	mM	MgCl2,	and	4.2	mM	KCl.	LBv2	was	8	
supplemented	with	100	μM	IPTG,	50	μg/mL	kanamycin	(Kan),	200	μg/mL	spectinomycin	9	
(Spec),	100	μg/mL	rifampicin	(Rif),	100	μg/mL	streptomycin	(Sm),	or	100	μg/mL	10	
carbenicillin	(Carb)	as	appropriate.		11	
	12	
Generation	of	mutant	strains	and	constructs	13	
Mutant	constructs	were	generated	by	splicing-by-overlap	extension	(SOE)	PCR	exactly	as	14	
previously	described22.	Briefly,	for	three-piece	mutant	constructs	(i.e.	for	constructs	where	15	
a	gene	of	interest	is	replaced	with	an	AbR	cassette	or	where	the	native	promoter	is	swapped	16	
for	a	Ptac	promoter)	segments	were	designated	UP,	MIDDLE,	and	DOWN	and	correspond	to:	17	
(1)	UP	=	the	upstream	region	of	homology	amplified	with	F1	and	R1	primers,	(2)	DOWN	=	18	
the	downstream	region	of	homology	amplified	with	F2	and	R2	primers,	and	(3)	MIDDLE	=	19	
the	AbR	marker	or	promoter	swap	fragment.	For	two-piece	mutant	constructs	(i.e.	for	20	
constructs	where	~501	bp	of	the	5’	end	of	a	gene	is	replaced	with	a	stop	codon),	the	21	
mutation	of	interest	is	incorporated	into	the	R1	and	F2	primers	used	to	amplify	the	22	
upstream	and	downstream	regions	of	homology,	respectively.	Gel	purified	segments	were	23	
then	mixed	in	equal	ratios	and	used	as	template	for	a	SOE	PCR	reaction	with	the	F1	and	R2	24	
primers.	All	mutant	constructs	were	made	using	Phusion	polymerase.	These	were	25	
introduced	into	the	V.	natriegens	genome	via	natural	transformation	as	described	below.	26	
All	primers	used	to	generate	mutant	constructs	are	listed	in	Table	S2.		27

Natural	transformation	/	MuGENT	assays	29	
Strains	harboring	pMMB-tfoX	(Vn	tfoX	or	Vc	tfoX)	were	induced	to	competence	by	growing	30

30°C.	Then,	~108	CFUs	of	this	overnight	culture	(~3.5	μL)	were	diluted	directly	into	350	μL	1	
of	instant	ocean	medium	(28	g/L;	Aquarium	Systems	Inc.)	supplemented	with	100	μM	2	
IPTG.	Transforming	DNA	(tDNA)	was	then	added	as	indicated,	and	reactions	were	3	
incubated	statically	at	30°C	for	5	hours.	Next,	1	mL	of	LBv2	was	added	and	reactions	were	4	
outgrown	at	30°C	with	shaking	(250	rpm)	for	~1-2	hrs.	Then,	reactions	were	plated	for	5	
quantitative	culture	onto	media	to	select	for	integration	of	tDNA	(i.e.	LB+drug	=	6	
transformants)	and	onto	nonselective	media	(i.e.	plain	LB	=	total	viable	counts).	7	
Transformation	efficiency	is	shown	as:	transformants	/	total	viable	counts.		8	
	9	
For	MuGENT,	transformation	assays	were	conducted	exactly	as	described	above.	Unless	10	
otherwise	specified,	~50	ng	of	the	selected	product	was	incubated	with	cells	along	with	11	
~200	ng	of	each	unselected	product.	After	outgrowth,	1/10th	of	the	reaction	was	removed	12	
and	plated	for	MASC-PCR	analysis	(described	below).	If	multiple	cycles	of	MuGENT	were	13	
performed,	the	rest	of	the	reaction	was	grown	overnight	in	LBv2	supplemented	with	100	14	
μM	IPTG,	100μg/mL	carbenicillin	(to	maintain	pMMB-tfoX),	and	the	antibiotic	to	select	for	15	
integration	of	the	selected	product.	The	following	day,	the	population	was	then	subjected	to	16	
another	round	of	MuGENT	as	described	above	using	a	selected	product	containing	a	17	
different	AbR	marker	to	maintain	coselection	at	each	cycle.		18	
	19	
Integration	of	genome	edits	was	detected	via	MASC-PCR	exactly	as	previously	described12,	20	
16.	Briefly,	colonies	were	boiled	in	50	μL	of	sterile	water,	vortexed,	and	then	2	μL	were	used	21	
as	template	in	a	25	μL	PCR	reaction.	PCR	was	conducted	with	Taq	polymerase	(SydLabs)	22	
using	a	modified	5X	Taq	buffer:	200	mM	Tris	pH	8.8,	100	mM	KCl,	100	mM	(NH4)2SO4,	30	23	
mM	MgSO4,	and	1%	Triton	X-100.	The	total	primer	used	in	each	MASC-PCR	reaction	24	
(regardless	of	the	number	of	multiplexed	products	being	detected)	was	1200	nM	(i.e.	for	25	
detection	of	4	multiplexed	genome	edits,	300	nM	of	each	genome	edit-specific	primer	pair	26	
was	used).	The	cycling	conditions	used	were:	95°C	3	min;	26	×	[95°C	40s,	58°C	30s,	72°C	3	27	
min];	72°C	3	min;	12°C	hold.	Reactions	were	then	run	on	2%	agarose	gels	and	imaged	with	28	
GelGreen	dye	according	to	manufacturer’s	instructions	(Biotium).	For	a	list	of	all	primers	29

K	stock	solution	was	added	to	each	reaction	and	incubated	at	56°C	for	20	mins.	Samples	4	
were	then	boiled	in	2X	SDS	PAGE	sample	buffer	and	separated	on	4-12%	SDS	PAGE	gels.	5	
Gels	were	then	stained	with	0.1%	Alcian	Blue	8GX	in	40%	ethanol/3%	acetic	acid	as	6	
previously	described23.	The	gel	was	then	destained	in	a	40%	ethanol/3%	acetic	acid	and	7	
imaged	on	a	Biorad	ChemiDoc	MP	Imaging	system.		8	
	9	
Whole	genome	sequencing	10	
Genomic	DNA	was	prepped	from	strains	and	sequencing	libraries	were	prepped	via	11	
homopolymer-tail	mediated	ligation	exactly	as	previously	described24.	Single-end	50	bp	12	
reads	were	collected	on	the	Illumina	platform.	Then,	data	was	analyzed	for	small	indels	and	13	
single	nucleotide	variants	using	CLC	Genomics	Workbench	exactly	as	previously	14	
described15,	25.	15	
	16	
Qualitative	and	quantitative	assessment	of	PHB	production		17	
PHB	was	qualitatively	assessed	in	MuGENT	edited	populations	of	V.	natriegens	by	plating	18	
onto	Nile	red	containing	medium	with	excess	glucose	as	a	carbon	source	and	100	μM	IPTG	19	
to	induce	Ptac-containing	genome	edits	=	recipe	per	L:	28	g	instant	ocean,	2.5	g	tryptone,	1	g	20	
yeast	extract,	20	g	glucose,	15	g	agar,	and	1	mg	Nile	red.	Fluorescence	of	colonies	was	21	
detected	using	a	PrepOne	Sapphire	LED	blue	light	base	(475	nm	±	30	nm)	and	amber	filter	22	
(530	nm	long	pass)	(Embi	Tec).		23	
	24	
For	quantitative	assessment	of	PHB	levels,	the	indicated	strains	were	grown	overnight	in	25	
M9	minimal	medium	(BD)	supplemented	with	2	mM	MgSO4,	100	μM	CaCl2,	200	mM	NaCl,	26	
30	μM	FeSO4,	100	μM	IPTG,	1%	tryptone,	and	2%	glucose.	Approximately	8	×	109	cells	were	27	
then	pelleted,	resuspended	with	50	μL	water	and	transferred	to	pre-weighed	glass	screw-28	
cap	tubes.	Cell	suspensions	were	dried	for	5	h	at	80°C	and	then	the	tubes	were	weighed	29	
again	to	determine	dry	cell	weights.	PHB	was	then	hydrolyzed	and	extracted	as	crotonic	30	
acid	by	boiling	the	dried	cells	in	1	ml	of	pure	sulfuric	acid.	Extracts	were	chilled	on	ice	and	31

Supplementary	protocol:	Natural	transformation	/	MuGENT	in	
V.	natriegens	
	
Materials:	
1. LBv2	=	Mix	400	mL	LB	+	32	mL	sterile	5	M	NaCl	+	3.4	mL	sterile	1	M	KCl	+	18.5	mL	
sterile	1	M	MgCl2	
2. 2XIO	=	28	g/L	of	instant	ocean	sea	salts	(www.instantocean.com)	
3. Transforming	DNA	(tDNA)	–		
a. selected	product	=	mutant	construct	that	has	a	selectable	marker	(antibiotic	
resistance	cassette)	that	replaces	the	gene	of	interest	or	a	neutral	locus	(for	
MuGENT).	Homology	on	each	side	of	the	mutation	can	be	as	little	as	0.5	kb.	
Homology	of	3	kb	on	either	side	of	the	mutation	results	in	the	highest	
transformation	efficiencies.		
b. Unselected	product	(cotransformation	/	MuGENT)	=	mutant	construct	that	
lacks	any	selectable	marker	but	has	a	mutation	of	interest	(deletion,	point	
mutation,	promoter	swap,	etc.).	Unselected	products	should	have	3	kb	of	
homology	on	each	side	of	the	mutation	for	the	highest	rates	of	
cotransformation	/	MuGENT.	
	
Notes:	
1. Carb100	=	Carbenicillin	100	µg/mL	
2. SAD1306	=	V.	natriegens	RifR	14048	pMMB67EH-tfoX	
3. The	pMMB67EH-tfoX	plasmid	is	very	stable	in	V.	natriegens,	therefore,	Carbenicillin	
(Carb)	is	not	needed	to	maintain	it	throughout	the	transformation	protocol.		
	
Procedure:	
1. Inoculate	3	mL	of	LBv2+Carb100+100	µM	IPTG	in	a	culture	tube	with	SAD1306.	
Grow	at	30°C	in	rollerdrum	overnight	(12-18	hours).		
2. Next	day,	take	culture	out	of	incubator	and	measure	OD600.	Generally,	our	overnights	
are	at	an	OD600	of	between	7-10.		
3. For	each	transformation	reaction,	take	3.5	μL	of	the	overnight	culture	and	dilute	
into	350	μL	of	2XIO+100	µM	IPTG	(no	Carb).	Invert	gently	to	mix.	Be	sure	to	also	
prep	a	“no	DNA”	control	reaction.		
4. Add	tDNA	to	each	reaction	and	invert	gently	to	mix:	
a. For	a	selected	product	(i.e.	a	product	that	has	an	antibiotic	resistance	
marker)	=	~5-50	ng	yields	thousands	of	colonies.		
b. For	cotransformation	/	MuGENT	=	use	50	ng	of	a	selected	product	and	~200	
ng	of	each	unselected	product	
5. Incubate	reactions	at	30°C	statically	for	4-6	hours.	
6. Next,	add	1mL	LBv2	(no	drug)	to	each	transformation	reaction	and	outgrow	at	30°C	
shaking	for	1-2	hours	
7. To	determine	the	transformation	efficiency:		
a. Plate	all	reactions	for	quantitative	culture	on	media	to	select	for	the	
transformants	(i.e.	on	antibiotic	plates	that	select	for	integration	of	selected

product)	and	on	plates	without	any	drug	to	determine	the	total	CFU	in	the	
culture.		
b. Transformation	efficiency	=	transformants	CFU	/	total	CFU	
8. For	cotransformation	/	MuGENT:		
a. Plate	onto	media	to	select	for	integration	of	the	selected	product.		
b. Pick	single	colonies	and	screen	by	MASC-PCR	to	identify	clones	with	the	
desired	genome	edits.	
c. To	perform	a	subsequent	round	of	MuGENT,	~200	µL	of	the	outgrown	
transformation	can	be	inoculated	into	3	mL	of	LBv2+Carb100+100	µM	
IPTG+the	antibiotic	that	selects	for	integration	of	the	selected	product	(e.g.	if	
Δdns::KanR	was	used	in	the	first	cycle	of	MuGENT,	then	50	µg/mL	Kan	would	
be	included	in	this	overnight	culture).	Start	at	“step	2”	of	this	procedure	to	
perform	the	next	cycle	of	MuGENT	being	sure	to	use	a	selected	product	with	
a	distinct	AbR	marker.
