Since ‚ÄúPrecision Medicine‚Äù was initially launched by Pres-
ident Obama, it presents a huge challenge and chance for
the computational biology and biomedicine. In recent years,
computational methods appeared vastly in the biomedicine
and bioinformatics research, including medical image analy-
sis, healthcare informatics, and cancer genomics. Lots of pre-
diction andmining works were required on the medical data,
such as tumor images, electronicmedical records,microarray,
and GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) data. There-
fore, a growing number of data mining algorithms were
employed in the prediction tasks of computational biology
and biomedicine.
Advanced data mining techniques have also been devel-
oped quickly in recent years. Several impacted new methods
were reported in the top journals and conferences. For
example, affinity propagation was published in Science as
a novel clustering algorithm. Recently, deep learning seems
to be suitable for big data and is becoming the next hot
topic. Parallelmechanism is also developed by the scholar and
industry researchers, such as Mahout. A growing number of
computer scientists are devoted to the advanced large scale
datamining techniques.However, application in biomedicine
has not fully been addressed and fell behind the technique
growth.
This special issue targeted the recent large scale data min-
ing techniques together with biomedicine application and
provided a platform for researchers to exchange their inno-
vative ideas and real biomedical data. We have received 25
manuscripts from Asia, Europe, and America, of which 21
papers were accepted. We categorize three subtopics for our
special issue.
The first part contains 5 papers that are related to bio-
medicine images.The paper ‚ÄúConvolutional Deep Belief Net-
works for Single-Cell/Object Tracking in Computational Bio-
logy and Computer Vision‚Äù proposed a convolutional deep
belief network based architecture to dynamically learn the
most discriminative features from data for both single-cell
and object tracking in computational biology, cell biology,
and computer vision. The paper ‚ÄúObjective Ventricle Segme-
ntation in Brain CTwith Ischemic Stroke Based on Anatomi-
cal Knowledge‚Äù proposed detection system of ischemic stroke
in CT, which can exclude the stroke regions from segmenta-
tion result with a combined segmentation strategy.The paper
‚ÄúSegmentation of MRI Brain Images with an Improved Har-
mony Searching Algorithm‚Äù proposed a modified algorithm
to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. First, a rough set
algorithm was employed to improve the convergence and
accuracy of the HS algorithm. Then, the optimal value was
obtained using the improved HS algorithm. The optimal
value of convergence was employed as the initial value of
the fuzzy clustering algorithm for segmentingmagnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) brain images. The paper ‚ÄúFunctional
Region Annotation of Liver CT Image Based on Vascular
Tree‚Äù proposed a vessel-tree-based liver annotation method
for CT images based on the topological graph. A hierarchical
vascular tree is constructed to divide the liver into eight

Networks‚Äù proposed a polynomial-time computable metric
on the space of partly reduced phylogenetic networks based
on the equivalent nodes, whose space is much closer to the
space of rooted phylogenetic networks than the others. The
paper ‚ÄúStatistical Approaches for the Construction and Inter-
pretation of Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network‚Äù
established a reliable human protein-protein interaction net-
work and developed computational tools to characterize a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, where confidence
measures were assigned to each derived interacting pair and
account for the confidence in the network analysis.The paper

tein (GABAARs and non-GABAARs) sequence information

Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Random Forest, libSVM,

DNA methylation data, the paper ‚ÄúUncovering Driver DNA
Methylation Events in Nonsmoking Early Stage Lung Adeno-
carcinoma‚Äù proposed a bioinformatics pipeline of differential
network analysis to uncover driver methylation genes and
responsive DNA methylation-mediated modules contribut-

sequence analysis. The paper ‚ÄúAnalysis of Important Gene
Ontology Terms and Biological Pathways Related to Pancre-
atic Cancer‚Äù investigated the pancreatic cancer by extracting
important related GO terms and KEGG pathways. The
enrichment theory of GO andKEGGpathwaywas adopted to
encode the validated genes and other genes. And the mRMR

term and KEGG pathway. Furthermore, the obtained GO
terms and KEGG pathways were extensively analyzed. The

dren Development Using Gait Signal Dynamics Parameters
