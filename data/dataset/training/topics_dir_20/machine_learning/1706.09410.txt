GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RESTRICTED
ISOMETRY PROPERTY. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK
MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
Abstract. The restricted isometry property (RIP) is an integral tool in the analysis of
various inverse problems with sparsity models. Motivated by the applications of com-
pressed sensing and dimensionality reduction of low-rank tensors, we propose generalized
notions of sparsity and provide a unified framework for the corresponding RIP, in par-
ticular when combined with isotropic group actions. Our results extend an approach
by Rudelson and Vershynin to a much broader context including commutative and non-
commutative function spaces. Moreover, our Banach space notion of sparsity applies to
affine group actions. The generalized approach in particular applies to high order tensor
products.
1. Introduction
The restricted isometry property (RIP) has been used as a universal tool in the analysis
of many modern inverse problems with sparsity prior models. Indeed, the RIP implies that
certain linear maps act as near isometries when restricted to “nice” (or sparse) vectors.
Motivated from emerging big data applications such as compressed sensing or dimension-
ality reduction of massively sized data with a low-rank tensor structure, we provide a
unified framework for the RIP allowing a generalized notion of sparsity and extend the
existing theory to a much broader context.
Let us recall that in compressed sensing the RIP played a crucial role in provid-
ing guarantees for the recovery of sparse vectors from a small number of observations.
Moreover, these guarantees were achieved by practical polynomial time algorithms (e.g.,
[CT05, RV08]). In machine learning, the RIP enabled a fast and guaranteed dimension-
ality reduction of data with a sparsity structure. The notion of sparsity has been shown
for various sparsity models and in many cases the RIP turns out to be nearly optimal in
terms of scaling of parameters for several classes of random linear operators. For example,
a linear map with random subgaussian entries satisfies a near optimal RIP for the canon-
ical sparsity model [CT05, BDDW08, KMR14], low-rank matrix model [RFP10, CP11b],
and low-rank tensor model [RSS16]. Baraniuk et al. [BDDW08] provided an alternative
elementary derivation that combines exponential concentration of a subgaussian quadratic
form and standard geometric argument with union bounds.

Linear operators with special structures such as subsampled Fourier transform arise in
practical applications. These structures are naturally given by the physics of applications
(e.g., Fourier imaging) and subsampled versions of these structured linear operators can be
implemented within existing physical systems. Furthermore, structured linear operators
also enable scalable implementation at low computational cost, which is highly desirable
for dimensionality reduction. It has been shown that a partial Fourier operator satisfies a
near optimal RIP for the canonical sparsity model in the context of compressed sensing
[CT06, RV08, Rau10]. For another example, quantum tomography, the linear operator for
randomly subsampled Pauli measurements was shown to satisfy a near optimal RIP for a
low-rank matrix model [Liu11].
There are applications whose setup doesn’t fit in the existing theory because the classical
sparsity model does not hold and/or assumptions on the linear operator are not satisfied.
Motivated by such applications, in this paper, we extend the notion of sparsity and RIP
for structured linear operator in several ways described below.
1.1. Generalized notion of sparsity. First, we generalize the notion of sparsity. Let H
be a Hilbert space and K ⊂ H be a centered convex body. We will consider the Banach
space (X, ‖ · ‖X) obtained by completing the linear span of K with the norm ‖ · ‖X given
as the Minkowski functional pK(·) : X → R defined by pK(x) := inf{λ > 0 | x ∈ λK}.
Definition 1.1. We say that a vector x ∈ H is (K, s)-sparse if
‖x‖X ≤
√
s‖x‖H ,
where X is the Banach space with unit ball K.
The set of (K, s)-sparse unit-norm vector in H, denoted by Ks, is geometrically given
as the intersection of
√
sK and the unit sphere S = {x | ‖x‖H = 1}. Then the set of
(K, s)-sparse vectors, denoted by Γs, is the star-shaped nonconvex cone given by RKs (or
CKs if the scalar field is complex). These two sets are visualized in Figure 1. For example,
if H = `N2 and X = `
N
1 , then Γs corresponds to the set of approximately s-sparse vectors
with respect to the canonical basis. The authors of this paper showed that existing near
optimal RIP results extend from the exact canonical sparsity model to this approximately
sparse model [JL15]. This generalized notion of sparsity covers a wider class of models
beyond the classical atomic model. For example, in a companion Part II paper [JL17,
Section 4], we demonstrate a case where a sparse vector is not represented as a finite
linear combination of atoms. It also allows a machinery that optimizes sample complexity
for the RIP of a given atomic sparsity model by choosing an appropriate Banach space

K and the unit sphere S in a Hilbert space H. Left: Set of s-sparse unit-
norm vectors Ks (red). Right: Set of s-sparse vectors Γs (gray-shaded).
(see [JL17, Section 2]). In a special case, where the sparsity level s is 1, our theory covers
an arbitrary set.1
1.2. Vector-valued measurements. Second, we consider vector-valued measurements
which generalize the conventional scalar valued measurements. This situation arises in sev-
eral practical applications. For example, in medical imaging and multi-dimensional signal
acquisition, measurements are taken by sampling transform of the input not individually
but in blocks. The performance of `1 norm minimization has been analyzed in this setup
[PDG15, BBW16] and it was shown that block sampling scheme, enforced by applications,
adds a penalty to the number of measurements for the recovery. This analysis extends
the noiseless part of the analogous theory for the scalar valued measurements [CP11a],
which relies on a property called local isometry, which is a weaker version of the RIP. For
stable recovery from noisy measurements, one essentially needs the RIP of the measure-
ment operator but block sampling setup does not fit to existing RIP results for structured
linear operators. In this paper, we will consider general vector-valued measurements in a
Hilbert space and generalize the notion of incoherence and other properties accordingly.
This extension, in particular combined with a generalized sparsity model, requires the use
of theory of factorization of a linear operator in Banach spaces [Pis86a].
1.3. Sparsity with enough symmetries and group structured RIP.
We also generalize the theory of the RIP for partial Fourier measurement operators
to more general group structured measurement operators, which will exploit the inherent
structure in the Banach space that determines a sparsity model. The canonical sparsity
model is an examples of our general sparsity model in Section 1.1, where the convex set
K has a special structure called enough symmetries. Let G be a group and σ : G → ON
1Note that taking the convex hull of a given set does not increase the number of measurements for RIP.
Therefore, the convex set K can be considered as the convex hull of a given set of interest in this case.

be an affine representation that maps an element in G to the orthogonal group in RN . An
affine representation is isotropic if averaging the conjugate actions on any linear operator
becomes a scalar multiple of the identity. A convex set K has enough symmetries if
there exists an isotropic affine representation such that σ(g)K = K for all g ∈ G. Finite
dimensional Banach spaces with enough symmetries have been studied extensively (see
[TJ89, DF92, Pis86a]). Our original motivation for this problem comes from considering
the low-rank tensor product in `n2 ⊗π `n2 ⊗π `n2 . In fact a nice feature of spaces with enough
symmetries comes from their stability under tensor products.
Under the enough symmetry of K, we consider a linear operator v : X → `m2 given as the
composition map (vj)1≤j≤m given by sampling the (adjoint) orbit Orb(G) = {σ(g)∗η | g ∈
G} of η ∈ X∗, i.e. vj(x) = 〈η, σ(gj)x〉 for x ∈ X and j = 1, . . . ,m, where (gj)1≤j≤m ⊂ G.
For certain class of groups, the group structured measurement operator A = 1√
m
(vj)1≤j≤m
has fast implementation. For example, if η = [1, . . . , 1]> ∈ RN , then A : CN → Cm reduces
to a partial discrete Fourier transform. If the group actions consist of circular shifts in the
canonical basis and in the Fourier basis, then A corresponds to a partial quantum Fourier
transform, which is a special case of the Gabor transform. We will demonstrate the RIP
of this group structured measurement operators when the group elements are randomly
selected.
Again, the group structured measurement operator is a natural extension of a partial
Fourier operator. Unlike the other extension to subsampled bounded orthogonal system
[Rau10], the group structured measurement operator is tightly connected to a given spar-
sity model.
1.4. Main results. We illustrate our main results in the general setup with two con-
crete examples in the two theorems below. These theorems provide the RIP of a random
group structured measurement operator respectively for the corresponding stylized spar-
sity models. Both theorems assume that H = `N2 and the convex set K, which determines
the set of s-sparse vectors Γs, has enough symmetry with an isotropic affine representa-
tion σ : G → ON and X is the Banach space induced from K so that K is the unit ball
in X as before. A set of random measurements are obtained by using random group ac-
tions. Specifically, we assume that g1, . . . , gm are independent copies of a Haar-distributed
random variable g on G.
The first theorem demonstrates our main result in the case where K is a polytope given
as an absolute convex hull of finitely many vectors.
Theorem 1.2 (Polytope). Suppose that X be an N -dimensional Banach space where its
unit ball K is an absolute convex hull of M points. Let Ks be defined from K as before

∣∣∣ ≤ max(δ, δ2)
holds with high probability for m = O(δ−2s‖u : X → `d2‖2(1+lnm)(1+lnmd)2(1+lnM)).
Theorem 1.2 generalizes the RIP result of a partial Fourier operator (e.g., [RV08]) in
the three ways discussed above. The operator norm of v in Theorem 1.2 generalizes
the notion of incoherence in existing theory. Most interestingly, combined with a clever
net argument, Theorem 1.2 enables the RIP of a random group structured measurement
operator for low-rank tensors (See Section 6).
The second theorem deals with the sparsity model with respect to a “nice” Banach
space whose norm dual has type p [Pis99]. (Details are explained in Section 3.3.) Here for
simplicity we only demonstrate an example where p = 2.
Theorem 1.3 (Dual of type 2). Suppose that X is an N -dimensional Banach space such
that its norm dual X∗ has type 2. Let Ks be defined from the unit ball K in X as before
and η ∈ CN satisfy ‖η‖2 =

holds with high probability for m = O(δ−2sT2(X
∗)6‖η‖X∗(1 + lnm)3), where T2(X∗) de-
notes the type 2 constant of X∗.
Theorem 1.3 covers many known results on the RIP of structured random linear operator
and should be considered as an umbrella result for this theory. Importantly Theorem 1.3
applies to noncommutative cases such as Schatten classes and the previous result for a
partial Pauli operator applied to low-rank matrices [Liu11] is a special example.
In fact, Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 are just exemplar of the main result in full generality in
Theorem 2.1. In the Part II paper [JL17], we also demonstrate that Theorem 2.1 provides
theory for the RIP for infinite dimensional sparsity models.
1.5. Notation. In this paper, the symbols c, c1, c2, . . . and C,C1, C2, . . . will be reserved
for numerical constants, which might vary from line to line. We will use notation for
various Banach spaces and norms. The operator norm will be denoted by ‖ · ‖. We will
use the shorthand notation ‖ · ‖p for the `p-norm for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. For N ∈ IN, the unit
ball in `Np will be denoted by B
N
p . For set I ⊂ Z, let (ej)j∈I denote the canonical basis
for C|I|. The index set I should be clear from the context. The identity operator will be

denoted by Id. For set S of linear operators, the commutant, denoted by S ′, refers to the
set of linear operators those commute with all elements in S, i.e.
S ′ = {T | TS = ST, ∀S ∈ S}.
1.6. Organization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The main theorems are
proved in Section 2. We discuss the complexity of the convex set K for various sparsity
models in Section 3. After a brief review of affine group representations and enough
symmetries in Section 4, by collecting the results from the previous sections, we illustrate
the implication of the main results for prototype sparsity models in Section 5. Finally, we
conclude the paper with the application of the main results for a low-rank tensor model
in Section 6.
2. Rudelson-Vershynin method
In this section, we derive a unified framework that identifies a sufficient number of
measurements for the RIP of structured random operators in the general setup introduced
in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. We will start with the statement of the property in the general
setup, followed by the proof.
2.1. RIP in the general setup. Let H be a Hilbert spaces and K ⊂ H be a centrally
symmetric convex set andX be the Banach space with unit ballK as before. Let Γs = {x ∈
X | ‖x‖X ≤
√
s‖x‖H} denote the set of (K, s)-sparse vectors and Ks be the intersection
of Γs and the unit sphere in H. Let v1, . . . , vm be independent random linear operator
from X to `d2. For notational simplicity, we let v : X → `m∞(`d2) denote the composite map
(vj)1≤j≤m defined by (vj)1≤j≤m(x) = (vj(x))1≤j≤m for x ∈ X. Then the measurement
operator A : X → `m∞(`d2), defined by A = 1√m(vj)1≤j≤m, generates a set of m vector
valued linear measurements in `d2.
Our results are stated for a class of incoherent random measurement operators. We
adopt the arguments by Candes and Plan [CP11a] to describe these measurement oper-
ators. In the special case of X = `N1 and d = 1, Candes and Plan considered a class of
linear operators given by measurement maps satisfying the following two key properties.
i) Isotropy: Ev∗j vj = IN for all j = 1, . . . ,m, where IN is the identity matrix of size N ;
ii) Incoherence: ‖vj‖∞ is upper bounded by a numerical constant µ (deterministically or
with high probability). In our setup, the isotropy extends to
(1) Ev∗j vj = Id .
But sometimes we will also consider the case where
(2) Ev∗j vj = Φ, ∀j = 1, . . . ,m,
GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RIP. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK 7
hold with Φ : H → H satisfying
(3) ‖Φ‖ ≤ 1 .
Obviously, the isotropy is a sufficient condition for the relaxed properties in (2) and (3). For
the incoherence, we generalize it using an 1-homogeneous function αd : B(X, `
d
2)→ [0,∞)
that maps a bounded map from X to `d2 to a nonnegative number. A natural choice of
αd is the operator norm, which is consistent with the above example of K = B
N
1 and
d = 1. The operator norm of vj in this case reduces to ‖vj‖X∗ = ‖vj‖∞. However, in
certain scenarios, there exists a better choice of αd than the operator norm that further
reduces the sample complexity that identifies a sufficient number of measurements for the
RIP. One such example is demonstrated for the windowed Fourier transform in the Part
II paper [JL17, Section 2].
Under the relaxed isotropy conditions in (2) and (3), with a slight abuse of terminology,
we say that A satisfies the RIP on Γs with constant δ if
(4) sup
x∈Ks
∣∣∣‖Ax‖2`m2 (`d2) − 〈x,Φx〉∣∣∣ ≤ max(δ, δ2) .
In the special case where the isotropy (Φ = Id) is satisfied, the deviation inequality in (4)
reduces to the conventional RIP. Note that Φ is a nonnegative operator by construction.
If Φ is a positive operator, then 〈x,Φx〉 is a weighted norm of x and (4) preserves this
weighted norm through w with a small perturbation proportional to ‖x‖2H .
Our main result is a far reaching generalization of the RIP of a partial Fourier operator
by Rudelson and Vershynin [RV08]. We adapt their derivation that consists of the following
two steps: The first step is to show that the expectation of the restricted isometry constant
is upper bounded by the γ2 functional [Tal96] of the restriction set, then by an integral
of the metric entropy number by Dudley’s theorem [LT13]. Later in this section, we show
that the first step extends to the general setup with the upper bound given by

=: E2,1(v) ,
where el(v) denotes the dyadic entropy number of v : X → `m∞(`d2) [CS90]. The second
step is where our theory deviates significantly from the previous work [RV08]. Rudelson
and Vershynin used a variation of Maurey’s empirical method [Car85] to get an upper
bound on the integral in (5) for K being the unit ball in `N1 , which in turn provided a
near optimal sample complexity up to a logarithmic factor. Liu [Liu11] later extended the
result by Rudelson and Vershynin [RV08] to the case of a partial Pauli operator applied
to low-rank matrices via the dual entropy argument by Guédon et al. [GMPTJ08].

Our result is further generalization of these results. In particular, our result provides
flexibility that can address the vector-valued measurement case and optimize sample com-
plexity over the choice of the 1-homogeneous function αd on B(X, `
d
2). In the general
setup, we need to adopt other tools in Banach space theory to get an analogous upper
bound. For this purpose, we introduce a property of the convex set K, defined as follows:
We say that K is of entropy type (p, αd) if there exists a constant Mp,αd(K) such that
(6) E2,1(v) ≤ Mp,αd(K)m
1/2−1/p(1 + lnm)e(p)/2 sup
1≤j≤m
αd(vj)
holds for any composite map v = (vj)1≤j≤m, where the exponent function e(·) is defined
by e(p) = 1 for 1 ≤ p < 2 and e(p) = 3 for p = 2 for technical reasons. In this paper,
Mp,αd(K) will denote the smallest constant that satisfies (6). Note that αd generalizes
the notion of incoherence and Mp,αd represents the complexity of a given sparsity model,
which is discussed in more details in Section 3.
Our main theorem below identifies a sufficient number of measurements for RIP of
random linear operator in the general setup.
Theorem 2.1. Let H, K, X, Γs be defined as above. Suppose that K is of entropy
type (p, αd). Let v1, . . . , vm be independent random maps from X to `
d
2 satisfying (2) and
(3). Let 1 ≤ p ≤ 2 and 0 < ζ < 1. Then there exists a numerical constant c such that
A = 1√
m
(vj)1≤j≤m satisfies the RIP on Γs with constant δ with probability 1− ζ provided

The moment terms in (7) and (8) are essentially probabilistic or deterministic upper
bounds on sup1≤j≤m αd(vj) and sup1≤j≤m ‖vj‖, respectively.2 These two terms extend
the notion of incoherence of measurement functionals with respect to the given sparsity
model. On the other hand, Mp,αd(K) describes the complexity of sparsity model. In many
of well-known examples, Mp,αd(K) reduces to a logarithmic factor. However, if the convex
set K that determines the sparsity model has a bad geometry, there will be a penalty
given by larger Mp,αd(K). These incoherence and complexity parameters are controlled
by a choice of the parameter p and the 1-homogeneous function αd.
2Indeed, a tail bound implies moment bounds by the Markov inequality and the converse can be shown
by direct calculation with Stirling’s approximation of the gamma function. (e.g., see [FR13, Chapter 7].)

Remark 2.2. A natural choice for the parameters in Theorem 2.1 is p = 2 and αd = ‖ · ‖.
Then the conditions in (7) and (8) reduces to

However, as shown in [JL17, Section 2], there are cases where we can further reduce the
number of measurements for the RIP in (7) by optimizing over K, p, and αd.
2.2. Proof of Theorem 2.1.
Next we prove Theorem 2.1. In the course of the proof, we show that the Rudelson-
Vershynin argument [RV08] to derive a near optimal RIP of partial Fourier operators
generalizes to a flexible method. Let us start with recalling the relevant notation. Let
T : X → Y be a linear map and D be a subset of X. The dyadic entropy number [CS90]
is defined by
el(T,D) := inf{ε > 0 | N(T (D), εBY ) ≤ 2l−1} .
For D = BX , we use the shorthand notation el(T ) = el(T,BX). The following equivalence
between metric and dyadic entropy numbers is well known (see e.g., [Pis99]).
Lemma 2.3 ([Pis99]).

coincides with the
norm of (el(T ))l∈N in the Lorentz sequence space `(2, 1) [BL76]. Therefore, we will use

The following lemma provides a key estimate in proving Theorem 2.1.
Lemma 2.4. Let H, K, X, and Ks be defined as before. Let D ⊂ Ks. Let v1, . . . , vm be
linear maps from X to `d2 and v = (vj)1≤j≤m denote the composite map. Let ξ1, . . . , ξm be

3. Complexity of sparsity models
Our generalized sparsity model is given by scaled versions of a convex set K. A sufficient
number of measurements for the RIP is determined by the geometry of the resulting
Banach spaceX. In this section, we discuss the complexity ofK given in terms ofMp,αd(K)
for various sparsity models.
3.1. Relaxed canonical sparsity.
In many applications sparsity is implicitly controlled by the `1 norm. A relaxed canon-
ical sparsity model, which includes exactly sparse vectors and their approximation with
small perturbation, is defined by K = BN1 . Then the corresponding Banach space is
X = `N1 . We derive an upper bound on M2,‖·‖(B
N
1 ) by using a well known application of
Maurey’s empirical method, which is given in the following lemma.
Lemma 3.1. (Maurey’s empirical method) Let m,n ∈ IN, H be a Hilbert space, and
v : `N1 → `m∞(H). Then
√
lel(v) ≤ c‖v‖
√
(1 + ln(N/l))(1 + lnm) .
In particular, for dim(H) = d,
E2,1(v) ≤ C
√
(1 + lnN)(1 + lnm)(1 + lnm+ ln d)‖v‖ .
Proof. The first part is a direct consequence of Maurey’s empirical method [Car85, Propo-
sition 2]. Let p ≥ 2 and v′ : `N1 → `mp (H), which satisfies ‖v′‖ ≤ m1/p‖v‖. Since `mp (H)
has type 2 with constant C1
√
p, it follows from [Car85, Proposition 2] that
√
lel(v) ≤
√
lel(v
′) ≤ C2
√
1 + ln(N/l)
√
pm1/p‖v‖.
14 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
Choosing p = 1 + lnm yields the first assertion. Next we prove the second assertion. For
l < m2d2, the first assertion implies

el(v)√
l

c
√
(1 + lnN)(1 + lnm)‖v‖
l
≤ C
√
(1 + lnN)(1 + lnm)(1 + lnm+ ln d)‖v‖.
For l ≥ m2d2, by the standard volume argument ([Pis86b, Lemma 1.7]), we have el(Id`m∞(H)) ≤
md/l. Therefore,
∞∑
l=m2d2
el(v)√

el(Id`m∞(H))‖v‖√
l

∞∑
l=m2d2
md‖v‖

≤ 2‖v‖ .
This completes the proof. 
Proposition 3.2. Let αd(u) = ‖u : `N1 → `d2‖. Then
M2,αd(B
N
1 ) ≤ C
√
1 + lnN(1 + ln d) .
Proof. According to Lemma 3.1 we have
sup
k∈N
√
kek(v : `
N
1 → `m∞(`d2)) ≤ c‖v‖
√
1 + lnN
√
1 + lnm
and
E2,1(v) ≤ c
√
1 + lnN(1 + ln dm)
√
1 + lnm‖u‖
≤ C(1 + ln d)
√
1 + lnN(1 + lnm)3/2‖u‖ .
The assertion follows from the definition in (6). 
3.2. Relaxed atomic sparsity with finite dictionary.
We say that a vector is atomic s-sparse if x is represented as a finite linear combination
of a given set of atoms, which is called a dictionary. Here we consider a special case where
the dictionary is a finite set {xk | 1 ≤ k ≤ M} ⊂ BN2 . A relaxed atomic sparsity model
is defined by the convex hull of the dictionary, i.e. K = absconv{xk | 1 ≤ k ≤ M}. As
mentioned in the introduction, it is important to observe if the point xi’s are in the unit
sphere SN−1, then the “sparse” set Ks =
√
sK ∩ SN−1 is no longer in a convex hull of a
set with few vectors from the unit sphere. Then the complexity of K is upper bounded
by the following corollary.
Corollary 3.3. Let K = absconv{xj | 1 ≤ j ≤M} and αd(u) = ‖u : X → `d2‖. Then
M2,αd(K) ≤ C
√
1 + lnM(1 + ln d) .
GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RIP. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK 15
Proof. Let v = (vj)1≤j≤m. Then we have
max
1≤j≤M
αd(vj) = ‖v : X → `m∞(`d2)‖ .
Define Q : `M1 → X so that Q(ek) = xk for all k = 1, . . . ,M , where e1, . . . , eM are
standard basis vectors in RM . Then ‖Q : `M1 → X‖ ≤ 1. Therefore,
‖vjQ : `M1 → `d2‖ ≤ ‖vj : X → `d2‖ , ∀j = 1, . . . ,M .
By Lemma 3.1, we have
E2,1(vQ : `M1 → `m∞(`d2)) ≤ C
√
(1 + lnM)(1 + lnm)(1 + lnmd)‖v : X → `m∞(`d2)‖ ,
Thus Proposition 3.2 applies. Indeed, entropy numbers are surjective, i.e.
ek(vQ) = ek(v : X → Y )
for any Banach space Y . Therefore, the estimate in Corollary 3.3 is as tight as that in
Lemma 3.2. 
3.3. Norm dual of type-p Banach spaces.
Next we consider the scenario where the norm dual X∗ has type p. Let us recall that
a Banach space X has type p if there exists a constant C such that for all finite sequence
(xj) in X
(13)
(

)1/p
,
where (εj) is a Rademacher sequence [Pis99]. The type p constant of X, denoted by
Tp(X), is the smallest constant C that satisfies (13). Let αd be the operator norm. Then
Maurey’s method implies that K has type (p, αd) if X
∗ has type p, which will be shown
using the following lemma.
Lemma 3.4. Let X be a Banach space such that X∗ has type 1 < p < 2 and v : X → `m∞.
Then
∞∑
k=1
ek(v)√
k
≤ c(p)Tp(X∗)p
′+1‖v‖m1/p−1/2(1 + lnm)1/2 ,
where c(p) is a constant that only depends on p. Moreover, for p = 2,
∞∑
k=1
ek(v)√
k
≤ cT2(X∗)3‖v‖(1 + lnm)3/2
for a numerical constant c.
The following corollary is a direct consequence of Lemma 3.4.
16 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
Corollary 3.5. By definition, if X∗ is of type p for 1 < p < 2, then
Mp,‖·‖(K) ≤ c(p)Tp(X∗)p
′+1m2/p−1(1 + lnm)1/2 .
For p = 2,
M2,‖·‖(K) ≤ cT2(X∗)3(1 + lnm)3/2 .
Proof of Lemma 3.4. Let v∗ : `m1 → X∗ denote the adjoint of v. Then Maurey’s empirical
method [Car85] implies
ek(v
∗) ≤ cTp(X∗)‖v‖
(
lnm
k
)1/p′
.
Moreover the duality of entropy numbers [BPSTJ89, Proposition 4 and Lemma C] implies
that for all l ∈ N
l∑
k=1
ek(v) ≤ (CTp(X∗))p
′
l∑
k=1
ek(v

for a numerical constant C. Using Hardy’s inequalities (e.g., [Pie80]), this implies

On the other hand, by the standard volume argument, we have ek(Id`m1 ) ≤ e
−ck/m. Now
we use the fact that∫ ∞
b
x−1/2e−x/adx = a1/2
∫ ∞
b/a
y−1/2e−ydy ≤ cab−1/2e−b/a
holds for b/a ≥ 2. Therefore cl/m ≥ 2 implies∑
k ≥ l
k−1/2e−ck/m ≤ m
l1/2
e−cl/m .
Thus for l = m
√
lnm this is bounded by a constant. Thus we deduce from ek(v) ≤

Let c(p) = c(1/2 − 1/p′)−1Cp′ . This proves the first part. For p = 2, we let l = lnm +
ln lnm ≤ 2 lnm in splitting
∑∞

method. 
3.4. Unconditional basis and lattices.
Let us first consider the case where X is a finite dimensional Banach lattice. Let us
recall that the unit ball K of a lattice X in RN is a convex symmetric set such that
(14) Dε(K) = K
holds for all ε ∈ {−1, 1}N , where Dε is a diagonal operator that performs the element-wise
multiplication with ε. In the complex case we require this condition for all ε ∈ TN , where
T denotes the set of unit modulus complex numbers. Equivalently, the norm ‖ · ‖X given
as the Minkowski functional of K satisfies
‖(xi)1≤i≤N‖X = ‖(|xi|1≤i≤N )‖X .
Remark 3.6. The abstract definition of a Banach lattice is more involved. In practical
purpose, we may always assume that a lattice is given by a norm on measurable function
f on (0,∞) or [0, 1] such that
‖|f |‖X = ‖f‖X ,
where |f | is defined by |f |(t) = |f(t)| for all t in the domain of f . (See [LT96] for more
details.) In this setup, all arguments in this section also apply to infinite dimensional
Banach lattices.
For k ∈ IN, let γk∞ denote the homogeneous function on the maps u : X → `d2 defined
by
γk∞(u) = inf
u = ab
‖b : X → `k∞‖ ‖a : `k∞ → `d2‖ .
Note that γk∞ is not necessarily a valid norm. The following well-known Lemma is crucial
in our context (see [Pis86a]).
Lemma 3.7. Let X be a lattice as above and u : X → `d2. Then
γ2d∞(u) ≤ C
∥∥∥( d∑
j=1
|u∗(ej)|2
)1/2∥∥∥
X∗
≤ 2C`(u(K)) .
Proof. There exists an isomorphic embedding a : `d2 ↪→ `2d1 due to Kashin (see e.g., [Pis99]).
Since X is a lattice, it follows that X(`d2) is also embedded into X(`
2d
1 ). Moreover, since
`d2 and `
2d
1 are finite dimensional lattices, the dual spaces of X(`
d
2) and X(`
2d
1 ) are given
by X∗(`d2) and X
∗(`2d∞), respectively [LT96]. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, for every
18 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
x∗ = (x∗j )1≤j≤d ∈ X∗(`d2) with ‖x∗‖X∗(`d2) = 1, there exists y
∗ = (y∗i )1≤i≤2d ∈ X∗(`2d∞) that
satisfies ‖y∗‖X∗(`2d∞) ≤ C1 for a numerical constant C1 and x
∗ = (Id⊗ a∗)y∗, i.e.
x∗j =
2d∑
i=1
aijy
∗
i , j = 1, . . . , d .
Choose x∗ = (x∗j )1≤j≤d = (u
∗(ej))1≤j≤d. Then let y
∗ = (y∗i )1≤i≤2d be the extension of
x∗ as above. Define a linear operator φ : X → `2d∞ by φ(x) = (〈y∗i , x〉)1≤i≤2d for x ∈ X.
Then u is factorized as u = a∗φ. Since X∗(`2d∞) ⊂ `2d∞(X∗), the operator norm of φ is upper
bounded by
‖φ : X → `2d∞‖ = sup
1≤i≤2d
‖y∗i ‖X∗ = ‖y∗‖`2d∞(X∗) ≤ ‖y
∗‖X∗(`2d∞) ≤ C1‖x
∗‖X∗(`d2) .
Therefore,
γ2d∞(u) ≤ C1‖x∗‖X∗(`d2)‖a
∗ : `2d∞ → `d2‖ .
Here ‖a∗ : `2d∞ → `d2‖ is a numerical constant. Note that ‖x∗‖X∗(`d2) is written as
(15) ‖x∗‖X∗(`d2) =
∥∥∥(u∗(ej))dj=1∥∥∥
X∗(`d2)
=
∥∥∥( d∑

.
This proves the first assertion. Finally, by Khintchine’s inequality, the last term in (15) is
upper bounded by∥∥∥( d∑

.

Proof. Let (vj)
m
j=1 be maps with αd(vj) ≤ 1. Then we find a factorization vj = ajbj with
‖bj : X → `2d∞‖ ≤ 1 and ‖aj : `2d∞ → `d2‖ ≤ C. This allows us to define b = (bj) : X → `2md∞
given by the blocks. Similarly, we may define the block diagonal map a = (aj) : `

′+1(2md)1/p−1/2(1 + ln(md))e(p)/2 .
Using v = ab implies the assertion. 
3.5. Schatten classes.
Schatten p-classes are examples of noncommutative Lp spaces. In that sense, we should
expect that the results from the previous section extend to those “noncommutative lat-
tices”. In this context the maps v which extract a row or a column from the matrix are
canonical, although not very clever choices, for Hilbert space valued measurements. Let
us also note that just using the operator norm ‖v : Snp → `d2‖ is a “bad” idea. The column
and row projection certainly do not admit any entropy decay.
Before we start estimating the relevant constants, we should mention that for 1 ≤ q ≤ 2
the unit ball BSn1,n2q satisfies
BSn1,n2q ⊂ B
N
2 ,
where N = n1n2. Let us also observe that K = BSn1,n2q has enough symmetries. Indeed,
we have affine isotropic actions of Zn21 and Zn22 respectively as left and right multiplica-
tions, and the argument for tensor products in Section 6 also applies here and shows the
commuting action of Zn21 × Zn22 is also isotropic. An analogue of Lemma 3.7 is stated for
X = Sq. For simplicity of notation, we state our results in the square case (n1 = n2 = n).
The rectangular case can be shown in a similar way.
Lemma 3.9. Let 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 and u : Sq → `d2. Then

Proof. Let us denote by Gdq(X) = {
∑d
j=1 ξj ⊗ xj} ⊂ Lq(Ω, P ;X) the span of the gaussian
vectors and by Gdq(X)
∗ the dual space. In [Pis09, Theorem 1.13] Pisier proved that for
1 ≤ q < 2 the space Gdq ⊂ Lq completely embeds into `cd
2
q for some universal constant
c. This implies that there exists a map a : Gdq ↪→ `cd
2
q which is an 2-isomorphism on
its image so that Gdq(Sq) ↪→ `cd
2
q (Sq). By duality we find that G
d
q(Sq)
∗ is a quotient of
`cd
2
q′ (Sq′). Therefore, for every x
∗ = (x∗j )1≤j≤d ∈ Gdq(Sq)∗ with ‖x∗‖Gdq(Sq)∗ = 1, there exists
y∗ = (y∗i )1≤i≤cd2 ∈ `cd
2
q′ (Sq′) that satisfies ‖y∗‖`cd2
q′ (Sq′ )
≤ C1 for a numerical constant C1
and x∗ = (Id ⊗ a∗)y∗. Note that there exists an isometric isomorphism ι : `d2 → (Gdq)∗.
20 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
We pick x∗ = (x∗j )1≤j≤d = (u
∗ι∗ι(ej))1≤j≤d = (u
∗(ej))1≤j≤d and let y
∗ be the image of
x∗ via Id ⊗ a∗ as above. Define φ : Sq → `cd
2
q′ by φ(x) = (〈y∗i , x〉)1≤i≤cd2 for x ∈ Sq.
Let b : Sq → `cd

Dσ : `

2
q′ be a diagonal operator given by σ = (‖y∗i ‖Sq′ )1≤i≤cd2 ∈ `

q′ . Then
‖b‖ ≤ 1 and ‖φ‖ = ‖Dσ‖ = ‖σ‖q′ . In other words, φ is factorized as φ = Dσb so that
‖b‖‖σ‖q′ ≤ ‖φ‖ = ‖y∗‖`cd2
q′ (Sq′ )

This implies u satisfies γcd

constant. The dual space of Gdq(Sq) is well-understood via noncommutative Khintchine
inequalities (see [Pis03]) and the norm is given by the right-hand-side of our assertion for
1 ≤ q ≤ 2. 
Remark 3.10. For q ≥ 2, we expect a similar result using polynomial Λ-cb sets. We
leave the details to a future publication.

M2,αd(Kq) ≤ C(1 + ln d)
3/2(q′)3/2
for q > 1 and M2,αd(K1) ≤ (1 + ln d)3/2(1 + lnn)3/2.
Proof. For v = (vj), we deduce from Lemma 3.4 that
E2,1(v) ≤ c(T2(Sq′))3(1 + lnmcd2)3/2 sup
j
αd(vj)
≤ c(

In fact this estimate is rather rough, it would be better to work with the maximum of
(1 + lnm)3/2 and (1 + ln d)3/2. 
Remark 3.12. We have shown in Section 3.2 that convex hulls generated by few points
induce sparsity models. Our estimate above provides a noncommutative analogue as
follows: Fix k ∈ IN and let Q : Sk1 → `N2 such that∥∥∥( N∑

This replaces the condition xi ∈ BN2 for the commutative space. Let K = Q(BSk1 ). Then
we deduce from Corollary 3.11 that
M2,αd(K) ≤ C(1 + ln d)
3/2(1 + ln k)3/2 .
Of course such a set K need not necessarily have enough symmetries. Let G be a finite
group. Then we may consider the map QG : `
|G|
1 (S
k
1 )→ `N2 given by
QG((xg)) =
∑
g∈G
Q(xg)
and the larger body KG = QG(B
`
|G|
1 (S
k
1 )
). Since `
|G|
1 (S
k
1 ) is isometrically embedded into
S
k|G|
1 , our estimate also implies
M2,αd(K
G) ≤ C(1 + ln d)3/2(1 + ln k + ln |G|)3/2 .
Hence, up to a logarithmic factor of a higher order, the set convex hull KG of the G-orbit
of K satisfies the same estimates as convex combinations of few points. Note however that
for a map Q : `k1 → `N2 we have
‖Q‖ = sup
j
‖Q(ej)‖2 =
∥∥∥( N∑
j=1
|Q∗(ej)|2

,
and hence our noncommutative condition is a suitable generalization of the commutative
case.
4. Sparsity models with enough symmetries
4.1. Banach spaces with enough symmetries.
In many physical situations, one considers particular isometries groups for the underly-
ing configuration space. In the Banach space literature, a space X is called to have enough
symmetries if there is an affine representation σ : G→ L(X) such that
i) ‖σ(g)x‖X = ‖x‖X ;
ii) σ(g)T = Tσ(g), ∀g ∈ G =⇒ T = λId.
In this section we will assume that X is finite dimensional and G is compact. Let us
recall that an affine representation is almost multiplicative, i.e. there exists φ : G×G→
[0, 2π) such that
σ(g)σ(h) = eiφ(g,h)σ(gh) , ∀g, h ∈ G .
These representations are usually obtained from the representation of the Lie algebra.
Affine representations yield an honest group presentations π : G → L(X) by conjugation
so that
π(g)(T ) = σ(g)Tσ(g−1) , ∀g ∈ G, T ∈ L(X) .
22 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
Indeed, we have
π(g)π(h)T = σ(g)σ(h)Tσ(h)−1σ(g)−1
= σ(gh)eiφ(gh)Te−iφ(gh)σ(h−1g−1) = π(gh)T .
The next result is well-known (see e.g. [Pis99, TJ89]), we include a sketch of the proof
for convenience.
Lemma 4.1. Let X be a Banach space of dimension N with enough symmetries with
respect to a compact group G. Then there exists an inner product on X, with corresponding
Hilbert space H, and an affine representation σ : G→ U(H), where U(H) denote the group
of unitary operators on the corresponding Hilbert space H, such that
(16)
∫
G
σ(g)Tσ(g−1)dµ(g) =
tr(T )
N
Id .
Proof. Let α be an ideal norm on L(`N2 , X) and u0 : `
N
2 → X be the Lewis map with
respect to α such that
(17) det(u0) = sup
α(u)≤1
| det(u)| .
Here we have chosen a fixed basis on X ∼= IKN in order to calculate the determinant. Note
that
σ(g)(BX) = BX
implies vol(σ(g)BX) = | det(σ(g))|Nvol(BX) and hence | det(σ(g))| = 1. Thus σ(g)u0
also attains the maximum in (17). Since the ellipsoid E = u0(BN2 ) is unique for any
tensor norm on L(`N2 , X), see [Pis99], we deduce that σ(g)(E) = E . This implies that
u−10 σ(g)u0(B
N
2 ) ⊂ BN2 and hence σ̂(g) = u
−1
0 σ(g)u0 is a contraction in L(`
N
2 ). Applying
this to σ(g−1), which differs from σ(g)−1, up to a scalar of absolute value 1, we deduce
that σ̂(g) is a unitary, i.e. σ̂(g)BN2 = B
N
2 . The Hilbert space H is now obtained from the
norm ‖x‖H = ‖u−10 (x)‖2, and then σ(g) simultaneously preserves the unit ball of X and
is a unitary on H. In particular, the linear map
Φ(T ) =
∫
G
σ(g)Tσ(g−1)dµ(g)
satisfies σ(g0)Φ(T )σ(g
−1
0 ) = Φ(T ) for all g0. Thus Φ(T ) = λ(T )Id, where
λ(T )N = tr(Φ(T )) =
∫
G
tr(σ(g)Tσ(g−1))dµ(g) = tr(T ) .
The assertion follows by normalization. 
GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RIP. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK 23
We see that equivalently an N -dimensional Banach space X with enough symmetries
is given by (CN , ‖ · ‖X , ‖ · ‖H) and an affine representation σ : G→ ON such that σ(g) is
an isometry on X and on H simultaneously.
4.2. Examples of isotropic affine representations.
Let G be a compact group and σ : G → ON be an irreducible representation. Then
σ(G)′ = CId show that (G, σ) is isotropic. Therefore, even for finite groups, it is imprac-
tical to provide an exhaustive list of affine isotropic representations. For concreteness, we
provide a few examples in the following.
4.2.1. Quantum Fourier transform. The smallest group we are aware of is the group Z2N .
Let Sh(er) = er+1 be the cyclic shift and Λ(er) = e
i2πr
N er be the diagonal operator
representing the modulation with the N -th primitive root of unity. Then σ : Z2N → ON
defined by
σ(l, k) = Λl Shk, ∀(l, k) ∈ Z2N
is an affine representation, because
σ(l, k)σ(l′, k′) = Λl Shk Λl
′
Sh−k Shk+k
′
= e
−i2πl′k
N σ(l + l′, k + k′)
satisfies the usual Heisenberg relations. Since Λ is a single generator of the C∗-algebra
`N∞, we see that every matrix a commuting with Λ is a diagonal matrix. Every diagonal
matrix commuting with the shift has constant entries. Thus the commutant of the group
actions is given by (σ(ZN2))′ = CId.
4.2.2. Random sign and shifts. Consider an affine representation σ̃ of G̃ = {−1, 1}N oZN
via diagonal matrices and shift matrices.
Let us show that we deal in fact with a suitable representation. Indeed, let Sh(er) =
er+1. Then
Sh−1DεSh = Dε′
with entries ε′r = εr+1. This means that
σ̃(G̃) =
{
DεSh
k
∣∣∣ ε ∈ {−1, 1}N , k ∈ ZN} ⊂ ON
is a subgroup and the normalized counting measure is the Haar measure. G̃ is indeed the
semi-direct product, and it easily checked that (σ̃G̃)′ = CId.
24 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
4.2.3. Clifford group and Schatten class.
For the Schatten class X = Sn1 we have several interesting choices of group actions.
Indeed let us assume that σ : G→ Un is an affine isotropic action, then σ̃ : G×G→ U(Sn2 )
given by
σ̃(g, g′)(x) = σ(g)xσ(g′)∗
also defines an isotropic action on Sn2 .
Example 4.2. For our quantum unitaries σ(k, j) = ΛkShj we see that the product is again
of the same form so that we may effectively sample with the quantum Fourier transform
matrices as measurement.
Example 4.3. For n = 2k, we may use the standard Clifford generators [Pis03]
crcs + cscr = δrs1 , c
2
r = 1 cr = c
∗
r .
Then we define affine representation σ : {0, 1}k → Un via
σ(ε) =
∏
εk=1
ck .
Here the product is ordered. Note that σ(ε)σ(ε′) = ±σ(εε′). It is easy to check that this
action is isotropic.
Example 4.4. For n = 2, we may use also the Pauli matrices I, ε, J, iεJ given by
I =
(
1 0
0 1
)
, ε =
(
1 0
0 −1
)
, J =
(
0 1
1 0
)
.
Then we find an affine representation σ2 of Z22 on M2, and the tensor product σk2 : Z2k2 →
M⊗k2 = M2k gives exactly the measurements described by Liu [Liu11].
5. RIP via group action
In this section, we illustrate implication of the general RIP result in Theorem 2.1 for
prototype sparsity models when K has enough symmetries with an affine representation
and the measurement operator is group structured accordingly.
5.1. Relaxed atomic sparsity with a finite dictionary.
First, we consider the case where K is a polytope given as an absolute convex hull
of finitely many points. The corresponding sparsity model is is a generalization of the
canonical sparsity model with the unit `1 ball.
GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RIP. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK 25
Theorem 5.1 (Polytope). Under the hypothesis of Theorem 2.1, suppose in addition that
H = `N2 and K is an absolute convex hull of M points, and K has enough symmetry with an
isotropic affine representation σ : G → ON . Let g be a Haar-distributed random variable
on G and g1, . . . , gm be independent copies of g. Let u : X → `d2 satisfy tr(u∗u) = N .
Then there exists a numerical constant c such that A = 1√
m
(uσ(gj))1≤j≤m satisfies the
RIP on Γs with constant δ with probability 1− ζ provided
m ≥ cδ−2smax((1 + lnm)(1 + lnmd)2(1 + lnM), ln(ζ−1))‖u : X → `d2‖2 .
Proof. By the isotropy, we have Eσ(g)∗u∗uσ(g) = Id. Let αd be the operator norm. Then,
since K is G-invariant,
αd(uσ(gj)) = ‖uσ(gj) : X → `d2‖ = ‖u : X → `d2‖ .
Note that ‖u : X → `d2‖ is no longer random. The assertion follows by applying the above
results with the upper bound on M2,‖·‖(K) by Lemma 3.3 to Remark 2.2. 
Remark 5.2. When K is not G invariant, one can show the RIP for
K̃ = absconv{σ(g)xj | 1 ≤ j ≤M, g ∈ G}
instead of K. By construction, K̃ is G invariant. Moreover, since K ⊂ K̃, it follows that
‖x‖
X̃
≤ ‖x‖X for all x ∈ X, where X̃ is the Banach space with unit ball K̃. Therefore
the RIP on Γs(K̃) implies the RIP on Γs. For example, if G = Z2N , then this replacement
of K by K̃ will increase the number of measurements for the RIP in Theorem 5.1 by an
additive term of O(lnN).
In a special case where K = BN1 and d = 1, there is η ∈ X∗ such that the map v is
given by u(x) = 〈η, x〉 for x ∈ X and ‖u : X → `d2‖ reduces to ‖η‖∞. In particular, for η =
[1, . . . , 1]> ∈ RN , we have tr(u∗u) = ‖η‖22 = N and Theorem 5.1 reproduces the known RIP
result for a partial Fourier operator on the canonical sparsity model [RV08, Rau10, Dir15].
5.2. Dual of type-p Banach spaces.
Next we consider the case where the norm dual X∗ has type p and the measurements
are scalar valued (d = 1). Let αd be the operator norm. Then Lemma 3.4 implies that K
has type (p, αd) if X
∗ has type p. Therefore we get the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3 (Dual of type p). Let X be an N -dimensional Banach space such that i)
X∗ has type 1 < p ≤ 2; ii) the unit ball K has enough symmetry given by (CN , ‖·‖X , ‖·‖2)
26 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
and an affine representation σ : G→ ON . Let g be a Haar-distributed random variable on
G and g1, . . . , gm be independent copies of g. Let η ∈ CN such that ‖η‖2 =

Furthermore, since σ(g)(BX) ⊂ BX we deduce that
E sup
1≤j≤m
sup
x∈BX
|〈η, σ(gj)x〉|2q ≤ ‖η‖2qX∗ , ∀q ∈ N .
Lastly, Lemma 3.4 implies that Mp,αd(K) ≤ (1/p − 1/2)−1(CTp(X∗))p
′+1. Hence the
assertion follows from Theorem 2.1. 
Example 5.4. Schatten class Snq of n-by-n square matrices has enough symmetries.
Therefore, Theorem 5.3 provides an alternative proof for a near optimal RIP of partial
Pauli measurements by Liu [Liu11]. Pauli measurements are given as an orbit of the Clif-
ford group with η =
√
nIdCn. Since S
n
∞ is not type 2, let X be S
n
q with q
′ = lnn instead of
Sn1 . Obviously, all rank-s matrices is (K, s)-sparse with K = BSnq in our generalized spar-
sity model. Then T2(X
∗) ≤
√
lnn. In other words, the complexity of K is a logarithmic
term. On the other hand, the incoherence satisfies ‖η‖Sq′ ≤ e‖η‖S∞ = e
√
n and the upper
bound is proportional to n. This large incoherence is the penalty for noncommutativity.
GENERALIZED NOTIONS OF SPARSITY AND RIP. PART I: A UNIFIED FRAMEWORK 27
6. RIP on low-rank tensors
In this section, we apply the main results in previous sections to demonstrate that the
group structured measurement can be useful for dimensionality reduction of higher-order
low-rank tensors. Let N,n, d ∈ N satisfy N = nd. We consider the convex set K ⊂ BN2
given by the convex hull of rank-1 tensors, i.e.
(18) K = absconv{y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ yd | yj ∈ Bn2 , ∀j = 1, . . . , d} .
Note that K is the unit ball of (`n2 )
⊗dπ , which is the tensor product of d copies of `n2 with
respect to the largest tensor norm π. Let G be any compact group with an affine isotropic
action, then the product Gd admits an affine isotropic action which leaves K invariant.
For example, the tensor product representation Zn2d of the quantum Fourier transform
shows that K has enough symmetries.
Lemma 6.1. Let K be defined in (18). There exist rank-1 tensors x1, . . . , xM ∈ BN2 with
lnM ≤ 3nd(1 + ln d) such that K ⊂ e absconv{xj | 1 ≤ j ≤M}.
Proof. Let 0 < ε < 1/2 and ∆ be an ε-net for the unit ball Bn2 . Then we may assume that
|∆| ≤ (1 + 2/ε)n (we consider the real scalar field). It follows that every element y ∈ Bn2
has a representation
y =
∞∑
j=1
αjzj
with zj ∈ ∆ and
∑
j |αj | ≤
1+ε
1−ε ≤ (1 + 3ε). This implies
y1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ yd =
∞∑
j1,...,jd=1
d⊗
l=1
αjlzjl .
Note that
⊗d
l=1 zjl ∈ ∆⊗
d
and
∞∑
j1,...,jd=1
∣∣∣ d∏
l=1
αjl
∣∣∣ ≤ (1 + 3ε)d .
Thus we choose 1/(d+ 1) < 3ε ≤ 1/d and deduce the assertion from
ln |∆⊗d | ≤ nd ln
(
1 +
2
ε
)
≤ nd ln 13d . 
Corollary 6.2. Let X be the Banach space with the unit ball K defined in (18), 0 < ζ < 1,
and ξ ∼ N (0, IN ). Then for all r ∈ N we have
(19) (E‖ξ‖rX∗)1/r ≤ cmax{
√
r,
√
3nd(1 + ln d)} .
28 MARIUS JUNGE AND KIRYUNG LEE
for a numerical constant c. Furthermore,
Prob
(
‖ξ‖X∗ ≥
√
2(1 + 3nd(1 + ln d) + ln(ζ−1))
)
≤ ζ.
Here ‖ · ‖X∗ denotes the dual norm of X.
Proof. By Lemma 6.1, there exists ∆ ⊂ BN2 such that K ⊂ e absconv ∆ and ln |∆| ≤
3nd(1 + ln d). Then
‖ξ‖X∗ = sup
x∈K
|〈x, ξ〉| ≤ e sup
x∈∆
|〈x, ξ〉| .
Let p = 3nd ln d and r ≥ p. Since the net ∆ is contained in the unit ball we deduce
(E‖ξ‖rX∗)1/r ≤ e(E sup
x∈∆
|〈ξ, x〉|r)1/r ≤ e|∆|1/r sup
x∈∆
(E|(ξ, x)|r)1/r ≤ e2
√
r .
For r ≤ p we just use the Lp norm. The second assertion follows by the union bound over
∆. 
Theorem 6.3. Let N = nd, K be given in (18), Ks =
√
sK ∩ SN−1, and ξ N (0, IN ). Let
G be a compact group with an affine isotropic action, g1, . . . , gm be independent random
variables in Gd with respect to the Haar measure, and σ : Gd → ON be a tensor product
representation. Let δ > 0 and 0 < ζ < 1. Then
P
 sup

 ≤ ζ
provided that
m ≥ cδ−2s(1 + lnm)3(1 + 3nd(1 + ln d) + ln(ζ−1))2
holds for a numerical constant c.
Proof. As in the proof of Lemma 6.2, construct ∆ ⊂ BN2 from Lemma 6.1 such that
ln |∆| ≤ 3dn(1 + ln d) and K̃ = e absconv ∆ contains K. Let X̃ be the Banach space
induced from K̃ such that the unit ball in X̃ is K̃. Since K ⊂ K̃, it follows that Ks ⊂√
sK̃ ∩ SN−1. Moreover, we have ‖x‖X∗ ≤ ‖x‖X̃∗ for all x, where ‖ · ‖X̃∗ denotes the dual
norm of X̃. Therefore by Theorem 5.1 the assertion holds if
m ≥ cδ−2smax
(
(1 + lnm)3(1 + lnM), ln(ζ−1)
)
‖η‖2
X̃∗
.
Indeed, according to the proof of Lemma 6.2, the right-hand side of the inequality in (19)
is also a valid upper bound on ‖η‖
X̃∗ . This completes the proof. 

Let us now compare the estimate in Theorem 6.3 to the Gaussian measurement operator.
Let ξ1, . . . , ξm be independent copies of ξ ∼ N (0, IN ). Then by Gordon’s escape through

To simplify the expressions for the number of measurements, let us choose ζ not too
small so that ln(ζ−1) is dominated by the other logarithmic terms and then ignore the
logarithmic terms. While the Gaussian measurement operator provides the RIP with
roughly sndmeasurements, the group structured measurement with a Gaussian instrument
provides the RIP roughly with sn2d2 measurements. However, the suboptimal scaling of
m for the group structured measurement can be compensated by applying a Gaussian
matrix to the obtained measurements (see [JL17, Theorem 4.2]). Since m ≈ sn2d2 is
already significantly small compared to the dimension nd of the ambient space (`n2 )
⊗πd ,
this two step measurement system is much more practical than the measurement system
with a single big Gaussian matrix.
Moreover, besides suboptimal scaling of the number of measurements for the RIP, the
group structured measurement operator has the following advantages. The transforma-
tions σ(g) preserve both the convex body K and the ‖ ‖2 norm. The incoherence in this
case of group structured measurement is determined by the instrument. Lemma 6.2 sug-
gests that a random gaussian vector ξ can be a good choice for the instrument in the
sense that it makes the incoherence parameter small. There exist fast implementations
for certain group action transforms, which enable highly scalable dimensionality reduction
for massively sized tensor data.
