BIOINFORMATICS, BACHELOR
OF SCIENCE (B.S.) WITH
A CONCENTRATION IN
BIOLOGICAL/GENOMIC
This bioinformatics program consists of a core curriculum that provides
the basics of biology, chemistry, computer science and statistics, as well
as an introduction to the field of bioinformatics. The bachelor’s program
in bioinformatics requires breadth of training via VCU Life Sciences’
general education requirements, specific training in the collateral course
work and bioinformatics core, and focused training in the areas of
biology/genomics, computational science or quantitative/statistical
bioinformatics through the concentration-specific courses.
Students wishing to pursue the bioinformatics major must apply for
admission into the program. High school seniors as well as students
transferring to VCU should follow the regular VCU admissions process
and deadlines, being sure to indicate clearly in their application that
they wish to apply to the bioinformatics program. Continuing VCU
students wishing to apply to the program will find information about
the application process at csbc.vcu.edu/bioinformatics-programs/
undergraduate (http://www.csbc.vcu.edu/bioinformatics-programs/
undergraduate) or by calling the director of undergraduate curricula at
(804) 828-0559 or the Center for the Study of Biological Complexity at
(804) 827-0026.
Transfer students and continuing VCU students with at least 15 college
credits should present a suggested college GPA of 3.0 including relevant
course work in science, math or computer science.
Learning outcomes
Upon completing this program, students will know and know how to do
the following:
• Present scientific results, both orally and in writing, in a way that
makes clear to an appropriate target audience the distinction
between what is known (and how) and what is merely suspected
between an observation and a conclusion in a way that tells a
compelling story
• Will have demonstrated fundamental knowledge of the basic
concepts of biology (particularly molecular biology), the physical
sciences, mathematics, statistics and computational science and the
ability to apply that knowledge within the context of bioinformatics
• Will have demonstrated an ability to identify and analyze
bioinformatics problems and strategies to solve said problems
• Will possess an appropriate level of technical knowledge and ability
necessary to address a scientific problem by exploiting biological
software and datasets and creating simple bioinformatics tools
• Will have demonstrated an ability to identify and access relevant
scientific literature and draw from it in a meaningful and critical
manner
