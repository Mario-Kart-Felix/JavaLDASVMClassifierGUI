The missing memristor found
Dmitri B. Strukov1, Gregory S. Snider1, Duncan R. Stewart1 & R. Stanley Williams1
Anyone who ever took an electronics laboratory class will be fami-
liar with the fundamental passive circuit elements: the resistor, the
capacitor and the inductor. However, in 1971 Leon Chua reasoned
from symmetry arguments that there should be a fourth fun-
damental element, which he called a memristor (short for memory
resistor)1. Although he showed that such an element has many
interesting and valuable circuit properties, until now no one has
presented either a useful physical model or an example of a mem-
ristor. Here we show, using a simple analytical example, that mem-
ristance arises naturally in nanoscale systems in which solid-state
electronic and ionic transport are coupled under an external bias
voltage. These results serve as the foundation for understanding a
wide range of hysteretic current–voltage behaviour observed in
many nanoscale electronic devices2–19 that involve the motion of
charged atomic or molecular species, in particular certain tita-
nium dioxide cross-point switches20–22.
More specifically, Chua noted that there are six different math-
ematical relations connecting pairs of the four fundamental circuit
variables: electric current i, voltage v, charge q and magnetic flux Q.
One of these relations (the charge is the time integral of the current)
is determined from the definitions of two of the variables, and
another (the flux is the time integral of the electromotive force, or
voltage) is determined from Faraday’s law of induction. Thus, there
should be four basic circuit elements described by the remaining
relations between the variables (Fig. 1). The ‘missing’ element—the
memristor, with memristance M—provides a functional relation
between charge and flux, dQ 5 Mdq.
In the case of linear elements, in which M is a constant, memri-
stance is identical to resistance and, thus, is of no special interest.
However, if M is itself a function of q, yielding a nonlinear circuit
element, then the situation is more interesting. The i–v characteristic
of such a nonlinear relation between q and Q for a sinusoidal input
is generally a frequency-dependent Lissajous figure1, and no com-
bination of nonlinear resistive, capacitive and inductive components
can duplicate the circuit properties of a nonlinear memristor
(although including active circuit elements such as amplifiers can
do so)1. Because most valuable circuit functions are attributable to
nonlinear device characteristics, memristors compatible with inte-
grated circuits could provide new circuit functions such as electronic
resistance switching at extremely high two-terminal device densities.
However, until now there has not been a material realization of a
memristor.
The most basic mathematical definition of a current-controlled
memristor for circuit analysis is the differential form
v~R(w)i ð1Þ
dw
dt
~i ð2Þ
where w is the state variable of the device and R is a generalized
resistance that depends upon the internal state of the device. In this
case the state variable is just the charge, but no one has been able to
propose a physical model that satisfies these simple equations. In
1976 Chua and Kang generalized the memristor concept to a much
broader class of nonlinear dynamical systems they called memristive
systems23, described by the equations
v~R(w,i)i ð3Þ
dw
dt
~f (w,i) ð4Þ
where w can be a set of state variables and R and f can in general be
explicit functions of time. Here, for simplicity, we restrict the discus-
sion to current-controlled, time-invariant, one-port devices. Note
that, unlike in a memristor, the flux in memristive systems is no
longer uniquely defined by the charge. However, equation (3) does
serve to distinguish a memristive system from an arbitrary dynamical
device; no current flows through the memristive system when the
voltage drop across it is zero. Chua and Kang showed that the i–v
characteristics of some devices and systems, notably thermistors,
Josephson junctions, neon bulbs and even the Hodgkin–Huxley
model of the neuron, can be modelled using memristive equations23.
Nevertheless, there was no direct connection between the mathe-
matics and the physical properties of any practical system, and
hence, almost forty years later, the concepts have not been widely
adopted.
Here we present a physical model of a two-terminal electrical
device that behaves like a perfect memristor for a certain restricted

a more general class of dynamical devices, memristive systems. Note that R,
C, L and M can be functions of the independent variable in their defining
equations, yielding nonlinear elements. For example, a charge-controlled
memristor is defined by a single-valued function M(q).

range of the state variable w and as a memristive system for another,
wider (but still bounded), range of w. This intuitive model produces
rich hysteretic behaviour controlled by the intrinsic nonlinearity of
M and the boundary conditions on the state variable w. The results
provide a simplified explanation for reports of current–voltage
anomalies, including switching and hysteretic conductance, multiple
conductance states and apparent negative differential resistance,
especially in thin-film, two-terminal nanoscale devices, that have
been appearing in the literature for nearly 50 years2–4.
Electrical switching in thin-film devices has recently attracted
renewed attention, because such a technology may enable functional
scaling of logic and memory circuits well beyond the limits of com-
plementary metal–oxide–semiconductors24,25. The microscopic
nature of resistance switching and charge transport in such devices
is still under debate, but one proposal is that the hysteresis
requires some sort of atomic rearrangement that modulates the
electronic current. On the basis of this proposition, we consider a
thin semiconductor film of thickness D sandwiched between two
metal contacts, as shown in Fig. 2a. The total resistance of the
device is determined by two variable resistors connected in series
(Fig. 2a), where the resistances are given for the full length D of
the device. Specifically, the semiconductor film has a region with a
high concentration of dopants (in this example assumed to be pos-
itive ions) having low resistance RON, and the remainder has a low
(essentially zero) dopant concentration and much higher resistance
ROFF.
The application of an external bias v(t) across the device will move
the boundary between the two regions by causing the charged
dopants to drift26. For the simplest case of ohmic electronic conduc-
tion and linear ionic drift in a uniform field with average ion mobility
mV, we obtain

i(t) ð6Þ
which yields the following formula for w(t):
w(t)~mV
RON

q(t) ð7Þ
By inserting equation (7) into equation (5) we obtain the memri-
stance of this system, which for RON=ROFF simplifies to:
M(q)~ROFF 1{

q(t)
 
The q-dependent term in parentheses on the right-hand side of this
equation is the crucial contribution to the memristance, and it
becomes larger in absolute value for higher dopant mobilities mV
and smaller semiconductor film thicknesses D. For any material, this
term is 1,000,000 times larger in absolute value at the nanometre scale
than it is at the micrometre scale, because of the factor of 1/D2, and
the memristance is correspondingly more significant. Thus, memri-
stance becomes more important for understanding the electronic
characteristics of any device as the critical dimensions shrink to the
nanometre scale.
The coupled equations of motion for the charged dopants and the
electrons in this system take the normal form for a current-controlled
(or charge-controlled) memristor (equations (1) and (2)). The

Figure 2 | The coupled variable-resistor model for a memristor. a, Diagram
with a simplified equivalent circuit. V, voltmeter; A, ammeter. b, c, The
applied voltage (blue) and resulting current (green) as a function of time t for
a typical memristor. In b the applied voltage is v0sin(v0t) and the resistance
ratio is ROFF=RON~160, and in c the applied voltage is 6v0sin2(v0t) and
ROFF=RON~380, where v0 is the magnitude of the applied voltage and v0 is
the frequency. The numbers 1–6 label successive waves in the applied voltage
and the corresponding loops in the i–v curves. In each plot the axes are
dimensionless, with voltage, current, time, flux and charge expressed in units
of v0 5 1 V, i0:v0=RON~10 mA, t0 ; 2p/v0 ; D2/mVv0 5 10 ms, v0t0 and
i0t0, respectively. Here i0 denotes the maximum possible current through the
device, and t0 is the shortest time required for linear drift of dopants across
the full device length in a uniform field v0/D, for example with D 5 10 nm
and mV 5 10
210 cm2 s21 V21. We note that, for the parameters chosen, the
applied bias never forces either of the two resistive regions to collapse; for
example, w/D does not approach zero or one (shown with dashed lines in the
middle plots in b and c). Also, the dashed i–v plot in b demonstrates the
hysteresis collapse observed with a tenfold increase in sweep frequency. The
insets in the i–v plots in b and c show that for these examples the charge is a
single-valued function of the flux, as it must be in a memristor.

mechanism of memristance is one possible reason why the phenom-
enon has been hidden for so long; those interested in memristive
devices were searching in the wrong places. The mathematics simply
require there to be a nonlinear relationship between the integrals of
the current and voltage, which is realized in equations (5) and (6).
Another significant issue that was not anticipated by Chua is that the
state variable w, which in this case specifies the distribution of
dopants in the device, is bounded between zero and D. The state
variable is proportional to the charge q that passes through the
device until its value approaches D; this is the condition of ‘hard’
switching (large voltage excursions or long times under bias). As long
as the system remains in the memristor regime, any symmetrical
alternating-current voltage bias results in double-loop i–v hysteresis
that collapses to a straight line for high frequencies (Fig. 2b). Multiple
continuous states will also be obtained if there is any sort of asym-
metry in the applied bias (Fig. 2c).
Obviously, equation (7) is only valid for values of w in the interval
[0, D]. Different hard-switching cases are defined by imposing a vari-
ety of boundary conditions, such as assuming that once the value of w
reaches either of the boundaries, it remains constant until the voltage
reverses polarity. In such a case, the device satisfies the normal equa-
tions for a current-controlled memristive system (equations (3) and
(4)). Figure 3a, b shows two qualitatively different i–v curves that are
possible for such a memristive device. In Fig. 3a, the upper boundary
is reached while the derivative of the voltage is negative, producing an
apparent or ‘dynamical’ negative differential resistance. Unlike a true
‘static’ negative differential resistance, which would be insensitive to
time and device history, such a dynamical effect is simply a result of
the charge-dependent change in the device resistance, and can be
identified by a strong dependence on the frequency of a sinusoidal
driving voltage. In another case, for example when the boundary is
reached much faster by doubling the magnitude of the applied volt-
age (Fig. 3b), the switching event is a monotonic function of current.
Even though in the hard-switching case there appears to be a clearly
defined threshold voltage for switching from the ‘off’ (high resis-
tance) state to the ‘on’ (low resistance) state, the effect is actually
dynamical. This means that any positive voltage v1 applied to the
device in the off state will eventually switch it to the on state after time
*D2ROFF=(2mVvzRON). The device will remain in the on state as
long as a positive voltage is applied, but even a small negative bias will
switch it back to the off state; this is why a current-hysteresis loop is
only observed for the positive voltage sweep in Fig. 3a, b.
In nanoscale devices, small voltages can yield enormous electric
fields, which in turn can produce significant nonlinearities in ionic
transport. Figure 3c illustrates such a case in which the right-hand
side of equation (6) is multiplied by a window function w(1 2 w)/D2,
which corresponds to nonlinear drift when w is close to zero or D. In
this case, the switching event requires a significantly larger amount of
charge (or even a threshold voltage) in order for w to approach either
boundary. Therefore, the switching is essentially binary because the
on and off states can be held much longer if the voltage does not
exceed a specific threshold. Nonlinearity can also be expected in the
electronic transport, which can be due to, for example, tunnelling at
the interfaces or high-field electron hopping. In this case, the hyster-
esis behaviour discussed above remains essentially the same but the
i–v characteristic becomes nonlinear.
The model of equations (5) and (6) exhibits many features that
have been described as bipolar switching, that is, when voltages of
opposite polarity are required for switching a device to the on state
and the off state. This type of behaviour has been experimentally
observed in various material systems: organic films5–9 that contain
charged dopants or molecules with mobile charged components;
chalcogenides4,10–12, where switching is attributed to ion migration
rather than a phase transition; and metal oxides2–4,20, notably TiO2
(refs 4, 13, 14, 21) and various perovskites4,15–19. For example, multi-
state8–14,16–18,20,21 and binary3,4,7,15,16 switching that are similar to those
modelled in Figs 2c and 3c, respectively, have been observed, with
some showing dynamical negative differential resistance. Typically,
hysteresis such as in Fig. 3c is observed for both voltage pola-
rities7,9–12,14–17,21, but observations of i–v characteristics resembling
Fig. 3a, b have also been reported8,17–20. In our own studies of TiOx
devices, i–v behaviours very similar to those in Figs 2b, 2c and 3c are
regularly observed. Figure 3d illustrates an experimental i–v char-
acteristic from a metal/oxide/metal cross-point device within which
the critical 5-nm-thick oxide film initially contained one layer of
insulating TiO2 and one layer of oxygen-poor TiO22x (refs 21, 22).
In this system, oxygen vacancies act as mobile 12-charged dopants,
which drift in the applied electric field, shifting the dividing line
between the TiO2 and TiO22x layers. The switching characteristic
observed for a particular memristive system helps classify the nature
of the boundary conditions on the state variable of the device.
The rich hysteretic i–v characteristics detected in many thin-film,
two-terminal devices can now be understood as memristive beha-
viour defined by coupled equations of motion: some for (ionized)
atomic degrees of freedom that define the internal state of the device,
and others for the electronic transport. This behaviour is increasingly
relevant as the active region in many electronic devices continues to
shrink to a width of only a few nanometres, so even a low applied
voltage corresponds to a large electric field that can cause charged
species to move. Such dopant or impurity motion through the active
region can produce dramatic changes in the device resistance.
Including memristors and memristive systems in integrated circuits
has the potential to significantly extend circuit functionality as long
as the dynamical nature of such devices is understood and properly
