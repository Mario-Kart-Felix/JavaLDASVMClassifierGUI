Module 2 
Terminology 
  Access control - ability to permit or deny the use 
of an object by a subject.  
  It provides 3 essential services: 
-  Identification and authentication (who can login) 
- Authorization (what authorized users can do) 
- Accountability (identifies what a user did) 
2 
AAA 
  Authentication 
  Authorization 
  Accountability 
Authentication 
  Validating a claimed identity of an end user or a 
device such as host, server, switch, router, etc. 
   Must be careful to understand whether a 
technology is using user, device or application 
authentication. 
2 
Authorization 
  The act of granting access rights to a user, 
groups of users, system, or program. 
- Typically this is done in conjunction with  
authentication. 
17 
Authentication and authorisation 
Authentication 
Is this really user X? 
Authorisation 
What can user X do? 
End user 
Service 
Application 
User 
Device 
Non-Repudiation 
  A property of a cryptographic system that 
prevents a sender from denying later that he or 
she sent a message or performed a certain 
action. 
Audit 
A chronological record of system activities that is 
sufficient to enable the reconstruction and 
examination of a given sequence of events 
Vulnerability 
  A weakness in security procedures, network 
design, or implementation that can be exploited 
to violate a corporate security policy 
- Software bugs 
- Configuration mistakes 
- Network design flaw 
  Exploit 
- Taking advantage of a vulnerability 
Risk 
  The possibility that a particular vulnerability will 
be exploited 
- Risk analysis: the process of identifying: 
Security risks 
Determining their impact 
And identifying areas require protection 
Threat 
  Any circumstance or event with the potential to 
cause harm to a networked system 
- Denial of service 
Attacks make computer resources (e.g., bandwidth, disk 
space, or CPU time) unavailable to its intended users 
- Unauthorised access 
Access without permission issues by a rightful owner of 
devices or networks 
-  Impersonation 
- Worms 
- Viruses 
Risk management vs. cost of 
security 
  Risk mitigation 
- The process of selecting appropriate controls to 
reduce risk to an acceptable level 
  The level of acceptable risk 
- Determined by comparing the risk of security hole 
exposure to the cost of implementing and enforcing 
the security policy 
  Assess the cost of certain losses and do not 
spend more to protect something than it is 
actually worth 
Attack sources 
  Active vs. passive 
- Active = Writing data to the network 
Common to disguise one’s address and conceal the identity 
of the traffic sender 
- Passive =  Reading data on the network 
Purpose = breach of confidentiality 
Attackers gain control of a host in the communication path 
between two victim machines 
Attackers has compromised the routing infrastructure to 
arrange the traffic pass through a compromised machine 
Attack sources 
  On-path vs. Off-path 
- On-path routers (transmitting datagrams) can read, modify, or 
remove any datagram transmitted along the path  
- Off-path hosts can transmit datagrams that appear to come 
from any hosts but cannot necessarily receive datagrams 
intended for other hosts 
If attackers want to receive data, they have to put themselves on-path 
-  How easy is it to subvert network topology? 
It is not easy thing to do but, it is not impossible 
  Insider or outsider 
- What is definition of perimeter/border? 
  Deliberate attack vs. unintentional event 
-  Configuration errors and software bugs are as harmful as a 
deliberate malicious network attack 
What are security aims? 
  Controlling data / network access 
  Preventing intrusions 
  Responding to incidences 
  Ensuring network availability 
  Protecting information in transit 
Security services 
  Authentication 
  Authorisation 
  Access control 
  Data integrity 
  Data confidentiality 
  Auditing / logging 
  DoS mitigation

ARP Spoofing 1 
- Client’s ARP Cache already poisoned 
- It will communicate directly to the fake  
- destination 
I want to connect to 
10.0.0.3. I don’t know the 
MAC address 
10.0.0.1 
AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA

I am 10.0.0.3. This is my 
MAC address 
MAC Flooding 
  Exploits the limitation of all switches – fixed 
CAM table size 
  CAM = Content Addressable memory = stores 
info on the mapping of individual MAC 
addresses to physical ports on the switch. 
Port 1 Port 2 Port 3 Port 4

00:01:23:45:67:B2 x 
00:01:23:45:67:C3 x 
00:01:23:45:67:D4 x 
VLAN Hopping 
  Attack on a network with multiple VLANs 
  Two primary methods: 
- Switch spoofing – attacker initiates a trunking switch 
- Double tagging – packet is tagged twice. 
 DHCP Attacks 
  DHCP Starvation Attack 
- Broadcasting vast number of DHCP requests with 
spoofed MAC address simultaneously. 
- DoS attack using DHCP leases 
  Rogue DHCP Server Attacks  
Attacker sends many different DHCP requests  
with many spoofed addresses. 
Server runs out of  IP addresses  
to allocate to valid users 
 DHCP Attack Types 
  Solution: enable DHCP snooping 
ip dhcp snooping (enable dhcp snooping globally) 
ip dhcp snooping vlan <vlan-id> (for specific 
vlans) 
ip dhcp snooping trust  
ip dhcp snooping limit rate <rate>

TCP Attacks 
  SYN Flood – occurs when an attacker sends 
SYN requests in succession to a target. 
  Causes a host to retain enough state for bogus 
half-connections such that there are no 
resources left to establish new legitimate 
connections. 
•  Exploits the 3-way handshake 
•  Attacker sends a series of SYN packets without replying with the 
ACK packet 
•  Finite queue size for incomplete connections

  Distance Vector Routing 
-  Announce 0 distance to all other nodes 
Blackhole traffic 
Eavesdrop 
  Link State Routing 
-  Can drop links randomly 
-  Can claim direct link to any other routers 
-  A bit harder to attack than DV 
  BGP attacks

Server Side Scripting 
  Server-side scripting – program is executed on the 
server and not on the user’s browser or plugin. 
  ASP.NET, PHP, mod_perl, CGI, Ruby, Python 
  Benefits: 
- Cross-platform 
- No plugin required on user side  
  Disadvantages: 
- Dynamic scripts create new security concern, exploiting 
code flaws 
1 
Cross-Site Scripting 
  Cross-site scripting or XSS – enables attackers 
to inject scripts into webpages viewed by other 
users. 
  Persistent XSS – more devastating 
  Non-persistent XSS – more common 
  Ex: BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) 
1 
SQL Injection 
  SQL Injection – a subset of unverified user input 
vulnerability that injects malicious code (or SQL 
query) into strings. This code is executed when 
passed on to the SQL server.

Wireless Attacks 
  WEP – first security mechanism for 802.11 
wireless networks 
  Weaknesses in this protocol were discovered by 
Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir, whose attacks 
became known as “FMS attacks” 
  Tools were developed to automate WEP 
cracking 
  Chopping attack were released to crack WEP 
more effectively and faster 
1 
Man in the Middle Attacks (Wireless) 
  Creates a fake access point and have clients 
authenticate to it instead of a legitimate one. 
  Capture traffic to see usernames, passwords, 
etc that are sent in clear text.

for encryption and decryption (public and private 
key pairs) 
-  Includes RSA, Diffie-Hellman, El Gamal 
2 
Terminology of cryptography 
  Cipher 
-  Cryptographic technique (algorithm) applying a secret transformation to 
messages 
  Plaintext / cleartext 
-  Original message or data 
  Encryption 
-  Transforming plaintext, using a secret key, so meaning is concealed 
  Ciphertext

Symmetric Key Algorithm 
  Stream ciphers – encrypts bits of the message 
at a time 
  Block ciphers – takes a block of bits and 
encrypts them as a single unit 
2 
Cryptography 
  Digital Signature – sender encrypts message 
with own private key instead of encrypting with 
intended receiver’s public key 
  Message digests – produces a condensed 
representation of a message (hashing) 
- MD5 
- SHA-1 
- HMAC 
2 
Secret Key Algorithms 
  DES – block cipher using shared key 
encryption, 56-bit 
  3DES (Triple DES) – a block cipher that applies 
DES three times to each data block 
  RC4 – variable-length key, “stream 
cipher” (generate stream from key, XOR with 
data) 
  AES – replacement for DES; current standard 
2 
DES 
  Data Encryption Standard 
  Developed by IBM for the US government in 
1973-1974, and approved in Nov 1976. 
  Based on Horst Feistel’s Lucifer cipher 
  block cipher using shared key encryption, 56-bit 
key length 
  Block size: 64 bits 
2 
Triple DES 
  3DES (Triple DES) – a block cipher that applies 
DES three times to each data block 
  Uses a key bundle comprising of three DES 
keys (K1, K2, K3), each with 56 bits excluding 
parity. 
  DES encrypts with K1, decrypts with K2, then 
encrypts with K3 
- Ci= EK1(DK2(EK1(Pi))) 
  Disadvantage: very slow

•  Many applications use K3=K1, yielding a key length of 112 bits 
•  Interoperable with conventional DES if K1=K2=K3 
AES 
•  Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Cipher  
•  Published in November 2001 
•  Symmetric block cipher 
•  Has a fixed block size of 128 bits 
•  Has a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits 
•  Based on Rijndael cipher which was developed 
by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen

Hash Functions 
A hash function takes an input message 
 of arbitrary length and outputs fixed-length 
 code. The fixed-length output is called the 
 hash, or the message digest, of the original 
 input message.  
Common Algorithms: MD-5 (128), SHA-1 (160) 
Hashing 
  Also called a digest or checksum 
  A form of signature that represents the data.  
  Uses:  
- Verifying file integrity - if the hash changes, it means 
the data is either compromised or altered in transit. 
- Digitally signing documents 
- Hashing passwords  
2 
Hashing 
  MD5 Message Digest Algorithm  
- Outputs a 128-bit fingerprint of an arbitrary-length 
input 
  SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm) 
- Outputs a 160-bit message digest similar to MD5 
- Widely-used on security applications (TLS, SSL, 
PGP, SSH, S/MIME, IPsec) 
2 
Diffie-Hellman 
  Diffie-Hellman Protocol – requires that both the 
sender and recipient of a message have key 
pairs.  
  Combining one’s private key and the other’s 
public key, both parties can compute the same 
shared secret number.

Diffie-Hellman 6 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DiffieHellman.png 
DH Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
  Diffie-Hellman is subject to a man-in-the-middle attack 
  Digital signatures of the ‘public values’ can enable each 
party to verify that the other party actually generated the 
value 
=> DH exchanges need to be  authenticated!!

Trusted Network 
  Standard defensive-oriented technologies 
- Firewall 
-  Intrusion Detection 
  Build TRUST on top of the TCP/IP infrastructure 
- Strong authentication 
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
2 
Strong Authentication 
  An absolute requirement 
  Two-factor authentication  
-  Passwords (something you know) 
-  Tokens (something you have) 
  Examples: 
-  Passwords 
-  Tokens 
-  Tickets 
-  Restricted access 
-  PINs 
-  Biometrics 
-  Certificates 
2 
Public Key Infrastructure 
Public Key Infrastructure 
  Framework that builds the network of trust 
  Combines public key cryptography, digital 
signatures, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, 
authentication, nonrepudiation, and access 
control 
  Protects applications that require high level of 
security 
2 
PKI Components 
  Certificate Authority (CA) – a trusted third party 
- Trusted by both the owner of the certificate and the 
party relying upon the certificate 
  Registration Authority (RA) – binds keys to 
users 
- Users who wish to have their own certificate 
registers with the RA 
  Validation Authority (VA) – validates the user is 
who he says he is 
Certificate Authority 
  Components: 
- Certificate Authority – a trusted third party   
Trusted by both the owner of the certificate and the party 
relying upon the certificate. 
- Validation Authority  
- Registration Authority

Digital Certificate 
  Digital certificate – basic 
element of PKI; secure 
credential that identifies 
the owner 
  Also called public key 
certificate 
2 
Digital Certificates 
  Digital certificates deal with the problem of  
-  Binding a public key to an entity 
-  A major legal issue related to eCommerce 
  A digital certificate contains: 
-  User’s public key 
-  User’s ID 
- Other information e.g. validity period 
  Certificate examples: 
-  X509 (standard) 
-  PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) 
-  Certificate Authority (CA) creates and digitally signs 
certificates 
Digital Certificates 
  To obtain a digital certificate, Alice must: 
- Make a certificate signing request to the CA 
- Alice sends to CA: 
Her identifier IdA 
Her public key KA_PUB 
Additional information 
  CA returns Alice’s digital certificate, 
cryptographically binding her identity to public 
key: 
- CertA = {IDA, KA_PUB, info, SigCA(IDA,KA_PUB,info)} 
X.509 
  An ITU-T standard for a public key infrastructure 
for single-sign-on and Privilege Management 
Infrastructure (PMI) 
  Assumes a strict hierarchical system of 
Certificate Authorities (CAs) 
  Structure of a Certificate
