A Flexible New Technique
for Camera Calibration
Zhengyou Zhang, Senior Member, IEEE
AbstractÐWe propose a flexible new technique to easily calibrate a camera. It
only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two)
different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved.
The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed
procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement
based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real
data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have
been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive
equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy
to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory
environments to real world use. The corresponding software is available from the
author's Web page.

1 MOTIVATIONS
CAMERA calibration is a necessary step in 3D computer vision in
order to extract metric information from 2D images. Much work
has been done, starting in the photogrammetry community (see [2],
[4] to cite a few), and more recently in computer vision ([9], [8],
[23], [7], [25], [24], [16], [6] to cite a few). We can classify those
techniques roughly into two categories: photogrammetric calibra-
tion and self-calibration.
. Three-dimensional reference object-based calibration.
Camera calibration is performed by observing a calibration
object whose geometry in 3D space is known with very
good precision. Calibration can be done very efficiently [5].
The calibration object usually consists of two or three
planes orthogonal to each other. Sometimes a plane
undergoing a precisely known translation is also used
[23]. These approaches require an expensive calibration
apparatus, and an elaborate setup.
. Self-calibration. Techniques in this category do not use
any calibration object. Just by moving a camera in a static
scene, the rigidity of the scene provides in general two
constraints [16], [14] on the cameras' internal parameters
from one camera displacement by using image information
alone. Therefore, if images are taken by the same camera
with fixed internal parameters, correspondences between
three images are sufficient to recover both the internal and
external parameters which allow us to reconstruct
3D structure up to a similarity [15], [12]. While this
approach is very flexible, it is not yet mature [1]. Because
there are many parameters to estimate, we cannot always
obtain reliable results.
Other techniques exist: vanishing points for orthogonal directions
[3], [13], and calibration from pure rotation [11], [20].
Our current research is focused on a desktop vision system
(DVS) since the potential for using DVSs is large. Cameras are
becoming inexpensive and ubiquitous. A DVS aims at the general
public who are not experts in computer vision. A typical computer
user will perform vision tasks only from time to time, so they will
not be willing to invest money for expensive equipment. Therefore,
flexibility, robustness, and low cost are important. The camera
calibration technique described in this paper was developed with
these considerations in mind.
The proposed technique only requires the camera to observe a
planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations.
The pattern can be printed on a laser printer and attached to a
ªreasonableº planar surface (e.g., a hard book cover). Either the
camera or the planar pattern can be moved by hand. The motion
need not be known. The proposed approach, which uses 2D metric
information, lies between the photogrammetric calibration, which
uses explicit 3D model, and self-calibration, which uses motion
rigidity or equivalently implicit 3D information. Both computer
simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed
technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared
with classical techniques, the proposed technique is considerably
more flexible: Anyone can make a calibration pattern by him/her-
self and the setup is very easy. Compared with self-calibration, it
gains a considerable degree of robustness. We believe the new
technique advances 3D computer vision one step from laboratory
environments to the real world.
Note that Triggs [22] recently developed a self-calibration
technique from at least five views of a planar scene. His technique
is more flexible than ours, but has difficulty to initialize. Liebowitz
and Zisserman [13] described a technique of metric rectification for
perspective images of planes using metric information, such as a
known angle, two equal though unknown angles, and a known
length ratio. They also mentioned that calibration of the internal
camera parameters is possible provided at least three such rectified
planes, although no experimental results were shown.
During the revision of this paper, we notice the publication of
an independent but similar work by Sturm and Maybank [21].They
use a simplified camera model (image axes are orthogonal to each
other) and have studied the degenerate configurations exhaus-
tively for the case of one and two planes, which are very important
in practice if only one or two views are used for camera calibration.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the basic
constraints from observing a single plane. Section 3 describes the
calibration procedure. We start with a closed-form solution,
followed by nonlinear optimization. Radial lens distortion is also
modeled. Section 4 provides the experimental results. Both
computer simulation and real data are used to validate the
proposed technique. In the Appendix, we provides a number of
details, including the techniques for estimating the homography
between the model plane and its image.
2 BASIC EQUATIONS
We examine the constraints on the camera's intrinsic parameters
provided by observing a single plane. We start with the notation
used in this paper.
2.1 Notation
A 2D point is denoted by m  u; vT . A 3D point is denoted by
M  X; Y ; ZT . We use ex to denote the augmented vector by adding
1 as the last element: em  u; v; 1T andfM  X; Y ; Z; 1T . A camera is
modeled by the usual pinhole: The relationship between a 3D point
M and its image projection m is given by

where s is an arbitrary scale factor, R; t, called the extrinsic
parameters is the rotation and translation which relates the world
coordinate system to the camera coordinate system, and A is called
the camera intrinsic matrix, with u0; v0 the coordinates of the
principal point,  and  the scale factors in image u and v axes, and
 the parameter describing the skew of the two image axes.
We use the abbreviation AÿT for Aÿ1T or AT ÿ1.
2.2 Homography between the Model Plane and Its Image
Without loss of generality, we assume the model plane is on Z  0
of the world coordinate system. Let's denote the ith column of the
rotation matrix R by ri. From (1), we have
s
u
v
1
24 35  A r1 r2 r3 t 
X
Y
0
1
2664
3775  A r1 r2 t  XY
1
24 35:
By abuse of notation, we still use M to denote a point on the model
plane, but M  X;Y T since Z is always equal to zero. In turn,fM  X; Y ; 1T . Therefore, a model point M and its image m is
related by a homography H:
s em  HfM with H  A r1 r2 t : 2
As is clear, the 3 3 matrix H is defined up to a scale factor.
2.3 Constraints on the Intrinsic Parameters
Given an image of the model plane, an homography can be
estimated (see the Appendix). Let's denote it by H  h1 h2 h3 .
From (2), we have
h1 h2 h3   A r1 r2 t ;
where  is an arbitrary scalar. Using the knowledge that r1 and r2
are orthonormal, we have
hT1 A
ÿTAÿ1h2  0 3
hT1 A
ÿTAÿ1h1  hT2 AÿTAÿ1h2: 4
These are the two basic constraints on the intrinsic parameters,
given one homography. Because a homography has 8 degrees of
freedom and there are six extrinsic parameters (three for rotation
and three for translation), we can only obtain two constraints on
the intrinsic parameters. Note that AÿTAÿ1 actually describes the
image of the absolute conic [15]. In the next section, we will give a
geometric interpretation.
2.4 Geometric Interpretation
We are now relating (3) and (4) to the absolute conic [16], [15].
It is not difficult to verify that the model plane, under our
convention, is described in the camera coordinate system by the
following equation:
r3
rT3 t
 T x
y
z
w
2664
3775  0;
where w  0 for points at infinity and w  1 otherwise. This plane
intersects the plane at infinity at a line and we can easily see that
r1
0
 
and
r2
0
 
are two particular points on that line. Any point on it is a linear
combination of these two points, i.e.,
x1  a r10
 
 b r2
0
 
 ar1  br2
0
 
:
Now, let's compute the intersection of the above line with the
absolute conic. By definition, the point x1, known as the circular
point [18], satisfies: xT1x1  0, i.e., ar1  br2T ar1  br2  0, or
a2  b2  0. The solution is b  ai, where i2  ÿ1. That is, the two
intersection points are
x1  a r1  ir20
 
:
The significance of this pair of complex conjugate points lies in the
fact that they are invariant to Euclidean transformations. Their
projection in the image plane is given, up to a scale factor, by
em1  Ar1  ir2  h1  ih2:
Point em1 is on the image of the absolute conic, described by
AÿTAÿ1 [15]. This gives
h1  ih2TAÿTAÿ1h1  ih2  0:
Requiring that both real and imaginary parts be zero yields (3)
and (4).
3 SOLVING CAMERA CALIBRATION
This section provides the details how to effectively solve the
camera calibration problem. We start with an analytical solution,
followed by a nonlinear optimization technique based on the
maximum-likelihood criterion. Finally, we take into account lens
distortion, giving both analytical and nonlinear solutions.

Note that B is symmetric, defined by a 6D vector

Therefore, the two fundamental constraints (3) and (4), from a
given homography, can be rewritten as two homogeneous
equations in b:
vT12

b  0: 8
IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 22, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2000 1331
If n images of the model plane are observed, by stacking n such
equations as (8), we have
Vb  0; 9
where V is a 2n 6 matrix. If n  3, we will have in general a
unique solution b defined up to a scale factor. If n  2, we can
impose the skewless constraint   0, i.e., 0; 1; 0; 0; 0; 0b  0,
which is added as an additional equation to (9). (If n  1, we can
only solve two camera intrinsic parameters, e.g.,  and , assuming
u0 and v0 are known (e.g., at the image center) and   0, and that
is indeed what we did in [19] for head pose determination based
on the fact that eyes and mouth are reasonably coplanar. In fact,
Tsai [23] already mentions that focal length from one plane is
possible, but incorrectly says that aspect ratio is not.) The solution
to (9) is well-known as the eigenvector of VTV associated with the
smallest eigenvalue (equivalently, the right singular vector of V
associated with the smallest singular value).
Once b is estimated, we can compute all camera intrinsic
parameters as follows. The matrix B, as described in Section 3.1, is
estimated up to a scale factor, i.e., B  AÿTA with  an arbitrary
scale. Without difficulty, we can uniquely extract the intrinsic
parameters from matrix B.

Once A is known, the extrinsic parameters for each image is
readily computed. From (2), we have
r1  Aÿ1h1; r2  Aÿ1h2; r3  r1  r2; t  Aÿ1h3
with   1=kAÿ1h1k  1=kAÿ1h2k. Of course, because of noise in
data, the so-computed matrix R  r1; r2; r3 does not, in general,
satisfy the properties of a rotation matrix. The best rotation matrix
can then be obtained through for example singular value
decomposition [10], [26].
3.2 Maximum-Likelihood Estimation
The above solution is obtained through minimizing an algebraic
distance which is not physically meaningful. We can refine it
through maximum-likelihood inference.
We are givenn images of a model plane and there arempoints on
the model plane. Assume that the image points are corrupted by
independent and identically distributed noise. The maximum-
likelihood estimate can be obtained by minimizing the following
functional:
Xn
i1
Xm
j1
kmij ÿ m̂A;Ri; ti;Mjk2; 10
where m̂A;Ri; ti;Mj is the projection of point Mj in image i,
according to (2). A rotation R is parameterized by a vector of three
parameters, denoted by r, which is parallel to the rotation axis and
whose magnitude is equal to the rotation angle. R and r are related
by the Rodrigues formula [5]. Minimizing (10) is a nonlinear
minimization problem, which is solved with the Levenberg-
Marquardt Algorithm as implemented in Minpack [17]. It requires
an initial guess of A; fRi; tiji  1::ng which can be obtained using
the technique described in the previous section.
Desktop cameras usually have visible lens distortion, especially
the radial components. We have included these while minimizing
(10). Refer to the technical report, [26], for more details.
3.3 Summary
The recommended calibration procedure is as follows:
1. Print a pattern and attach it to a planar surface.
2. Take a few images of the model plane under different
orientations by moving either the plane or the camera.
3. Detect the feature points in the images.
4. Estimate the five intrinsic parameters and all the extrinsic
parameters using the closed-form solution, as described in
Section 3.1
5. Refine all parameters, including lens distortion para-
meters, by minimizing (10).
There is a degenerate configuration in my technique when
planes are parallel to each other. Refer to the technical report, [26],
for a more detailed description.
4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed algorithm has been tested on both computer
simulated data and real data. The closed-form solution involves
finding a singular value decomposition of a small 2n 6 matrix,
where n is the number of images. The nonlinear refinement
within the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm takes 3 to 5 iterations
to converge. Due to space limitation, we describe in this section
one set of experiments with real data when the calibration
pattern is at different distances from the camera. The reader is
referred to [26] for more experimental results with both computer
simulated and real data, and to the following Web page: http://
research.microsoft.com/~zhang/Calib/ for some experimental
data and the software.
The example is shown in Fig. 1. The camera to be calibrated is
an off-the-shelf PULNiX CCD camera with 6 mm lens. The image
resolution is 640 480. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the model plane
contains 9 9 squares with nine special dots which are used to
identify automatically the correspondence between reference
points on the model plane and square corners in images. It was
printed on a A4 paper with a 600 DPI laser printer and attached to
a cardboard.
In total, 10 images of the plane were taken (six of them are shown
in Fig. 1). Five of them (called Set A) were taken at close range, while
the other five (called Set B) were taken at a larger distance. We
applied our calibration algorithm to Set A, Set B, and also to the
whole set (called Set A+B). The results are shown in Table 1. For
intuitive understanding, we show the estimated angle between the
image axes, #, instead of the skew factor . We can see that the angle
# is very close to 90, as expected with almost all modern
CCD cameras. The cameras parameters were estimated consistently
for all three sets of images, except the distortion parameters with Set
B. The reason is that the calibration pattern only occupies the central
part of the image in Set B, where lens distortion is not significant
and therefore cannot be estimated reliably.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have developed a flexible new technique to easily
calibrate a camera. The technique only requires the camera to
observe a planar pattern from a few different orientations.
Although the minimum number of orientations is two if pixels
are square, we recommend four or five different orientations for
better quality. We can move either the camera or the planar
1332 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 22, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2000
pattern. The motion does not need to be known, but should not be
a pure translation. When the number of orientations is only two,
one should avoid positioning the planar pattern parallel to the
image plane. The pattern could be anything, as long as we know
the metric on the plane. For example, we can print a pattern with a
laser printer and attach the paper to a reasonable planar surface
such as a hard book cover. We can even use a book with known
size because the four corners are enough to estimate the plane
homographies.
Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure
consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear
refinement based on a maximum-likelihood criterion. Both compu-
ter simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed
technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared
with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as
two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique gains
considerable flexibility.
APPENDIX
ESTIMATING HOMOGRAPHY BETWEEN THE
MODEL PLANE AND ITS IMAGE
There are many ways to estimate the homography between the
model plane and its image. Here, we present a technique based on
a maximum-likelihood criterion. Let Mi and mi be the model and
image points, respectively. Ideally, they should satisfy (2). In
practice, they don't because of noise in the extracted image points.
Let's assume that mi is corrupted by Gaussian noise with mean 0
and covariance matrix mi . Then, the maximum-likelihood
estimation of H is obtained by minimizing the following functional

When we are given n points, we have n above equations, which
can be written in matrix equation as Lx  0, where L is a 2n 9
matrix. As x is defined up to a scale factor, the solution is well-
known to be the right singular vector of L associated with the
smallest singular value (or equivalently, the eigenvector of LTL
associated with the smallest eigenvalue). In L, some elements are
constant 1, some are in pixels, some are in world coordinates, and
some are multiplication of both. This makes L poorly conditioned
numerically. Much better results can be obtained by performing a
simple data normalization prior to running the above procedure.
