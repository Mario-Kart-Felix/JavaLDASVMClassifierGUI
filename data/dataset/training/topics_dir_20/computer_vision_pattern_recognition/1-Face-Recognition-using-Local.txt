Abstract - The face of a human being conveys a lot of information about identity and emotional state of the 
person. Face recognition is an interesting and challenging problem, and impacts important applications in 
many areas such as identification for law enforcement, authentication for banking and security system access, 
and personal identification among others. In our research work mainly consists of three parts, namely face 
representation, feature extraction and classification. Face representation represents how to model a face and 
determines the successive algorithms of detection and recognition. The most useful and unique features of the 
face image are extracted in the feature extraction phase. In the classification the face image is compared with 
the images from the database. In our research work, we empirically evaluate face recognition which considers 
both shape and texture information to represent face images based on Local Binary Patterns for person-
independent face recognition. The face area is first divided into small regions from which Local Binary Patterns 
(LBP), histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single feature vector. This feature vector forms an 
efficient representation of the face and is used to measure similarities between images.

images. Facial expression is one of the most powerful, 
natural and immediate means for human beings to 
communicate their emotions and intensions. Face 
recognition is an interesting and challenging problem, 
and impacts important applications in many areas such 
as identification for law enforcement, authentication for 
banking and security system access, and also personal 
identification among others [1]. The face plays a major 
role in our social intercourse in conveying identity and 
emotion. The human ability to recognize faces is 
remarkable. Modern Civilization heavily depends on 
person authentication for several purposes. Face 
recognition has always a major focus of research 
because of its noninvasive nature and because it is 
peoples primary method of person identification. 
II. The Paradigm of the Face 
Recognition 
Despite of the fact that at this moment already 
numerous of commercial face recognition systems are 
in use, this way of identification continues to be an 
interesting topic for researchers. This is due to the fact 
that the current systems perform well under relatively 
simple and controlled environments, but perform much 
worse when variations in different factors are present, 
such as pose, viewpoint, facial expressions, time (when 
the pictures are made) and illumination (lightening 
changes)[8]. The goal in this research area is to 
minimize the influence of these factors and create 
robust face recognition system. A model for face 
recognition is shown in Figure-1.1.  
 
 
The process of person identification by using 
face recognition can be split into three main phases 
(figure 1.1). These are face representation, feature

extraction and classification [6]. Face representation is 
the first task, that is, how to model a face. The way to 
represent a face determines the successive algorithms 
of detection and identification. For the entry-level 
recognition (that is, to determine whether or not the 
given image represents a face), the image is 
transformed (scaled and rotated) till it has the same 
‘position’ as the images from the database. In the 
feature extraction phase, the most useful and unique 
features (properties) of the face image are extracted. 
With these obtained features, the face image is 
compared with the images from the database. This is 
done in the classification phase [7, 9]. The output of the 
classification part is the identity of a face image from the 
database with the highest matching score, thus with the 
smallest differences compared to the input face image. 
Also a threshold value can be used to determine if the 
differences are small enough. After all, it could be that a 
certain face is not in the database at all. 
III. Local Binary Patterns 
There exist several methods for extracting the 
most useful features from (preprocessed) face images 
to perform face recognition. One of these feature 
extraction methods is the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) 
method. This relative new approach was introduced in 
1996 by Ojala et al. [5]. With LBP it is possible to 
describe the texture and shape of a digital image. This is 
done by dividing an image into several small regions 
from which the features are extracted (figure 1.2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. Principles of Local Binary Patterns 
The original LBP operator was introduced by 
Ojala et al. [15]. This operator works with the eight 
neighbors of a pixel, using the value of this center pixel 
as a threshold. If a neighbor pixel has a higher gray 
value than the center pixel (or the the same gray value) 
than a one is assigned to that pixel, else it gets a zero. 
The LBP code for the center pixel is then produced by 
concatenating the eight ones or zeros to a binary code 
(figure 1.3). 
 
Figure 1.3 : The Original LBP Operator 
Later the LBP operator was extended to use 
neighborhoods of different sizes. In this case a circle is 
made with radius R from the center pixel. P sampling 
points on the edge of this circle are taken and 
compared with the value of the center pixel. To get the 
values of all sampling points in the neighborhood for 
any radius and any number of pixels, (bilinear) 
interpolation is necessary. For neighborhoods the 
notation (P, R) is used. Figure 1.4 illustrates three 
neighbor-sets for different values of P and R. 
 
Figure 1.4 : Circularly neighbor-sets for three different 
values of P and R 
If the coordinates of the center pixel are (xc, yc) 
then the coordinates of his P neighbors (xp, yp) on the 
edge of the circle with radius R can be calculated with 
the sinus and cosines: 
xp = xc + Rcos(2𝜋𝜋p/P ) (1) 
yp = yc + Rsin(2𝜋𝜋p/P )  (2) 
If the gray value of the center pixel is gc and the 
gray values of his neighbors are gp, with p = 0, ..., P − 
1, than the texture T in the local neighborhood of pixel 
(xc, yc) can be defined as:

Face Recognition using Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Figure 1.2 : A preprocessed image divided into 64 
regions
These features consist of binary patterns that 
describe the surroundings of pixels in the regions. The 
obtained features from the regions are concatenated 
into a single feature histogram, which forms a 
representation of the image. Images can then be 
compared by measuring the similarity (distance) 
between their histograms. According to several studies 
[2, 3, 4] face recognition using the LBP method provides 
very good results, both in terms of speed and 
discrimination performance. Because of the way the 
texture and shape of images is described, the method 
seems to be quite robust against face images with 
different facial expressions, different lightening 
conditions, image rotation and aging of persons.
T = t(gc, g0, . . . , gP ) (3) 
Once these values of the points are obtained is 
it also possible do describe the texture in another way. 
This is done by subtracting the value of the center pixel 
from the values of the points on the circle. On this way 
the local texture is represented as a joint distribution of 
the value of the center pixel and the differences: 
T = t(gc, g0 c, . . . , gP  c) (4) 
Since t(gc) describes the overall luminance of 
an image, which is unrelated to the local image texture, 
it does not provide useful information for texture 
analysis. Therefore, much of the information about the 
textural characteristics in the original joint distribution 
(Eq. 3) is preserved in the joint difference distribution 
(Ojala et al. 2001): 
T (g0 c, . . . , gP  c) (5) 
Although invariant against gray scale shifts, the 
differences are affected by scaling. To achieve 
invariance with respect to any monotonic transformation 
of the gray scale, only the signs of the differences are 
considered. This means that in the case a point on the 
circle has a higher gray value than the center pixel (or 
the same value), a one is assigned to that point, and 
else it gets a zero: 
T  (s(g0 c), . . . , s(gP  gc) (6) 
Where      
 
In the last step to produce the LBP for pixel    
(xc, yc) a binomial weight 2p is assigned to each sign 
s(gp − gc). These binomial weights are summed: 
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿.𝑅𝑅(𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐 ,𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐) = ∑ 𝑠𝑠(
𝑝𝑝−1
𝑝𝑝=0 𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑝 − 𝑔𝑔𝑐𝑐)2𝑝𝑝  (7) 
The Local Binary Pattern characterizes the local 
image texture around (xc, yc). The original LBP operator 
in figure 1.3 is very similar to this operator with P = 8 
and R = 1, thus LBP8,1. The main difference between 
these operators is that in LBP8,1 the pixels first need to 
be interpolated to get the values of the points on the 
circle. 
V. Uniform of Local Binary Patterns 
A Local Binary Pattern is called uniform if it 
contains at most two bitwise transitions from 0 to 1 or 
vice versa. In a matter of fact this means that a uniform 
pattern has no transitions or two transitions. Only one 
transition is not possible, since the binary string needs 
to be considered circular. The two patterns with zero 
transitions, with for example eight bits, are 00000000 
and 11111111. Examples of uniform patterns with eight 
bits and two transitions are 00011100 and 11100001. 
For patterns with two transitions are P(P −1) 
combinations possible. For uniform patterns with P 
sampling points and radius R the notion 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑅𝑅𝑢𝑢2  is used. 
 
Figure 1.5 : Different texture primitives detected by the 
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑅𝑅𝑢𝑢2  
Using only uniform Local Binary Patterns has 
two important benefits. The first one is that it saves 
memory. With non-uniform patterns there are 2P possible 
combinations. With 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑅𝑅𝑢𝑢2   there are P (P − 1) + 2 
patterns possible. The number of possible patterns for a 
neighborhood of 16 (interpolated) pixels is 65536 for 
standard LBP and 242 for LBPu2. The second benefit is 
that LBPu2 detects only the important local textures, like 
spots, line ends, edges and corners. See figure 1.5 for 
examples of these texture primitives. 
VI. Face Recognition using Local 
Binary Patterns 
We explained how the LBP-method can be 
applied on images (of faces) to extract features which 
can be used to get a measure for the similarity between 
these images. The main idea is that for every pixel of an 
image the LBP-code is calculated. The occurrence of 
each possible pattern in the image is kept up. The 
histogram of these patterns, also called labels, forms a 
feature vector, and is thus a representation for the 
texture of the image. These histograms can then be 
used to measure the similarity between the images, by 
calculating the distance between the histograms.

operator. It occurs that the 
image with only pixels with uniform patterns still contains 
a considerable amount of pixels, namely 99 % of the

Face Recognition using Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
original image. So, 99% of the pixels of the image have 
uniform patterns (with LBP
 
this is even 99 %). Another 
striking thing is the fact that, by taking only the pixels 
with uniform patterns, the background is also preserved. 
This is because the background pixels all have the same 
color (same gray value) and thus their patterns contain 
zero transitions. It also seems that much of the pixels 
around the mouth, the noise and the eyes (especially 
the eyebrows) have uniform patterns.
 
VII.
 
Feature Vectors
 
Once the Local Binary Pattern for every pixel is 
calculated, the feature vector of the image can be 
constructed [10]. For an efficient representation of the 
face, first the image is divided into K2
 
regions. In figure 
1.7 a face image is divided into 82
 
= 64 regions. For 
every region a histogram with all possible labels is 
constructed. This means that every bin in a histogram 
represents a pattern and contains the number of its 
appearance in the region. The feature vector is then 
constructed by concatenating the regional histograms to 
one big histogram.
 
 
  
 
For every region all non-uniform patterns (more 
than two transitions) are labeled with one single label. 
This means that every regional histogram consists of P 
(P − 1) + 3 bins: P (P − 1) bins for the patterns with two 
transitions, two bins for the patterns with zero transitions 
and one bin for all non-uniform patterns. The total 
feature vector for an image contains K2 (P (P − 1) + 3) 
bins. So, for an image divided into 64 regions and eight 
sampling points on the circles. The LBP code cannot be 
calculated for the pixels in the area with a distance R 
from the edges of the image. This means that, in 
constructing the feature vector, a small area on the 
borders of the image is not used. For an N × M image 
the feature vector is constructed by calculating the LBP 
code for every pixel (xc, yc) with xc 
 
{R + 1, . . . ,N − R} 
and yc
 
{R + 1, . . . ,M − R}. If an image is divided into 
k × k regions, then the histogram for region (kx, ky), with 
kx
  
{1, . . . , k} and  ky 
 
{1, . . . , k}, can be defined as:
 
 
Hi(Kx, Ky ) = ∑ I{LBPP,R(x,y)x,y = L(i)}, i =
1, … … … . P(P − 1) + 3  (8)
 
𝑥𝑥 ∈ �
 �𝑅𝑅 + 1, … … … … …      ,𝑁𝑁 𝐾𝐾� �                    𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 = 1
{(𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 − 1)(𝑁𝑁 𝐾𝐾⁄ } + 1, … ,𝑁𝑁 − 𝑅𝑅             𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 = 𝐾𝐾  
{(𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥 − 1)(𝑁𝑁 𝐾𝐾⁄ } + 1, … , 𝐾𝐾𝑥𝑥(𝑁𝑁 𝐾𝐾⁄ )     𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒
   
              
   ∈ �
 �𝑅𝑅 + 1, … … … … …      ,𝑀𝑀 𝐾𝐾� �                    𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 = 1

�(𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦 − 1)(𝑀𝑀 𝐾𝐾⁄ � + 1, … , 𝐾𝐾𝑦𝑦(𝑀𝑀 𝐾𝐾⁄ )      𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒
                          
                                                                             (9) 
in which L is the label of bin i and  
 
The feature vector is effectively a description of 
the face on three different levels of locality: the labels 
contain information about the patterns on a pixel-level; 
the regions, in which the different labels are summed, 
contain information on a small regional level and the 
concatenated histograms give a global description of 
the face. 
VIII. Comparing the Feature Vectors 
To compare two face images, a sample (S) and 
a model (M), the difference between the feature vectors 
has to measure. This can be done with several possible 
dissimilarity measures for histograms: 
− Histogram Intersection 
𝐷𝐷(𝑆𝑆,𝑀𝑀) = ∑ �∑ min⁡(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 ,𝑗𝑗  ,𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 ,𝑗𝑗 )
𝐿𝐿(𝐿𝐿−1)+3
𝑖𝑖=1 �
𝑘𝑘2
𝑗𝑗=1  (11) 
− Log-likelihood Statistic 
𝐿𝐿(𝑆𝑆,𝑀𝑀) = ∑ �−∑ 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 ,𝑗𝑗  𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑔𝑔 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 ,𝑗𝑗
𝐿𝐿(𝐿𝐿−1)+3
𝑖𝑖=1 �
𝑘𝑘2
𝑗𝑗=1  (12) 
− Chi square statistic (x2) 
 
In these equations Si,j and Mi,j are the sizes of 
bin i from region j (number of appearance of pattern L(i) 
in region j). Because some regions of the face images 
(for example the regions with the eyes) could contain 
more useful information than others, a weight can be set 
for each region based on the importance of the 
information it contains. According to article [31] the  x2 
performs slightly better than histogram intersection and 
the log-likelihood statistic. By applying a weight wj to 
region j, the equation for the weighted x2 becomes: 
 
 
 
This weighted x2 for two (face) images, which is 
calculated from the histograms, is a measure for the 
similarity between these images. The lower the value of

Figure 1.7 : Face image divided into 64 regions, with for 
every region a histogram
the x2 (which is also called the‘distance’ between the 
two images), the bigger the similarity. 
IX. Implementation 
Face recognition is not a simple problem since 
an unknown face image seen in the extraction phase is 
usually different from the face image seen in the 
classification phase. Although local binary features has 
been extracted from the face image for face recognition 
that there are several face image uses in the database 
that compared with the input face image. The face 
image depends on viewing lighting and environmental 
conditions. In addition the face image changes 
according to the expressions. In the research work, 
which is flexible and efficient, should be solved the 
problems. 
X. Face Recognition Algorithm 
To implement the face recognition in this 
research work, we proposed the Local Binary patterns 
methodology. Local Binary Pattern works on local 
features that uses LBP operator which summarizes the 
local special structure of a face image [11]. 
LBP is defined as an orders set of binary 
comparisons of pixels intensities between the center 
pixels and its eight surrounding pixels. Local Binary 
Pattern do this comparison by applying the following 
formula: 
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿(𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐 ,𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐) = ∑ 𝑠𝑠(𝑖𝑖𝑛𝑛 − 𝑖𝑖𝑐𝑐)2𝑛𝑛7𝑛𝑛=0     (15) 
Where ic corresponds to the value of the center 
pixel (𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐 ,𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐), in to the value of eight surrounding pixels. 
It is used to determine the local features in the face and 
also works by using basic LBP operator. Feature 
extracted matrix originally of size 3 x 3, the values are 
compared by the value of the centre pixel, then binary 
pattern code is produced and also LBP code is 
obtained by converting the binary code into decimal 
one. 
The Face Recognition Algorithm 
Input: Training Image set. 
Output: Feature extracted from face image and

1. Initialize temp = 0 
2. FOR each image I in the training image set 
3. Initialize the pattern histogram, H = 0 
4. FOR each center pixel tc  I 
5. Compute the pattern label of tc, LBP(1) 
6. Increase the corresponding bin by 1. 
7. END FOR 
8. Find the highest LBP feature for each face image 
and combined into single vector. 
9. Compare with test face image. 
10. If it match it most similar face in database then

Results and Discussion
 This implementation is used to test the 
performance of the LBP-method on different kind of face 
images. Several parameters, like the LBP operator 
       
(P and R), non-weighted or weighted regions and the 
dividing of the regions, are varied to see the influence of 
these parameters on the performance.
 
For this 
experiment we have collected lots of face images, some 
of them are collected from photographs taken with a 
Canon Power shot A610 camera and some are taken 
from A4Tech webcams. And also collected face images

Face Recognition using Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Figure 1.7 : Flow Diagram of the Whole System
from the face database [14]. In the proposed algorithm, 
different types of face images have been recognized. 
Based on algorithm, the face image of an unknown 
identity is compared with face images of known 
individuals from a large database. In the figure 1.8 we 
can see the input facial images used for input for face 
recognition are given below:
 
 
  
And also in the figure 1.9 we can see the facial 
images that are stored in the database which compared 
with the input facial images. If the input face images are 
found or the more similarities face images are matched 
in the database then we say the face image is 
successfully recognized.
 
 
Figure 1.9 :
 
Facial Image from the Database
 
In the experiment we can train the face images 
in the database. That the facial images are successfully 
trained shown in the window mode in the bellow:
 
 
Based on the algorithm the input face images 
are compared with database facial images for 
identification. The face recognition results are shown in 
below in window mode:
 
 
The following table shows overall face recognition rate:
 
 
Table 1
 
:
 
Recognition rate of the Research
 
In the table 1 the recognition rate is above 
100%. We recognize the face images from the database 
face images by comparing between input face image 
and database image. From the experimental result, it is 
seen that the research satisfies all the requirements to 
recognize the face images.

Conclusion and Future
 
Improvements
 
a)
 
Conclusion
 
In this research has been done to the 
performance of a face recognition system by making 
use of feature extraction with Local Binary Patterns [12]. 
It mainly consists of three parts, namely face 
representation, feature extraction and classification. 
Face representation represents how to model a face 
and determines the successive algorithms of detection 
and recognition. The most useful and unique features of 
the face image are extracted in the feature extraction 
phase. In the classification the face image is compared 
with the images from the database. This method 
represents the local feature of the face and matches it 
with the most similar face image in
 
database. The 
accuracy of the system is above 100% by the Local 
Binary Patterns algorithm.
 
b)
 
Future Improvements
 
It is obvious that the result of this face 
recognition system is good but there is scope for future 
improvement. Due to time constraints we were
 
not able 
to implement some objectives that should have made 
the research work a better proposition. The main 
improvement will pursue the performances, recognizes 
the real-time face recognition [13]. I would like to 
improve my code for face image recognition as well as 
clean up the code in order to improve performance.

Face Recognition using Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
Figure 1.8 : Different Input Facial Images
Many difficulties has been faced when 
recognized face images from database such as pose 
and lighting variations, expression variations, age 
variations, and facial occlusions. In future to improve the 
pose correction, quality based frame selection, aging 
correction, and mark based matching techniques can 
be combined to build a unified system for video based 
face recognition.
