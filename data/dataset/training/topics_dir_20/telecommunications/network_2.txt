Data communication: 
which types of ‘data’?
• The same types of data (information) that can be stored 
and managed on a computer can be transferred over 
computer networks to one or several other computers.
• So the networks form an important extension of the 
stand-alone computers.
• “The network is the computer”

Data communication: 
applications (Part 1)
• Hard-copy transfer (Fax)
• Online use of the processing power of a remote computer
• Online access to information sources !

»bookshop catalogues, 
»publisher’s catalogues, 
»campus-wide and community information systems, 
»(text or multimedia) databases,

Data communication: 
applications (Part 2)
• Software-downloading
• Electronic mail from a person to one or several persons
• Computer-network based interest groups 
• Online talking / chatting (IRC,...)
• Video conferencing (Cu-seeme, ...)
• Selling, shopping, buying,..
• ...
****
11
Computer network applications: 
information and communication
1-way = information transfer = almost no interaction
• publications by e-mail / Internet radio
• file transfer
• (gopher) / core WWW based on http and static html pages
• network services based on databases (input or searches)
• e-mail communication / Usenet News
• chat / telephony / video conferencing
N-way = communication = highly interactive

Computer network protocols: 
definition
• When 2 computer systems communicate via network, 
they do that by exchanging messages.
• The structure of network messages varies from network 
to network.
• Thus the message structure in a particular network is 
agreed upon a priori and is described in a set of rules, 
each defined in a protocol.

The evolving international standard 
under development at ISO 
(International Standards Organization)

An open system is one that conforms to OSI standards in 
its communications with other systems.

bits, but in small packets.
• Routing, the followed route, 
may change during communication session.

Packet switching in communications:
advantages
• Economic usage/exploitation of existing communication 
lines in the network, resulting in
»less network congestion
»higher data communication speed
»lower cost
• Less risk of interruptions due to breaks in a link of 2 
nodes = higher reliability = less vulnerable
• Possibility of error correction of individual packets
***-

Packet switching protocols:
examples
• TCP/IP in the Internet
• X-25 in OSI networks
• ...
***-
42
The X.25 data communication 
protocol
• protocol for packet switching in data network 
• an alternative to dial-up over voice telephone lines with 
modems
• available in several “flavours”:
»direct X.25 trunk connects over leased lines
»through “PAD” interfaces
»by ordinary dial-up modem  access to X.25 “ports”
Increasing 
quality
**--
43
X.25 versus phone + modem 
for data communication
Whether you use X.25 or phone plus modem depends on a 
number of factors; 
usually the determining factor is cost.
»In North America, 
using a high speed modem over a telephone line tends to 
be less expensive.
»In Europe, 
the phone system structure usually makes X.25 more cost-
effective.

Internet: 
WAP = Wireless Application Protocol 
• A public/open, global specification that empowers mobile 
users with wireless devices to easily access and interact 
with information and services instantly over the Internet.
• It allows to deliver and to access information evn when 
the full screen environment is either not available or not 
necessary.
**--
95
Internet WAP: 
problems 
• Wireless devices represent the ultimate constrained 
computing device with limited CPU, memory, and battery 
life, and with only a simple user interface.
• Wireless networks are constrained by low bandwidth, 
and unpredictable availability and stability.

Internet in schools: 
aims and applications
• Applications by the teachers.
• Applications by the students.
• + stimulates interest in information technology in general.

Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: advantages (1)
• For many people the learning materials are accessible fast 
and at low cost. 
(However, a version printed in multiple copies can be 
cheaper than a version printed by individual users.)
The updates, corrections and improvements of the course 
material are accessible faster than when print is used for 
distribution.
100*---
Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: advantages (2)
• Links to other Internet-based information sources can be 
offered in the course material, better than in a printed 
course.
• Permanent self assessment by students can work better 
than with printed course material.
101*---
Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: advantages (3)
• Communication 
students - professor - teaching assistant(s) -
administration/secretariat 
can be offered, based on an e-mail group, a Usenet 
Newsgroup or a web-based group, for each course. 
Furthermore, an archive of messages can be stored and 
can be made searchable.
In this way one can save time and costs related to travel to 
a classroom and communication is not limited to fixed 
contact hours.
102*---
Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: advantages (4)
• Multimedia 
(coloured graphics, sound, animations, video,...) 
can be integrated well in the course material.
103*---
Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: advantages (5)
• To create a better social environment for study, 
professors as well as students can make information 
about themselves available through the web for the 
students.
• Adaptive hypertext is possible, 
but more complicated to develop.
104*---
Internet-assisted 
teaching and learning: limitations
• Students should have access to a suitable computer and to 
Internet at an acceptable price.
• The contents of the computer-based course should be 
easily conveyable without personal contacts and practical 
work.
• Interactive work that requires real-time access to the 
server computer can be too expensive due to the 
telecommunication cost.

Integrated Services Digital Network : 
What is it?
• Integrated Services Digital Network = ISDN
• intended as a worldwide upgrade to digital status for the 
Public Switched Telephone Network
• 64 kbits/s up to 2 Mbits/s available 
(which is higher than with a modem)
• designed to be delivered over existing copper wires
• allows simultaneous transfer of sound, text and numbers, 
graphics (fax),...

Integrated Services Digital Network : 
applications
• backup of leased lines
• interconnection of LANs
• home-office use
• home use: telephone, fax, network access,...
• supporting existing analogue equipment if necessary

Money transfer via the networks: 
increasing importance 
• Money transfer over the Internet and public access 
networks is not secure without precautions.
• Several systems will allow secure money transfer, even for 
small amounts of money, with only small transfer costs:
“Digital cash”, “Cyberbucks”,...
***-
110
Money transfer via the networks: 
impact on services offered
• Many services and sources of information, offered free of 
charge previously, may start charging money.
• Many services and sources of information, which were 
previously not offered, because there was no good 
charging and paying mechanism available, may be 
offered at a price.

Computer-based communication: 
boom scenario
Evolution to ‘computopia’
• International, interpersonal communication increases, 
using the international computer communication 
networks.
• Information gap (between information rich and 
information poor) disappears: access from everywhere 
(even from developing countries) to internationally 
available information.
• Capitalism and repression disappear.

Data transfer rate 
between components of computer systems
**--
120
Data transfer rates: 
introduction
• The speed of delivery of information = data transfer rate.
• This is always limited by the weakest component.
• High quality graphics, audio, animation, video,…
typically require a high transfer speed.
• When a transfer system (medium, channel,…) is used 
(shared) by more than one user, the effective, practical  
transfer rate decreases of course.
