Mathematical Writing

Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts 
This report is based on a course of the same name given at Stanford University during 
autumn quarter, 1987. Here's the catalog description: 
CS 209. Mathematical Writing-Issues of technical writing and the ef­
fective presentation of mathematics and computer science. Preparation of theses, 
papers, books , and "literate" computer programs. A term paper on a topic of 
your choice; this paper may be used for credit in another course. 
The first three lectures were a "minicourse" that summarized the basics. About two 
hundred people attended those three sessions, which were devoted primarily to a discussion 
of the points in §1  of this report. An exercise (§2) and a suggested solution (§3) were also 
part of the minicourse. 
The remaining 28 lectures covered these and other issues in depth. We saw many 
examples of "before" and "after" from manuscripts in progress . We learned how to avoid 
excessive subscripts and superscripts. We discussed the documentation of algorithms, com­
puter programs, and user manuals . We considered the process of refereeing and editing. 
We studied how to make effective diagrams and tables, and how to find appropriate quota­
tions to spice up a text. Some of the material duplicated some of what would be discussed 
in writing classes offered by the English department, but the vast majority of the lectures 
were devoted to issues that are specific to mathematics and/or computer science. 
Guest lectures by Herb Wilf (University of Pennsylvania), Jeff Ullman (Stanford), 
Leslie Lamport (Digital Equipment Corporation) ,  Nils Nilsson (Stanford), Mary-Claire 
van Leunen (Digital Equipment Corporation) ,  Rosalie Stemer (San Francisco Chronicle), 
and Paul Halmos (University of Santa Clara), were a special highlight as each of these 
outstanding authors presented their own perspectives on the problems of mathematical 
communication. 
This report contains transcripts of the lectures and copies of various handouts that 
were distributed during the quarter. We think the course was able to clarify a surprisingly 
large number of issues that play an important part in the life of every professional who 
works in mathematical fields. Therefore we hope that people who were unable to attend 
the course might still benefit from it, by reading this summary of what transpired. 
The authors wish to thank Phyllis Winkler for the first-rate technical typing that 
made these notes possible. 
Caveat: These are transcripts of lectures, not a polished set of essays on the subject. 
Some of the later lectures refer to mistakes in the notes of earlier lectures; we have decided 
to correct some (but not all) of those mistakes before printing this report. References to 
such no-longer-existent blunders might be hard to understand. Understand? 
Videotapes of the class sessions are kept in the Mathematical & Computer Sciences 
Library at Stanford.

§ 1. Notes on Technical Writing 
Stanford's library card catalog refers to more than 100 books about technical writing, 
including such titles as The Art of Technical Writing, The Craft of Technical Writing, 
The Teaching of Technical Writing. There is even a journal devoted to the subject, the 
IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, published since 1958. The American 
Chemical Society, the American Institute of Physics, the American Mathematical Society, 
and the Mathematical Association of America have each published "manuals of style." 
The last of these, Wi'iting Mathematics Well by Leonard Gillman, is one of the required 
texts for CS 209. 
The nicest little reference for a quick tutorial is The Elements of Style, by Strunk and 
White (Macmillan, 1979). Everybody should read this 85-page book, which tells about 
English prose writing in general. But it isn't a required text-it's merely recommended. 
The other required text for CS 209 is A Handbook for Scholars by Mary-Claire van 
Leunen (Knopf, 1978). This well-written book is a real pleasure to read, in spite of its 
unexciting title. It tells about footnotes, references, quotations, and such things, done 
correctly instead of the old-fashioned "op. cit." way. 
Mathematical writing has certain peculiar problems that have rarely been discussed 
in the literature. Gillman's book refers to the three previous classics in the field: An 
article by Harley Flanders, Amer. Math. Monthly, 1971 ,  pp. 1-10; another by R. P. Boas 
in the same journal, 1981, pp. 727-731.  There's also a nice booklet called How t o  Write 
Mathematics, published by the American Mathematical Society in 1973, especially the 
delightful essay by Paul R. Halmos on pp. 19-48. 
The following points are especially important, in your instructor's view: 
1 .  Symbols in different formulas must be separated by words. 
Bad: Consider Sq, q < p. 
Good: Consider Sq, where q < p. 
2.  Don't start a sentence with a symbol. 
Bad: xn - a has n distinct zeroes. 
Good: The polynomial xn - a has n distinct zeroes. 
3. Don't use the symbols .' . , =*', V, 3, 3; replace them by the corresponding words. 
(Except in works on logic, of course. )  
4. The statement just preceding a theorem, algorithm, etc., should be a complete sen­
tence or should end with a colon. 
Bad: We now have the following 
T heorem. H(x) is continuous. 
This is bad on three counts, including rule 2 .  It should be rewritten, for example, like 
this: 
Good: We can now prove the following result. 
Theorem_ The function H(x) defined in (5) is continuous. 
Even better would be to replace the first sentence by a more suggestive motivation, 
tying the theorem up with the previous discussion. 
[§ 1. MINICOURSE ON TECHNICAL WRITING 1) 
5 .  The statement of a theorem should usually be  self-contained , not depending on the 
assumptions in the preceding text. (See the restatement of the theorem in point 4.) 
6. The word "we" is often useful to avoid passive voice; the "good" first sentence of 
example 4 is much better than "The following result can now be proved." But this 
use of "we" should be used in contexts where it means "you and me together", not a 
formal equivalent of "I". Think of a dialog between author and reader. 
In most technical writing, "I" should be avoided, unless the author's persona is rele­
vant. 
7. There is a definite rhythm in sentences. Read what you have written, and change the 
wording if it does not flow smoothly. For example, in the text Sorting and Searching it 
was sometimes better to say "merge patterns" and sometimes better to say "merging 
patterns". There are many ways to say "therefore" , but often only one has the correct 
rhythm. 
S. Don't omit "that" when it helps the reader to parse the sentence. 
Bad: Assume A is a group. 
Good: Assume that A. is a group. 
The words "assume" and "suppose" should usually be followed by "that" unless a.n­
other "that" appea.rs nearby. But never say "We have that x = y," say '''vVe have 
x = y." And avoid unnecessary padding "because of the fact that" unless you feel 
that the reader needs a moment to recuperate from a conceritrated sequence of ideas . 
9. Vary the sentence structure and the choice of words, to avoid monotony. But use 
parallelism when parallel concepts are being discussed. For example (Strunk and 
White #15), don't say this: 
Rather: 
Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the lab­
oratory method is employed. 
Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by 
the laboratory method . 
Avoid words like "this" or "also" in consecutive sentences; such words, as well as 
unusual or polysyllabic utterances, tend to stick in a reader's mind longer than other 
words, and good style will keep "sticky" words spaced well apart. (For example, I'd 
better not say "utterances" any more in the rest of these notes.) 
10. Don't use the style of homework papers, in which a sequence of formulas is merely 
listed. Tie the concepts together with a running commentary. 
11 .  Try to state things twice, in complementary ways, especially when giving a definition. 
This reinforces the reader's understanding. (Examples, see §2 below: Nn is defined 
twice, An is described as "nonincreasing", L( C, P) is characterized as the smallest 
subset of a certain type.) All variables must be defined, at least informally, when they 
are first introduced . 
[2 §l. MINICOURSE ON TECHNICAL WRITING) 
12. Motivate the reader for what follows. In the example of §2, Lemma 1 is motivated 
by the fact that its converse is true. Definition 1 is motivated only by decree; this is 
somewhat riskier. 
Perhaps the most important principle of good writing is to keep the reader uppermost 
in mind: What does the reader know so far? What does the reader expect next and 
why? 
When describing the work of other people it is sometimes safe to provide motivation 
by simply stating that it is "interesting" or "remarkable"; but it is best to let the 
results speak for themselves or to give reasons why the things seem interesting or 
, remarkable. 
When describing your own work, be humble and don't use superlatives of praise, either 
explicitly or implicitly, even if you are enthusiastic. 
13. Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition. There­
fore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but the simplest formulas are 
replaced by "blah" or some other grunting noise. 
14. Don't use the same notation for two different things. Conversely, use consistent nota­
tion for the same thing when it appears in several places. For example, don't say "A.j 
for 1 :5 j S n" in one place and" Ak for 1 S k S n" in another place unless there is a 
good reason. It is often useful to choose names for indices so that i varies from 1 to 
In and j from 1 to n, say, and to stick to consistent usage. Typographic conventions 
( like lowercase letters for elements of sets and uppercase for sets) are also useful. 
15. Don't get carried away by subscripts, especially when dealing with a set that doesn't 
need to be indexed; set element notation can be used to avoid subscripted subscripts. 
For example, it is often troublesome to start out with a definition like "Let X = 
{Xl,"" In}" if you're going to need subsets of X, since the subset will have to 
defined as {Xi., ... , Xim}, say. Also you'll need to be speaking of elements Xi and Xj 
all the time. Don't name the elements of X unless necessary. Then you can refer to 
elements X and y of X in your subsequent discussion, without needing subscripts; or 
YOll can refer to Xl and X2 as specified elements of X. 
16. Display important formulas on a line by themselves. If you need to refer to some of 
these formulas from remote parts of the text, give reference numbers to all of the most 
important ones, even if they aren't referenced. 
17. Sentences should be readable from left to right without ambiguity. Bad examples: 
"Smith remarked in a paper about the scarcity of data." "In the theory of rings, 
groups and other algebraic structures are treated." 
18. Small numbers should be spelled out when used as adjectives, but not when used as 
names ( i.e., when talking about numbers as numbers). 
Bad: The method requires 2 passes. 
Good: Method 2 is illustrated in Fig. 1; it requires 17 passes. The count was 
increased by 2. The leftmost 2 in the sequence was changed to a l. 
19. Capitalize names like Theorem 1, Lemma 2, Algorithm 3, Method 4. 
[§1. MfNfCOURSE ON TECHNICAL WRITING 31 
[4 
20. Some handy ma. .. "(ims: 
Watch out for prepositions that sentences end with. 
When dangling, consider your participles. 
About them sentence fragments. 
Make each pronoun agree with their antecedent. 
Don't use commas, which aren't necessary. 
Try to never split infinitives. 
21. Some words frequently misspelled by computer scientists: 
implement not impliment 
complement not compliment 
occurrence not occurence 
dependent not dependant 
auxiliary not auxiliary 
feasible not feasable 
preceding not preceeding 
referring not refering 
category not catagory 
consistent not consistant 
PL/I not PL/1 
descendant (noun) not descendent 
its (belonging to it) not it's (it is) 
The following words are no longer being hyphenated in current literature: 
nonnegative 
nonzero 
22. Don't say "which" when "that" sounds better. The general rule nowadays is to use 
"which" only when it is preced
' ed by a comma or by a preposition, or when it is used 
interrogatively. Experiment to find out which is better, "which" or "that", and you'll 
understand this rule. 
Bad: Don't use commas which aren't necessary. 
Good: Don't use commas that aren't necessary. 
Another common error is to say "less" when it should be "fewer" . 
23. In the example at the bottom of § 2 below, note that the text preceding displayed 
equations (1) and (2) does not use any special punctuation. Many people would have 
written 
of "nonincreasing" vectors: 
An = {(al, . . .  ,an) E Nn I al 2: ... 2: an}. (1) 
If G and P are subsets of Nn , let: 
L(G,P) = . . .  
and those colons are wrong. 
§l. MINICOURSE ON TECHN1CAL WR1TCNG] 
24. The opening paragraph should be your best paragraph. and its first sentence should 
be your best sentence. If a paper st3rts badly, the reader will wince and be resigned to 
a difficult job of fighting with your prose. Conversely, if the beginning flows smoothly. 
the reader will be hooked and won't notice occasional lapses in the later parts . 
Probably the worst way to start is wi th a sentence of the form "An x is y." For 
example, 
Bad: An important method for internal sorting is quicksort. 
Good: Quicksort is an important method for internal sorting, because 
Bad: A commonly used data structure is the priority queue. 
Good: Priority queues are significant components of the data structures needed 
for many different applications. 
25. The normal style rules for English say that commas and periods should be placed in­
side quotation marks, but other punctuation (like colons, semicolons, question marks, 
exclamation marks) stay outside the quotation marks unless they are part of the quo­
tation. It is generally best to go along with this illogical convention about commas 
and periods, because it is so well established, except when you are using quotation 
marks to describe some text as a specific string of symbols . For example, 
Good: Always end your program with the word "end" .  
On  the other hand, punctuation should always be strictly logical with respect to 
parentheses and brackets. Put a period inside parentheses if and only if the sentence 
ending with that period is entirely within the parentheses . The punctuation within 
parentheses should be correct, independently of the outside context, and the punctu­
ation outside the parentheses should be correct if the parenthesized statement would 
be removed. 
Bad: This is bad, (although intentionally so.) 
26. Resist the temptation to use long strings of nouns as adjectives: consider the packet 
switched data communication network protocol problem. 
In general, don't use jargon unnecessarily. Even specialists in a field get more pleasure 
from papers that use a nonspecialist's vocabulary. 
Bad: "If L +(P, No) is the set of functions f: P -+ No with the property that 
3 V p?:: no => f (p) = 0 noENo pEP 
then there exists a bijection N\ -+ L +(P, No) such that if n -+ f then 
n = II pf(p). 
pEP 
Here P is the prime numbers and N\ = No � {O}." 
[§l. MINICOURSE ON TECHNICAL WRITING 
[6  
Better: "According to the 'fundamental theorem of arithmetic' (pron'd III ex. 
1 .2.4-21), each positive integer t! can be expressed in the form 
u = 2u23u35u57u711ull . . . = II pUp� 
P prime 
where the exponents t!2, t!3,'" are uniquely determined nonnegative inte­
gers, and where all but a finite number of the exponents a.re zero." 
[The first quotation is from Carl Linderholm's neat satirical book Mathema.tics Made 
Difficult; the second is from D. Knuth's Seminumericai Algorithms, Section 4.5.2.] 
When in doubt, read The Art of Computer Programming for outstanding examples 
of good style. 
[That "as a joke. Humor is best used in technical writing when readers ca.n understand 
the joke only when they also understand a technical point that is being made. Here 
is another example from Linderholm: 
"... 0D = 0 and N0 = N, which we may express by saying that 0 is 
absorbing on the left and neutral on the right, like British toilet paper." 
Try to restrict yourself to jokes that will not seem silly on second or third reading. 
And don't overuse exclamation points!]

§2. An Exercise on Technical Writing 
In the following excerpt from a term paper, N denotes the nonnegative integers, Nn 
denotes the set of n-tuples of nonnegative integers, and An = (al,"" an) E Nn I al � 
'" � an}. If C,P C Nn, then L(C,P) is defined to be {C+PI + ... +Pm Ic E C ,  m � O. 
and Pj E P for 1 ::; j ::; m}. We want to prove that L( C, P) S;; An implies C, P S;; An. 
The following proof, directly quoted from a sophomore term paper, is mathematically 
correct (except for a minor slip) but stylistically atrocious: 
L(C,P) c A.n 
C C L � C C An 
Spse pEP, P if; An � Pi < Pj for i < j 
C + pEL C An 
.'. Ci + Pi � Cj + pj but Ci � Cj � O,Pj � Pi' (Ci - Cj) � (Pi - Pi) 
but 3 a constant k " c + kp if; An

� k -1 � k· m k,m � 1 Contradiction 
.'. P E An 
.'. L(C,P) c An � C, P C An and the 
lemma is true. 
A possible way to improve the quality of the writing: 
Let N denote the set of nonnegative integers, and let 
Nn = { (bl, ... , bn) I bi E N for 1 ::; i S n} 
be the set of n-dimensional vectors with nonnegative integer components. We shall be 
especially interested in the subset of "nonincreasing" vectors, 
(1) 
If C and P are subsets of Nn, let 
L( C, P) = {c + PI + ... + Pm Ic E C, m � 0,  and Pj E P for 1 ::; j ::; m} (2) 
be the smallest subset of Nn that contains C and is closed under the addition of elements 
of P. Since An is closed under addition, L( C, P) will be a subset of An whenever C and P 
are both contained in An. We can also prove the converse of this statement. 
Lemma 1. H L(C,P) S;; An and C =J 0, then C S;; An and P S;; An. 
Proof. (Now it's your turn to write it up beautifully.) 
[§2. AN EXERCISE ON TECHNICAL WRITING 7) 
[8 
§3. An Answer 
Here is one way to complete the exercise in the previous section. (But please try to WORI, 
IT YOURSELF BEFORE READING THIS. ) Note that a few clauses have been inserted to help 
keep the reader synchronized with the current goals a.nd subgoals and strategies of the 
proof. Furthermore the notation (h, . . . , bn) is used instead of (PI, . .. , Pn), in the second 
paragraph below, to avoid confusion with formula (2) .  
Proof. Assume that L( C, P) � An. Since C is always contained in L( C, P), we must 
have C � An; therefore only the condition P � An needs to be verified. 
If P is not contained in An, there must be a vector (bl,·  . . , bn) E P such that bi < "j 
for some i < j. 'vVe want to show that this leads to a contradiction. 
Since the set C is nonempty, it contains some element (CI, ... , cn). We know that the 
components of this vector satisfy CI � ... � Cn, because C � An. 
Now (CI, .. . , Cn) + k(bl, ... , bn) is an element of L(C,P) for all k � 0, and by hy­
pothesis it must therefore be an element of An. But if we take k = Ci - Cj + 1, we have 
k � 1 and 
hence 
C; + kb; � Cj + kbj, 
C; - Cj � k(b; - bj). (3) 
This is impossible, since C; - Cj = k - 1 is less than k, yet bj - bi � 1. It follows that 
(bl, ... , bn) must be an element of An. I 
Note that the hypothesis C #- 0 is necessary in Lemma 1, for if C is empty the set 
L( C, P) is also empty regardless of P. 
[This was the "minor slip".J 
BUT ... don't always use the first idea you think of. The proof above actually 
commits another sin against mathematical exposition, namely the unnecessary use of proof 
by contradiction. It would have been better to use a direct proof: 
Let (bl, ... , bn) be an arbitrary element of P, and let i and j be fixed subscripts with 
i < j; we wish to prove that b; � bj. Since C is nonempty, it contains some element 
(CI, ... ,cn). Now the vector (CI, . . . , cn) + k(bl, ... , bn) is an element of L(C,P) for all 
k � 0, and by hypothesis it must therefore be an element of An. But this means that 
Ci + kbi � Cj + kbj, i.e., 
C; - Cj � k(bj - b;), (3) 
for arbitrarily large k. Consequently bj - bi must be zero or negative. 
We have proved that bj - bi � 0 for all i < j ,  so the vector (bl, ... , bn) must be ,n 
element of An. I 
This form of the proof has other virtues too: It doesn't assume that the bi's 2 re 
integer-valued, and it doesn't require stating that CI 2··· � Cn· 
§3. AN ANSWER TO THE EXl UCISE] 
§4. Excerpts from class, October 7 [notes by TLL) 
Our first serious business involved examining "the worst abusers of the 'Don't use symbols 
in titles' rule." Professor Knuth (hereafter known as Knuth) displayed a paper by Gauss 
that had a long displayed formula in the title. He showed us a bibliography he's preparing 
that references not only that paper but another with even more symbols in the title. 
(Such titles make more than bibliographies difficult; they make bibliographic data retrieval 
systems and keyword-in-context produce all sorts of hiccups. )  
In his bibliography Knuth has tried to keep his citations true to the original sources. The 
bibliography contains mathematical formulas, full name spellings (even alternate spellings 
when common), and completely spelled-out source journal names. (This last may be 
unusual enough that some members of a field may be surprised to see the full journal 
name written out, but it's a big help to novices who want to find it in the library.) 
We spent the rest of class going over some of solutions that students had turned in for 
the exercise of §2 (each sample anonymous). He cautioned us that while he was generally 
pleased by the assignments, he was going to be pointing out things that could be improved. 
The following points were all made in the process of going through these samples. 
In certain instances, people did not understand what constitutes a proof. Fluency 
in mathematics is;mportant for Computer Science students but will not be taught 
in this class. 
Not all formulas are equations. Depending on the formula, the terms 'relation', 
'definition', 'statement', or 'theorem' might used. 
Computer Scientists must be careful to distinguish between mathematical notation 
and programming language notation. While it may be appropriate to use p[r) in a 
program, in a formal paper it is probably better to use p with a subscript of r. As 
another example, it is not appropriate to use a star (*) to denote multiplication in 
a paper about mathematics. Just say xy. 
Some people called p an element of P and Pr an element of p. Everything was an 
"element." It's better to call pr a "component" of p, thus distinguishing two kinds 
of subsidiary relationships. 
It is natural in mathematics to hold off some aspects of your definition - to "place 
action before definition" (as in 'p(x) < p(y) for some x < y'). But it is possible 
to carry this too far, if too much is being held back. The best location for certain 
definitions is a subjective matter. 
Remember to put words between adjacent formulas. 
When you use ellipses, such as (PI, . . .  , Pn), remember to put commas before and 
after the three dots. When placing ellipses between commas the three dots belong 
on the same level as the commas, but when the ellipsis is bracketed by symbols such 
as '+ '  or ' < '  the dots should be at mid-level. 
[§4· COMMENTS ON STUDENT ANSWERS (1) 9) 
[10 
Be careful with the spacing around ellipses. The character string' . . .  ;' looks strange 
(it should have more space after the last dot). All kinds of accidents happen con­
cerning spaces in formulas. Typesetting systems like TEX have built-in rules to 
cover 99% of the cases, but if you write a lot of mathematics you will get bitten. 
Linebreaks in the middle of formulas are undesirable. There are ways to enforce 
this with TEX (as well as other text formatting systems). People who use TEX and 
wish to use the vertical bar and the empty set symbol in notation like' {c IcE �}' 
should be aware of the TEX commands \mid and \emptyset. 
Comments such as, "We demonstrate the second conclusion by contradiction," and 
"There must be a witness to the unsortedness of P," are useful because they tell the 
reader what is going on or bring in new and helpful vocabulary. 
Numbering all displayed formulas is usually a bad idea; number the important ones 
only. Extraneous parentheses can also be distracting. For example, in the phrase 
"let k be (Ci - Cj) + 1," the parentheses should omitted. 
You can overdo the use of any good tool. For instance, you could overuse typo­
graphic tools by having 20 different fonts in one paper. 
Two more topics were touched on (and are sure to be discussed further): the use of 'I' in 
technical writing, and the use of past or present tense in technical wri ting. 
Knuth says that Mary-Claire van Leunen defends the use of'!' in scholarly articles, but 
that he disagrees (unless the identity of the author is important to the reader). Knuth 
likes the "teamwork" aspect of using 'we' to represent the author and reader together. If 
there are multiple authors, they can either "revel in the ambiguity" of continuing to use 
'we', or they can use added disambiguating text. If one author needs to be mentioned 
separately, the text can say 'one of the authors (DEK)', or 'the first author', but not 'the 
senior au thor'. 
Knuth (hereafter known as Don) recommends that one of two approaches be used with 
respect to tenses of verbs: Either use present tense throughout the entire paper, or write 
sequentially. Sequential writing means that you say things like, "We saw this before. We 
will see this later." The sequential approach is more appropriate for lengthy papers. You 
can use it even more effectively by using words of duration: "We observed this long ago. 
We saw the other thing recently. We will prove something else soon." 
§4. COMMENTS ON STUDENT ANSWERS (//1 
§s. Excerpts from class, October 9 [notes by TLL} 
"I'm thinking about running a contest for the best Pascal program that is also a sonnet," 
was the one of the first sentences out of Don's mouth on the topic of the exact definition 
of "Mathematical Writing." He admitted that such a contest was "probably not the 
right topic for this course." However, a program (presumably even an iambic pentameter 
program) is among the documents that he will accept as the course term paper. He 
will accept articles for professional journals, chapters of books or theses, term papers for 
other courses, computer programs, user manuals or parts thereof: anything that falls into 
a definite genre where you have a specific audience in mind and the technical aspect is 
significant. 
We spent the rest of class continuing to examine the homework assignment. In the interest 
of succinct notes, I have replaced many literal phrases by their generic equiva.lents. For 
example, I might have replaced' A > B' by '(relation)'. This time I have divided the com­
ments into two sets: those dealing with what I will call "form" (parentheses, capitalization, 
fonts, etc.) and those dealing with "content" (wording, sentence construction, tense, etc.). 
First, the comments concerning form: 
Don't overdo the use of colons. While the colon in 'Define it as follows:' is fine, the 
one in 'We have: (formula)' should be omitted since the formula just completes the 
sentence. Some papers had more colons than periods. 
Should the first word after a colon be capitalized? Yes, if the phrase following the 
colon is a full sentence; No, if it is a sentence fragment. (This is not "yet" a standard 
rule, but Don has been trying it for several years and he likes it.) 
While too many commas will interfere with the smooth flow of a sentence, too 
few can make a sentence difficult to read. As examples, a sentence beginning wi th 
'Therefore, 
, 
does not need the comma following 'therefore'. But 'Observe that if 
(symbol) is (formula) then so is (symbol) because (reasoning)' at least needs a 
comma before 'because'. 
Putting too many things in parentheses is a stylistic thing that can get very tiring. 
(When Don moves from his original, handwritten draft to a typed, computer-stored 
version his most frequent change is to remove extra parentheses.) 
Among the parentheses most in need of removal are nested parentheses. To this end, 
it is better to write '(Definition 2)' than '(definition (2))'. Unfortunately, however, 
you can't use the former if the definition was given in displayed formula (2). Then 
it's probably best to think of a way to avoid the outer parentheses altogether. 
In some cases your audience may expect nested parentheses. In this case (or in any 
other case when you feel you must have them), should the outer pair be changed to 
brackets (or curly-braces)? This was once the prevailing convention, but it is now 
not only obsolete but potentially dangerous; brackets and curly braces have semantic 
content for many scientific professionals. ("The world is short of delimiters," says 
[§5. COMMENTS ON STUDENT ANSWERS (2) 11) 
[12 
Don. ) Typographers help by using slightly larger parentheses for the outer pair in 
a nested set. 
An entire paper or proof in capital letters is distracting. It gives the impression of 
sustained shouting. Same goes for boldface, etc. 
Paul Halmos introduced the handy convention of placing a box at the end of a 
proof; this box serves the same function as the initials 'Q.E .D . ' .  If you use such a 
box, it seems best to leave a space between it and the final period. 
Try to make it clear where new paragraphs begin . When using displayed formulas, 
this can become confusing unless you are careful. 
Using notationa.l or typographic conventions can be helpful to your readers (as long 
as your convention is appropriate to your audience). Boldface symbols or arrows 
over your vectors are each appropriate in the correct context. When using a raised 
'st' in phrases such as 'the i+1 ,t component', it 's better to use roman type: 'i+1" '. 
Then it 's clear that you aren't speaking of "1 raised to the power st." 
Avoid "psychologically bad" line breaks. This is subjective, but you can catch many 
such awkward brea.ks by not letting the final symbol lie on a line separate from the 
rest of its sentence. If you are using TEX, a tilde ( - ) in place of a space will cause the 
two symbols on either side of the tilde to be tied together. (Other text processors 
also have methods to disallow line breaks at specific points .) 
Some of us are much better at spelling than others of us. Those of us who are not 
naturally wonderful spellers should learn to use spelling checkers. 
Allowing formulas to get so long that they do not format well or are unnecessarily 
confusing "violates the principle of 'name and conquer' that makes mathematics 
readable." For example, 'v = c + U(Ci - Cj + 1)' should be 'v = C + k", where 
k = Ci - Cj + 1', if you're going to do a lot of formula manipulation in which 
(Ci - Cj + 1) rema.ns as a unit. 
Be stingy with your quotation marks. "Three cute things in quotes is a little too 
cute." 
Remember to minimize subscripts . For example, 'Pi is an element of p' could more 
easily be 'P is an element of P'. 
Remember to capitalize words like theorem and lemma in titles like Lemma 1 and 
Theorem 23. 
Remember to place words between adjacent formulas. A particularly bad example 
was , "Add P k times to c." 
Be careful to define symbols before you use them (or at least to define them very 
near where you use them) .  
§5. COMMENTS O N  STUDENT ANSWERS (2)) 
Don't get hung up on one or two styles of sentences. The following sort of thing 
can become very monotonous: 
Thus, - ---. 
Consequently, -- - -. 
Therefore, - - - - . 
And so, -- - - . 
On the other hand, parallelism should be used when it is the point of the sentence. 
Now the comments involving content: 
Try to make sentences easily comprehensible from left to right . For example, "We 
prove that (grunt) and (snort) implies (blah)." It would be better to write "We 
prove that the two conditions (grunt) and (snort) imply (blah)." Otherwise it 
seems at first that (grunt) and (snort) are being proved. 
While guidelines have been given for the use of the word 'that', the final placement 
must be dictated by cadence and darity. Read your words aloud to yourself. 
The word 'shall' seems to be a natural word for definitions to many mathematical 
readers, but it is considered formal by younger members of the audience. 
Be precise in your wording. If you mean "not nonincreasing," don't say "increasing"; 
the former means that Pi < Pj+1 for some j ,  while the latter that Pi < Pj+1 for 
all j. 
Avoid passive voice. (My temptation to write, "Passive voice is bad," was over­
whelming. )  For example, replace "It can be shown . . . " by "A proof shows . . .  " . 
Mixed tenses on the same subject are awkward. For example, "We assume now 
(grunt), hoping to show a contradiction," is better than, "We assume now (grunt), 
and will show that this leads to a contradiction." 
Many people used the ungainly phrase "Assume by contradiction that (blah) ." It 
is better to say, "The proof that (blah) is by contradiction," and even better to say 
"To prove (grunt), let us assume the opposite and see what happens." 
In general, a conversational tone giving signposts and clearly written transition 
paragraphs provides for pleasant reading. One especially easy-to-read proof con­
tained the phrases "The operative word is zero," "The lemma is half proved," and 
"We divide the proof into two parts, first proving (blah) and then proving (grunt)." 
You can give relations in two ways, either saying 'Pi < Pi' or 'Pi> Pi'. The latter is 
for "people who are into dominance," Don says, but the former is much easier for a 
reader to visualize after you've just said 'P = (PI, Pl, . . .  ,Pn) and i < j'. Similarly, 
don't say 'i < j and Pi < Pi '; keep i and j in the same relative position.

§6. Excerpts from class, October 12 [notes by TLL] 
Don opened class by saying that up until now he has been criticizing our writing; now he 
will show us what he does to his own. Perhaps apropos showing us his own writing he 
quoted Dijkstra: "A good teacher will teach his students the importance of style and how 
to develop their own style-not how to mimic his." 
First he showed us a letter from Bob Floyd. The letter opened by saying 'Don, Please stop 
using so many exclamation points!' and closed with at least five exclamation points. After 
receiving this letter he looked in The Art of Computer Programming and found about two 
exclamation points per page. (Among the other biographical tidbits we learned at this 
class were that Don went to secretarial school, types 80 words per minute, and once knew 
two kinds of shorthand.) 
Don is writing a book with Oren Patashnik and Ron Graham. The book is entitled 
Concrete Mathematics and is to be used for CS 260. He showed us two copies of Chapter 
Five of this book: one copy he called "Before" and one he called "After". 
The Before copy actually carne into existence long after the work on the book began. Oren 
wrote several drafts using the ]}TEX book style, and then the authors availed themselves 
of the services of a book designer. The designer decided how wide the text was, what 
fonts were to be used, what chapter headings looked like, and a host of other things. The 
designer, at the authors request, has left room in the inner margins for "graffiti". That is, 
for informal snappy comments from the peanut gallery. (This idea was "stolen" from the 
booklet Approaching Stanford.) 
The After copy is just another formally typeset revision of the Before copy. N ei ther copy 
has yet been through a professional copy editor. Having now mentioned copy editors and 
book designers, Don said, "In these days of author self-publishing, we must not forget the 
value of professionals." (Actually, the copy edi tor was first mentioned when an error in 
punctuation was displayed on the screen.) 
Upon receiving a question from the audience concerning how many times he actually 
rewrites something, Don told us (part of) his usual rewrite sequence: 
His first copy is written in pencil. Some people compose at a terminal, but Don says, "The 
speed at which I write by hand is almost perfectly synchronized with the speed at which 
I think. I type faster than I think so I have to stop, and that interrupts the flow." 
In the process of typing his handwritten copy into the computer he edits his composition 
for flow, so that it will read well at normal reading speed. Somewhere around here the 
text gets TEXed, but the description of this stage was tangled up with the description of 
the process of rewriting the composition. Of course, rewriting does not all occur at any 
one stage. As Don said, "You see things in different ways on the different passes. Some 
things look good in longhand but not in type." 
While discussing his own revisions, he mentioned those of two other Computer Science 
authors. Nils Nilsson had at least five different formal drafts of his "Non-Monotonic Rea­
soning" chapter. Tony Hoare revised the algorithm in his paper on "Communicating 
Sequential Processes" more than a dozen times over the course of two years. 
§6. PREPARING BOOKS FOR PUBLICATION (li] 
Don, obviously a fan of rewriting 'in general, told us that he knows of many computer 
programs that were improved by scrapping everything after six months and starting from 
scratch. He said that this exact approach was used at Burroughs on their Algol compiler 
in 1960 and the result was what Don considers to be one of the best computer programs 
he has ever seen. On the limits of the usefulness of rewriting, he did say, "Any writing can 
be improved. But eventually you have to put something out the door." 
The last part of class was spent discussing the font used in the coming book: Euler. 
The Euler typeface was designed by Hermann Zapf ( "probably the greatest living type 
designer" ) and is an especially appropriate font to use in a book that is all about Euler's 
work. The idea of the face is that is supposed to look a bit handwritten. For example, the 
zero to be used for mathematics has a point at the apex because "when people write zeros, 
they never really close them" . This zero is different from the zero used in the text ( for 
example, in a date), so book preparation with Euler needs more care than usual. You ha,'e 
to distinguish mathematical numerals from English-language numerals in the manuscript .  
Somebody asked about 'all' versus 'all of'. Which should it be? Answer: That's a very 
good question. Sometimes one way sounds best, sometimes the other. You have to use 
your ear. Another tricky business is the position of 'only' and 'also'; Don says he keeps 
shifting those words around when he edits for tiow. 
§7. Excerpts from class, October 1 4  (notes by PMRj 
Don discussed the labours of the book designer and showed us specimen "page plans" and 
example pages. The former are templates for the page and show the exact dimensions of 
margins, paragraphs, etc. His designer also suggested a novel scheme for equations: They 
are to be indented much like paragraphs rather than being centered in the traditional 
way. We also saw conventions for the display of algorithms and tables. Although Don 
is doing his own typesetting, he is using the services of the designer and copy editor. 
These professionals are well worth their keep, he said. Economists in the audience were 
not surprised to hear that the prices of books bear almost no relation to their production 
costs. Hardbacks are sometimes cheaper to produce than paperbacks. For those interested 
in such things, Don recommended a paperback entitled One Book Six Ways (available in 
the Bookstore) that describes the entire production process by means of actual documents. 
Returning to the editing of his Concrete Maths text, Don went through more of the Before 
and After pages he began to show us on Monday, picking out specific examples that 
illustrate points of general interest. 
He exhorted writers to try to put themselves in their readers' shoes: "Ask yourself what 
the reader knows and expects to see next at some point in the text." Ideally, the finished 
version reads so simply and smoothly that one would never suspect that had been rewritten 
at alL For example, part of the Concrete Math draft said 
(Before) The general rule is ( . , .  ) and it is particularly val�able.
because ( . .
.
. ) . 
The transformation in (5. 12) is called ( . " ). It IS easIly proved· smce 
( . .  , and . . .  ) . 
[§7 .  PREPARING BOOKS FOR PUBLICATION (2) 1 '; ; 
[ 16  
Reading this at speed and in context made i t  dear that readers would be hanging on their 
chairs wondering why the rule was true; so we should first tell them why, before stressing 
the rule's significance: 
(After) The general rule is ( . . .  ) and it is easily proved since ( . . .  and . . .  ). 
[new paragraph] Identity (5. 12) is particularly valuable because ( . . .  ) . 
It is called ( . . .  ) .  
Don's favorite dictionary was of no help on the question of 'replace with' vs. 'replace by' . 
The phrase 'by replacing - - by - - ' is bad (due to the repetition), and 'by replacing - -
with - - ' seems worse. In this case the solution is to choose another word: 'by changing 
- - to - - ' . 
As a very general rule, try reading at speed. You will often get a much better sense of the 
rhythm of the sentence than you did when you wrote it .  
It is a bad idea to display false equations. The reader's eye is apt to alight upon them in 
the text and treat . them as gospel. It is much better to put them into the text, as in "So 
the equation ' . . .  ' is always false!" 
Be sure that the antecedent of any pronoun that you use is clear. For example, the previous 
paragraph has two sentences beginning 'It is . . .  ' ;  they are fine. But sometimes such a 
sentence structure is troublesome because 'i t '  seems to be referring to an object under 
discussion. For example, 
(Before) Two things about the derivation are worthy of note. First, it's a great 
convenience to be summing . . . . 
(After) Two things about this derivation are worthy of note. First, we see again 
the great convenience of summing . . . . 
Towards the end of the editing process you will need to ensure that you don't have a page 
break in the middle of a displayed formula. Often you'll simply have to think up something 
else to say to fill up the page, thus pushing the displayed formula entirely onto the next 
page. Try to think of this as a stimulus to research! 
Let proofs follow the same order as definitions, e.g., where you have to deal with several 
separate cases. 
Hyphens, dashes, and minus signs are distinct and should not be used interchangeably. 
The shortest is the hyphen. The next is the en-dash, as in 'lines 10-18'. Longer still is the 
minus sign, used in formulae: ' 10 - 18 = -8'. The longest of all is the em-dash-used in 
sentences. 
When proofreading you may catch technica.l errors as well as stylistic errors. Think about 
the mathematics too, not just the prose. For example, the book was discussing a purported 
argument that 0° should be undefined "because the functions xO and 0' have different 
limiting values when x -+ 0" . Don revised this statement to " . . .  when x decreases to 0," 
because 0' is undefined when x -+ 0 through negative values. 
§7.  PREPARING BOOKS FOR PUBLICATION (2)1 
When you use the word 'instead' ,  be clear about the contrast you are drawing. The read'T 
should immediately understand what you are referring to: 
(Before) And when x = - 1 instead, . . . 
(After) And when x = -1 instead of +1 ,  . . .  
Notice the helpful use of a redundant ' + ' sign here. 
Use the present tense for timeless facts. Things that we proved some time ago are ne,·pr­
theless still true. 
Try to avoid repeating words in a sentence. 
(Before) - - approach the values - - fill in the values - - . 
(After) - - approach the values - - fill in the entries - - . 
In answer to a question from the class, Don suggested giving page numbers only for remote 
references ( to equations, say). Usually it is enough to say 'using Equation 5 .14' or whatever. 
It becomes unwieldy to give page numbers for every single such reference. A member of 
the class suggested the 'freeway method' for numbering tables; number them with the page 
number on which they appear. Don confessed that he hadn't thought of this one. Sounds 
like a neat idea. 
The formula 
(Before) L G) (k - �) = -m; 1 (m � 1) k:'Om 
looks a bit confusing because of the minus sign on the right, 50 Don 
changed it to 
(After) k� G) G - k) = m; 1 (m � 1) . 
There may be many ways to write a formula; you have the freedom to select the best. 
(This change also propagated into the subsequent text, where a reference to ' the factor 
(k  - r/2) '  had to be changed to 'the factor (r/2 - k) ' . 
Somebody saw an integral sign on that page and asked about the relative merits of 
versus other notations like 
a x = a  J f(x) dx J f(x) dx . 
- 00  % = - 00  
Don said that putting limits above and below, instead of at the right, traded vertical space 
for horizontal"space, so it depends on how wide your formulas are: Both forms are used. 
[§7 . PREPARING BOOKS FOR PUBLrCATION (2) J 7] 
[ 1 8  
Whichever form you adopt should be consistent throughout an entire book. Somebody 
suggested 
but Don pooh-poohed this. 
He said that major writing projects each have their own style; you get to understand the 
style that's appropriate as you write more and more of the book, just as novelists learn 
about the characters they are creating as they develop a story. In Concrete Mathema tics 
he is learning how to use the idea of "graffiti in the margin" as he writes more. One nice 
application is to quote from the first publications of important discoveries; thus famous 
mathematicians like Leibniz join the writers of 20th century graffiti .  
§8. Excerpts from class, October 16 [notes by TLL] 
We continued to examine Before and After pages from the book of which Don is a co­
author. The following points were made in reference to changes Don decided to make. 
When long formulas don't fit, try to break the lines logically. In some cases the 
author can even change some of the math (perhaps by introducing a new symbol) to 
make the formula placement less jarring. Such a change is best made by the author, 
since the choice of how to display a complex expression is an important part of any 
mathematical exposition. 
Sometimes moving a formula from embedded text to one separately displayed will 
allow the formula to be more logically divided. The placement of the equals sign ( = )  
is different for line breaks in the middle of displayed versus embedded formulas: The 
break comes after the equals sign in an embedded formula, but before the equals 
sign in a display. 
While editing for flow, sentences can be broken up by changing semicolons to peri­
ods; or if you want the sentences to join into a quickly moving blur, you can change 
periods to semicolons. Breaking existing paragraphs into smaller paragraphs can 
also be helpful here. 
While making such changes make sure to preserve clarity. For example, make sure 
that any sentences you create that begin with conjunctions are constructed clearly. 
and that words like 'it' have clear antecedents. (Sentences that begin with the word 
'And' are not always evil. )  
Make sure your variable names are not misleading. Variable names that are too 
similar to conceptually unrelated variables can be confusing. Systematic variable 
renaming is one of the advantages of text editors. 
We noted last time that present tense is correct for facts that are still true; but i t  
is  okay to use past tense for "facts" that have turned out to be in error. 
§8 .  PREPARING BOOKS FOR P UBLICATfOS 1 . 1 .  
One of the most common errors that mathematicians make when they get their own 
typesetting systems is to over-use the form of fraction with a horizontal bar ( I +r ) y 
rather than a slash (( 1 + x )/y) . The stacked form can lead to tiny little numbers­
especially when they are used in exponents. One of the most common changes that 
mathematical copy editors make is to slash a mathematician's fractions. (They even 
know that they have to add parentheses when they do this.) 
..-
Exercises are some of the most difficult parts of a book to write. Since an exercise 
has very little context, ambiguity can be especially deadly; a bit of carefully chosen 
redundancy can be especially important. For this reason, exercises are also the 
hardest technical writing to translate to other languages. 
Copyright law has changed, making it technically necessary to give credit to nil 
previously published exercises. Don says that crediting sources is probably sufficient 
(he doesn't plan to write every person referenced in the exercises for his new book. 
unless the publisher insists). Tracing the history of even well-known theorems c a n  
be difficult, because mathematicians have tended to omit citations. He recently 
spent four hours looking through the collected works of Lagrange trying to find the 
source of "Lagrange's inequality," but he was unsuccessful. Therefore he's not too 
unhappy with the new law. 
We can dispense with some of our rhetorical guidelines when writing the answers to 
exercises. Answers that are quick and pithy, and answers that start with a symbol. 
are quite acceptable. 
§g. Excerpts from class, October 16  (continued) [notes by TLL] 
From esoteric mathematics we moved on to reference books. Don showed us six such books 
that he likes to have next to him when he writes. 
1 .  The Oxford English Dictionary (usually called the OED). He showed us the two 
volum� "squint print" edition rather than the 16-volume set. This compact edition 
is ofte'n offered as a bonus given to new members upon joining a book club. (There 
is a project in Toronto that is will have the entire OED online.) 
2. The OED Supplement. The supplement brings the OED up to date. The supple­
ment comes in four volumes, each of which costs $100 or more, so you may have to 
go to the library for this one. 
3. The American Heritage Dictionary. Don likes this dictionary because of the usage 
notes and the Appendix containing Indo-European root words. (For example, the 
usage notes will help you choose between 'compare to' or 'compare with' in a specific 
sentence. )  
4 .  The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Instead of the historical words 
found in the previously mentioned dictionaries, this one has the words used on 
the street. Current slang and popular usage are explained in very simple English. 
[§g .  HANDY REFERENCE BOOKS 
[ 20 
(For example, the nuances of 'mind-bending' versus 'mind-blowing' wrsus 'mind­
boggling' are explained. )  
5 .  Webster's New Word Speller Divider. Don said that people who don't spell well find 
this book to be quite useful. [I saw no indication that he actually uses it, though.] 
6. Roget 's Thesaurus. This book is a synonym dictionary. Don says that he owns two, 
one for home and one for his Stanford office, and he uses them in many different 
ways: when he knows that a word exists but has forgotten it; when he wants to 
avoid repetition; when he wants to define a new technical term or a new name for 
a paper or program. 
The issue of British versus American dialect came up. When wntmg for international 
audiences, should we use British or American spellings and conventions"? Don says he 
agrees with the rule that Americans should write with their own spellings and the British 
should do the same. The two styles should be mixed only when, say, an American writes 
about the ' labor of the British Labour Party'. (Readers of these classnotes will now 
understand why TLL and PMR spell some words differently. ) 
§ 1 0 .  Excerpts from class, October 19 [notes by TLL) 
Should this course have been named "Computer Scientifical Writing" or "Informatical 
Writing" rather than "Mathematical Writing"? The Computer Science Department is 
offering this class, but until now we have been talking about topics that are generally of 
concern to all writers who use mathematics. Today we begin to discuss topics specific to 
the writing of Computer Science. 
We are not abandoning mathematical concerns; Don says that a technical typist in Com­
puter Science must know all that a Math department typist must know plus quite a bit 
more. He showed us two examples where mathematical journals had trouble presenting 
programs, algorithms, or concrete mathematics in papers he wrote. In order to solve the 
first problem, Don had to convince the typesetters at Acta Arithmetica to create "floor" 
and "ceiling" functions by carving off small pieces of the metal type for square brackets. 
The second problem had to do with typographic conventions for computer programs; The 
American Mathematical Monthly was using different fonts for the same symbol at different . .  
d ' t h bl ' u n ,, "  d " " t  t pomts m a proce ure, was m erc angea y usmg : =  , : = , an =: 0 represen an 
assignment symbol. 
Stylistic conventions for programming languages originated with Algol 60. Prior to 1960. 
FORTRAN and assembly languages were displayed using all uppercase letters in variable 
width fonts that did not mix letters and numbers in a pleasant manner. Fortunately, Algol's 
visual presentation was treated with more care: Myrtle Kellington of ACM worked from 
the beginning with Peter Naur (editor of the Algol report) to produce a set of conventions 
concerning, among other things, indentation and the treatment of reserved words. 
Don found the prevailing variable-width fonts unacceptable for use in the displayed com­
puter programs in Volume 1 of The Art of Computer Programming, and he insisted that 
§ 1O .  PRESENTING ALGORITH.\/S ] 
he needed fixed width type. The publishers initially said that it wasn·t possible, but they 
eventually found a way to mix typewriter style with roman, bold, and italic. 
Don says he had a difficult time trying to decide how to present algorithms. He could 
have used a specific programming language, but he was afraid that such a choice would 
alienate people (either because they hated the language or because they had no access to 
the language) .  So he decided to write his algorithms in English. 
His Algorithms are presented rather like Theorems with labeled steps; often they have 
accompanying (but very high-level) flow charts (a  technique he first saw in Russian liter­
ature of the 1950s). The numbered steps have parenthetical remarks that we would call 
comments; after 1968 these parenthetical remarks are often invariant relations that can be 
used in a formal proof of program correctness. 
Don has received many letters complimenting him on his approach, but he says it is not 
really successful. Explaining why, he said, "People keep saying, 'I'm going to present an 
algorithm in Knuth's style,' and then they completely botch it by ignoring the conventions 
I think are most important . This style must just be a personal style that works for me. 
So get a personal style that works for you." In recent papers he has used the pidgin Algol 
style introduced by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman; but he will not change his style for the 
yet-unfinished volumes of The Art of Computer Programming because he wants to keep 
the entire series consistent. 
Don says that a computer program is a piece of literature. ( "I look forward to the day 
when a Pulitzer Prize will be given for the best computer program of the year." ) He 
says that, apart from the benefit to be gained for the readers of our programs, he finds 
that treating programs in this manner actually helps to make them run smoothly on the 
computer. ( "Because you get it right when you have to think about it that way." )  
He gave us a reprint of "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley, from Communications of 
the ACM 29 (May 1986), pages 364-369, and told us we had best read it by Wednesday 
since it will be an important topic of discussion. Don, who was 'guest oyster' for this 
installment of "Programming Pearls," warned us that "this represents the best thing to 
come out of the TEX project. If you don't  like it, try to conceal your opinions until this 
. " course IS over. 
Bentley published that article only after Don had first published the idea of "literate 
programming" in the British Computer Journal. (Don says that he chose the term in 
hopes of making the originators of the term "structured programming" feel as guilty when 
they write illiterate programs as he is made to feel when he writes unstructured programs.) 
When Bentley wanted to know why Don did not publish this in America, Don said that 
Americans are illiterate and wouldn't care anyway. Bentley seems to have disagreed with 
at least part of that statement. (As did many of his readers: The article was so popular 
that there will now be three columns a year devoted to literate programming.) 
As Don began explaining the "WEB" system, he restated two previously mentioned princi­
ples: The correct way to explain a complex thing is to break it into parts and then explain 
each part; and things should be explained twice (formally and informally) .  These two 
principles lead: naturally to programs made up of modules that begin with text (informal 
[§ 1O .  PRESENTING ALGORITHMS 2 1 ]  
[££ 
explanation) and finish wi th Pascal ( formal explanation) .  
The WEB system allows a programmer to keep one source file that can produce either a 
typesetting file or a programming language source file, depending on the transforming 
program used. 
Monday's final topic was the "blight on the industry" : user manuals. Don would like us 
to bring in some really stellar examples of bad user manuals. He tried to find some of 
his favorites but found that they had been improved (or hidden) when he wasn 't looking . 
While he could have brought in the improved manuals, bad examples are much more fUll. 
He showed a brand-new book, The AWK Programming Language, to illustrate a principle 
often used by the writers of user manuals: Try to write for the absolute novice. He says 
that many manuals say just that, but then proceed to use jargon that even some f'xperts 
are uncomfortable with. While the AWK book does not explicitly state this goal. the 
authors (Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan = AWK) told him that they had this goal in mind. 
But the book fails to be comprehensible by novices .  It fails because, as Don says , "If you 
are a person who has been in the field for a long time, you don't realize when you are 
using jargon." However, Don says that just because the AWK book fails to meet this goal 
does not mean that it isn't a good book. ( "Perhaps the best book in Computer Science 
published this year." ) He explains this by saying, "If you try to write for the novice. you 
will communicate with the experts-otherwise you communicate with nobody. "  
§ l.1. Excerpts from class, October 21 [notes by P MRj 
Don opened class with the good news that Mary-Claire van Leunen has agreed to help 
read the term papers and drafts thereof, despite the fact that her name was incorrect.ly 
capitalized in last week's notes. 
Returning to the subject of "Literate Programming," Don said that it takes a while to find 
a new style to suit a new system like WEB. When he was trying to write the WEB program 
in its own language he tore up his first 25 pages of code and started again, having finally 
found a comfortable style. He digressed to talk about the vicious circle involved in writing 
a program in its own language. To break it, he hand-simulated the program on itself to 
produce a Pascal program that could then be used to compile WEB programs. The task was 
eased because there is obviously no need for error-handling routines when dealing with 
code that you have to debug anyway. But there is also another kind of bootstrapping 
going on; you can evolve a style to write these programs only by sitting down and writing 
programs. Don told us that he wrote WEB in just two months, as it was never intended to 
be a polished product like '!EX. 
We spent the rest of the class looking at WEB programs that had been written by under­
graduates doing independent research with Don during the Spring. We saw how they had 
(or had not) adapted to its style. Don said that he had got a lot of feedback and some­
times found it hard to be dispassionate about stylistic questions, but that some things 
were clearly wrong. He showed us an example that looked for all the world just· like a 
Pascal program; the student had obviously not changed his ways of thinking or wri ting at 
§ l l .  LITERATE PROGRAlvlMING (J I i  
all, and so had failed to make any use of the features of the system. The English i n  his 
introductory paragraph also left a lot to be desired. 
Don showed us his thick book 'Tp;X: The Program - a listing of the code for 'JE,'(, written 
in WEB. It consists of almost 1400 modules. The guiding principle behind WEB is that each 
module is introduced at the psychologically right moment. This means that the program 
can be written in such a way as to motivate the reader, leaving TANGLE to sort everything 
'. . out later on. [The TANGLE processor converts WEB programs to Pascal programs.] After 
all, we don't need to worry about motivating the compiler. (Don added the aside that 
contrary to superstition, the machine doesn't spend most of its time executing those parts 
of the code that took us the longest to write.) It seems to be true that the best way in 
which to present program constructs to the reader is to use the same order in which the 
creator of the program found himself making decisions about them. Don himself always 
felt it was quite clear what had to be presented next,  throughout the entire composition 
of this huge program. There was at all points a natural order of exposition, and it seems 
that the natural orderings for reading and writing are very much the same. 
The first student hadn't used this new flexibility at all; he had essentially just used WEB to 
throw in comments here and there. 
A general problem of exposition arose: How are we to describe the behavior of a computer 
program? Do we see the program as essentially autonomous, "running itself," or are we 
participants in the action? Our attitude to this determines whether we are going to say 
'we insert the element in the heap' or 'it inserts the element . . .  '. Don favours 'we'; at 
any rate one should be consistent. 
Students used descriptors and imperatives for the names of their modules; Don said he 
favours the latter, as in ( Store the word in the dictionary ) ,  which works much better than 
( Stores the word in the dictionary ) .  On the other hand, where a module is essentially 
a piece of text with a declarative function-a list of declarations, say-we should use a 
descriptor to name it: ( Procedures for sorting ) .  
Incidentally, it is natural to capitalize the first letter of a module name. 
One student used the identifier 'FindinNew Word3'.  This looks comparatively bad in print: 
Uppercase let ters were not designed to appear immediately following lowercase ones. Since 
the use of compound nouns is almost inevitable, WEB provides a neat solution. It allows 
a short underscore to be used to conjoin words like geLword . (Since the Pascal compiler 
will not accept identifiers like this, TANGLE quietly removes the underscore.)  Don told us 
that Jim Dunlap of Digitek, who made some of the best early compilers, invariably used 
identifiers forty-or-so characters long. The meaning was always quite clear although no 
comments appeared. 
Each module should contain an informal but clear description of what it actually does. A 
play-by-play account of an algorithm, a simple stepping through of the process, does not 
qualify. We are trying to convey an intuition of what is going on, so a high-level account 
is much more helpful. 
We saw several modules that were much too long. Don thinks that a dozen lines of code 
is about the right length for a module. Often he simply recommended that the students 
[§ 11 . LITERATE PROGRAMMING (1) J.'I ' 
[24 
cut the offending specimens into several pieces, each of more manageable size. The whole 
philosophy behind WEB is to break a complex thing into tractable parts. so the code should 
reflect this. Once you get the idea, you begin writing code this way. and it's easier. 
We saw an example in which the student had slipped into "engineerese" in his descriptive 
text-all conjunctions and no punctuation. This worked for James Joyce, but it doesn't 
make for good documentation. One student had apparently managed to break WEB-the 
formatting of begins and ends came out all wrong. Heaven knows what he did. 
One student put comments after each end to show what was being ended, as end { while } .  
This is a good idea idea when writing Pascal, but it's unnecessary in WEB. Thus it's a good 
example of a convention that is no longer appropriate to the new style; when you change 
style you needn't carry excess baggage along. 
Don had more to say about the anthropomorphization of computer systems. Why prompt 
the user with ' Name of file to process?' when we can have the computer say 'What 
f i l e  should I proce s s? ' ?  Don generally likes the use of ' I '  by the computer when 
referring to itself, and thinks this makes it easier for users to conceptualize what is going 
on. Perhaps humans can think of complex processes best in terms of demons in boxes, 
so why not acknowledge this? Eliza, the AI program that simulates a certain type of 
psychiatrist, managed to fool virtually everyone by an extension of this approach. Eliza 
may or may not be a recommendation for anthropomorphisms, or for psychiatry. There 
are those, such as Dijkstra, who think such use of 'I' to be a bad thing. 
As in the case of maths, don't start a sentence with a symbol. So don't say ' data assumes 
that . . .  '-it can easily be rewritten. 
We saw several programs by one student who had developed a very distinctive and (Don 
thought) colourful style. His prose is littered with phrases like "Oooops! Ho\\' can we 
fix this?" and "Now to get down to the nitty-gritty!" This stream-of-consciousness style 
really does seem to motivate reading, and helps infect the reader with the author's obvious 
enthusiasm. There were a few small nits to pick with this guy though: His descriptions 
could often be more descriptive. Why not call a variable caps_range instead of just range? 
Don also had to point out to him that 'complement' and 'component' are in fact two 
different words. 
In WEB you can declare your variables at any point in the program. Don thinks it is always 
a good idea to add some comment when you do so, even if only a very cursory explanation 
is needed. 
A note about asterisks: Be warned that typeset asterisks tend to appear higher above the 
line than typewritten ones, so your multiplication formulre may come out looking strange. 
Better to use x for multiplication, and to use a typewriter-style font with body-centered 
'.' symbols instead of the '.' in normal typographic fonts. 
Another freshman was digitizing the Mona Lisa for reasons best known to insiders of Don's 
research project. Don pointed out that since the program uses a somewhat specialized data 
structure (the heap) that might be unknown to the readers, the author should keep all the 
heap routines together in the text so that they can be read as a group while fresh -in the 
reader's mind. In WEB we are not constrained by top-down, bottom-up, or any other order. 
§ l l .  LITERATE PROGRA MMI.VG ( l ! j  
This student capitalized the first letter of every word in titles of modules, e'-en ' _-\nd' 
and the like. This looks rather unnatural-it is better to follow the newspaper-headlines 
convention by leaving such words entirely in lowercase, and even better to capitalize only 
the first word. 
Don thought it a good idea to use typewriter type for hexadecimal numbers, for instance 
when saying '3F represents 63'. But leave the '63' in normal type. This convention looks 
appropriate and provides a kind of subliminal type-checking. 
The words used in the documentation should match the words used in the formal program­
you will only confuse the reader by using two different terms for the same thing. 
It's a good idea to develop the habit of putting your begins and ends inside the called 
modules, not putting them in the calling module. That is, do it like this: 
if down = 4 then ( Punt ) ;  
( Punt ) = 
Not like this: 
begin snap; 
place; 
kick; 
end 
if down = 4 then 
begin ( Punt ) ;  
end 
( Punt ) = 
snap; 
place; 
kick 
Incidentally, appalling bugs will occur if we mix the two conventions!

§ 12.  Excerpts from class, October 23 [notes by PMR] 
One of the chief aspects of WEB is to encourage better programming, not just better expo­
sition of programs. For example, many people say that around 25% of any piece of code 
should be devoted to error handling and user guidance. But this will typically mean that 
a subroutine might have 15 lines of 'what to do if the data is faulty' followed by one or 
two lines of 'what to do in the normal course of events'. The subroutine then looks very 
much like an error-handling routine. This fails to motivate the writer to do a good job; 
his heart just isn't in the error handling. WEB provides a solution to this. The procedure 
can have a single line near the beginning that says ( Check if the data is wrong 28 ) and 
points to another module. Thus the proper focus is maintained: In the main module we 
have code devoted to handling the normal cases, and elsewhere we have all the error-case 
instructions. The programmer never feels that he's writing a whole lot of stuff where he'd 
really much rather be writing something else; in module 28, it feels right to do the bf'st 
error detection and recovery. Don showed us an example of this from his undergradua te 
class in which a routine had two references of the form 
if . . .  then . . .  else char_error 
pointing to a " ery brief error-reporting module. 
\Ve looked at a program written by another student who had the temerity to include some 
comments critical of WEB. Don struck back with the following: 
It is good practice to use italics for the names of variables when they appear m 
comments. 
Let the variables III the module title correspond to the local parameters m the 
module itself. 
According to this student's comments, his algorithm uses 'tail recursion'. This is 
an impressive phrase, helpful in the proper context; but unfortunately that is not 
the kind of recursion his program uses. 
However, Don did grant that his exposition was good and gave a nice intuition of the 
functions of the modules. 
We saw a second program by the same student. It had the usual sprinkling of "wicked 
whiches"-'which's that should have been 'that's. The purpose of the program was to 
"enforce" the triangle inequality on a table of data that specified the distances between 
pairs of large cities in the US. Don commented here that his project (from which these 
programs came) intends to publish interesting data sets so that researchers in different 
phases can replicate each other's results. He also observed that a program running on a 
table of " real data," as here ( the actual "official" distances between the cities in question) 
is a lot more interesting than the same program running on "random data." Returning to 
the nitty-gritty of the program, Don observed that the student had made a good choice of 
variable names-for instance 'villain.' for those parts of the data that were causing incon­
sistences. This fitted in nicely with the later exposition; he could talk about 'cut throats' 
and so forth. (Don added that we nearly always find villainy pretty un amusing in real life. 
§ 12. LITERATE PROGRAMMliVG (21 1 
but the word makes for a witty exposition in artificial life; the English language has lots 
of vocabulary just waiting for such applications. )  
Don wondered aloud why i t  is that people talk about "the nth and mth positions" ( as this 
student had) thereby reversing the natural (or at any rate alphabetical) order? 
He also pointed to an issue that arises with the move from typewriters to computer 
typesetting-the fact that we now distinguish between opening and closing quotes. We 
saw an example where the student had written "main program" . To add to the confu­
sion, different languages have different conventions for quotes; in German they appear like 
this: "The Name of the Rose". How to represent this in a standard ASCII file remains a 
mystery. 
Back to the triangle inequality. Don pointed out that one obvious check for bad data in 
the distance table follows from the fact that the road distance can not be less than a Great 
Circle route. ( "It could, if you had a tunnel" commented a New Yorker in the audience.) 
The student had written a nice group of modules based on this fact ,  and it illustrated the 
WEB facility of being able to put displayed equations into comments. 
"SO WEB effectively just does macro substitution"!" asked another member of the class. 
Exactly, said Don. In fact the macros he uses are not very general-they really allow only 
one parameter. This means he doesn't need a complex parser, but in fact one can do a 
great deal within this restriction. For instance, it is not difficult to simulate two-parameter 
macros if we wish. 
Someone in the class commented that it seemed a little strange to put variable declarations 
in a different module from their use. Don said that this was OK as long as they are close 
to their use, but large procedures should have their local variables "distributed" as the 
exposition proceeds. 
Don recalled that older versions of Algol allowed you to declare a variable in the middle 
of a block. This fits in nicely with the WEB philosophy, but unfortunately cannot be done 
in modern Pascal. Indeed, Don became painfully aware of the limitations of Pascal for 
system programming when he was writing WEB-you can't have an array of file names, for 
example. He got around them, though, with macros. 
One example of improving Pascal via macros is to define (in WEB) 
string_type (#) == packed array [l :#J of char 
so that you can say things like 
name_code : string_type (2)  
when declaring a two-letter string variable. 
At this point, prompted by a note from Tracy, Don announced that 23 copies of the 
Handbook for Scholars had arrived in the Bookstore, with more to come. A resounding 
cheer echoed throughout Terman. 
Don commented that the student had called a certain variable called ' scan'. Since this 
variable was essentially a place marker, Don thought that a noun v{Quld be much better 
[§ 12 .  LITERATE PROGRAMMING (2) 271 
[28 
than a verb-'place', perhaps. Let the function determine the part of speech; think of it 
as a kind of Truth in Naming. Verbs are for procedures, not data. 
The last student had written a program to handle graph structures based on encounters 
between the characters in novels. He too had made the "quote mistake" . The student gave 
a nice characterization of the input and output of the program, using the typewriter font 
to illustrate data as it appears in a file. 
This student also showed a bit of inconsistency in the use of 'it' and 'we' as the personifi­
cation of his program. We seem to be finding the same old faults over and over now, Don 
said, so perhaps that indicates that we have found them all. Discuss. 
§13. Excerpts from class, October 26 [notes by PMR] 
We moved on to the subject of user manuals. Don was disappointed that nobody had 
responded to his request in a previous lecture to give him glaring examples of bad ones­
either they are being much better written these days or we hadn't taken him seriously. So 
instead, Don produced mini-sized user manuals written by CS graduate students for his 
class CS 304 earlier this year. The students had had to tackle five weird and wonderful 
problems in ten weeks; one of the problems had been to design and implement some 
software and to write a one-page user manual for the 'Digiflash' display system. This is 
the kind of thing you see in Times Square, and increasingly in bars and post offices, in 
which news and advertising flows across a sort of dot-matrix screen. In this case, the 
screen was to be a simple array of 8 by 256 pixels. The students had only two weeks in 
which to write the system and manual, which were then subject to the ultimate test, the 
truly Na'ive User. The idea was that the user would need no understanding of computers 
or of writing, but should still be able to use the system to produce a variety of visual 
effects. The students divided themselves into four teams and so we saw four solutions to 
the problem. 
A common failing was that terminology that seemed perfectly transparent meant nothing to 
Don's wife: "Menu" and "Scrolling" for example. Such terms are so familiar to CS people, 
it never occurs to them that these are actually technical terms. 
Don went through the solutions in ascending order of competence. The class reaction to 
this discussion might almost have led one to believe that some of the authors were sitting 
amongst us. 
Don digressed on the subject of 'i.e. '. Is it formal, he asked, or is it part of the language? 
He confessed that he was considering taking all the ' i .e.'s out of his new book. One thing 
he does know: You should always put a comma after 'i .e. ' .  (Except in this instance. )  
The first solution could be described as a very logical approach, almost an archetypically CS 
solution. The manual was essentially a hierarchy of definitions. The writers talked about 
MESSAGES (or MESSAGEs-consistency was not their watchword) when they wanted to 
say: 'here are objects that have a special meaning for us and whose definition you ought to 
know'. But, said Don, formal definitions are not the way to explain something to a novice. 
This write-up apparently thought the phrase LEFT-INDENTED to be self-explanatory, 
although it meant 'flush with the left margin' .  (Left unindented?) The user was prompted 
§ '3 . USER MANUALS] 
to enter 'Type of mes sage ( 1 -6 ) : '  Why should there be numeric types? Sentences like 
"And now you should ENTER the data" do nothing to help the user relax-the capitals 
look too much like DANGER SIGNS. 
Don's wife commented that one thing she always needs to know is "How do I get out of 
a mess if I do something wrong?" Don said that this is something manuals almost never 
explain-perhaps it  never occurs to their authors that somebody will eventually want to 
stop playing with their program. The solution we were looking at did have a one-line 
description of how to EXIT, but Don said even this is jargon. 
The second solution was Digiflash T M .  It had a good introductory and motivational para­
graph, albeit with a whole crowd of 'which's that should have been ' that's. Unfortunately 
it claimed that the system was very easy to use and understand-a claim that can rebound 
by making the user feel stupid. There was a major flaw in the program in that one was ex­
pected to hit OPTION-B to enter 'bold' mode, and then OPTION-B again to leave it. Don 
thought it would be far more natural to type OPTION-N (for 'normal ' )  instead. Option-V 
was "reverse video"-another jargon word, and why wasn't this OPTION-R? There were 
some cute options though: 'M' for 'slowly materializing' text, and an assortment of small 
animal logos that could be made to appear. 
The third solution was the DiJKSTra system, so named to keep it sufficiently Dutch 
(obscure in-joke, please ignore). The authors had a nice use of the phrase 'flashing bar' 
instead of the more technical 'cursor' (though for some reason they still felt impelled to 
define the latter as the former), and likewise they said 'hit return' instead of 'enter' (or 
worse, ENTER). They also kept their sentences nice and short. Another good idea was 
that the manual invited the user to type ' ? '  to get an online demonstration, thus sparing 
us a painful description of such arcane concepts as boldface italic reverse video fade-in 
mode and incidentally helping to keep the manual terse. If a picture is truly worth a 
thousand words, said somebody, then an animated demonstration must be worth at least 
a paragraph. One problem with this system was that the user is prompted for five or so 
paranleters every time he enters a new line, and the defaults are fixed. Wouldn't it be 
better, asked Don, to default to the style used for the preceding line? 
The last solution (though not even typeset, much less TEXed) Don declared to be the best. 
There was a good overview and a step-by-step description of the system; very friendly 
looking. Crisp sentences. Easy to skim. Helpful redundancy and diagrams. Don said 
that there's really nothing much you can do about the reader who insists on starting at 
a random point in the middle of a text. When he surreptitiously watches people looking 
at his books in the bookstore, he notices that they always start in the middle somewhere, 
not at the preface where he wanted them to read first. 
There was a good use of a symbol in the text to indicate the control key, and likewise 
diagrams of the keyboard to explain which keys to use for left , right, next message, previous 
message, etc. It was also good to emphasize that the control key must actually be held 
down while another key is typed (that is, they are not simply typed successively) .  Perhaps 
the main flaw was that the user was expected to realize that 'up' meant, in effect, 'go to 
the previous message' ;  and 'down', 'go to the next message' . To those unfa.miliar with 
full-screen editors, this mightn' t  be obvious. There was a. nice use of icons to describe 
[§ 1 3 .  USER MANUALS 29 1  
[SO 
scrolling up, down, left , or right though. One obscurity was the advice 
\THIS IS VISIBLE HERE I BUT NOT HERE 
Don declared that he didn't know what this was supposed to mean; it would be a lot better 
to say 'Extra long messages can be seen if you make them move'. 
It's good to have plenty of comments like 'Good luck!' and 'Enjoy" scattered here and 
there. But Don thought the phrase 'this system has been carefully redesigned not to bite' 
hardly reassuring. 
§ 1.4' Excerpts from class, October 26 (continued) [notes by PMR] 
In Don's mailbox today he found galley proofs from the ACM, to be corrected and returned 
within 48 hours of this time two weeks ago. Unphased by this injunction he went over the 
text with us. The Algol programs seemed to be laid out properly. There were occasional 
cryptic marginal notes: 'Bad proof, Camera copy OK'. He took this to mean that his copy 
was made by a laser printer instead of a phototypesetting machine. vVe learned tha.t 'Au' 
means not gold but 'author' in the copy-editing world. The copy editor had substituted 
'cleverer' for Don's 'more clever' ,  citing Fowler. Don sighed and recalled the occasion that 
Scientific American had replaced his 'more common' with 'commoner'. It was noticeable 
that the copy editor was not going to change anything without Don's specific approval­
not even removing the first 'of' in ' . . .  several possible of values of the variable n . . . ' .  Don 
told us that at the moment all papers are re-typed by the publishers, except for one or 
two AI journals that have used TEX for several years. But next year a math journa.l will 
be adopting a policy in which the author's text is manipula.ted electronically throughout 
the whole process. This should speed publication and reduce errors and costs. 
Some of the note's in the galley were signed ' Ptr', that is 'printer', and asked 'OK?' .  Don 
answers affirmatively by circling the 'OK'. At one point he was asked to sanction the 
insertion of a whole new sentence. Apparently he had made reference to Figure 14 before 
Figure 13, and his approval was sought to make an extra comment first about 'Figures 
13-16'. (The extra comment was wrong but fixable. )  
The publishers also insisted on  more details in  his bibliography. They wanted to  know, 
for example, exactly where and when a conference had taken place. Someone in the class 
pointed out that Mary-Claire van Leunen recommends omitting the location of conferences. 
Don replied that libraries often nowadays index conferences by city for those poor souls who 
can remember nothing else about them; so such information was useful. He observed that 
people have a great tendency to copy citation information blindly into their own papers, 
and so errors propagate unchecked. When Elwyn Berlekamp wrote his book on coding 
theory, he found that nearly half the information in bibliographies of papers was wrong! 
Don wrapped up the galley proof. discussion by showing us a few tables of (somewhat ) 
standardized proof-readers' symbols. 
§ 14. GALLEY PROOFS I 
§15. Excerpts from class, October 30 [notes by PMRj 
Today Don spoke about the refereeing process. A paper submitted to an academic journal 
is usually passed to one or more referees by the editor of the journal. Each referee is 
intended to be an expert in the relevant field, and thus in a position to tell the edit.or 
whether or not the paper meri ts publication. Don pointed out that many of us will one 
day find our papers being subject to just this scrutiny; and some of us will certainly be 
asked to assess other people's papers ourselves. 
-
Don talked about his now famous research on "The Toilet Paper Problem." This was first 
published in the MONTHLY, and as Don pointed out to the Editor in his cover letter, mRlly 
of its readers probably keep their copies in the bathroom anyway. The editor (HalulOs) 
replied a little gravely that "jokes are dangerous in our journal" , and asked Don to think 
twice about the scatological references. Don did agree to change the section names-which 
originally continued the pun with such headings as 'An absorbing barrier' ,  'A process 
of elimination', and 'Residues'-to innocuous equivalents, but kept the title intact. In 
justification of this, Don pointed out to the editor that two talks had already been given on 
his results under this title, and that the material had been widely circulated and discussed. 
"Your toilet paper is accepted" replied Halmos. Don confessed that he still has occasional 
doubts when he catches sight of the title amongst his papers, but the deed is done now. 
Still, it did get reasonably good reviews, even in Russia. 
Don showed us an article entitled 'Rules for Referees' by Forscher, published in Science 
(October 15 ,  1965). These rules constitute a rather traditional view, Don said, and em­
phasize the legal rights and responsibilities of all concerned. Don thought that this seems 
a lot more oriented to the advancement of careers rather than of science as such; the right 
reason to publish is to build upon the results of others and provide a foundation for fu t.ure 
research. It is a sad truth, said Don, that an editor can all too easily find himself spending 
a great deal of time dealing with those authors whose papers don't merit publicatioll. for 
it is usually very hard to convince them of the fact . Rebuttals are followed by counter­
rebuttals , and so on. But fortunately this doesn't happen so often that the whole business 
of science gets bogged down. 
The referee is conventionally regarded as a sort of "expert witness," whose task is to tell 
the editor whether the paper deserves to be published or not. The first criterion should 
be originality; is the material presented a genuine advance on previous work? 
Don urged referees to see their primary responsibility as being to authors and readers, not 
just to editors. Don himself decided long ago that he would put more of his efforts into 
refereeing papers before their publication than into reviewing published papers. Don hoped 
that he could thus do his bit to encourage high standards of writing in Computer Science 
and help the field win respect . These days there are more good people to go around, both 
in refereeing and reviewing. 
In the 1960's Don circulated a list of 'Hints to referees' to try to encourage good practice. 
He wanted to show us the list, but not a copy can be found. Don has written to some of 
the people to .whom he sent it ,  so it is possible that a copy will turn up before the end of 
the quarter. 
[§ 15 · REFEREEING (1) 
[32 
Don disagreed with our guest speaker, Herb ·'Nilf, who had said that he would tolerate 
more stylistic lapses in the Journal of Algorithms than in the MONTHLY. Authors, thought 
Don, should always be encouraged to do better; he could recall only a single occasion when. 
as a referee or editor, he could recommend no improvements at all. (The author in this 
case was George Collins writing for the ACM journal. )  Let us publish journals to be proud 
of, he said. This was sadly not true of Computer Science in the early 60s. Some published 
results were just plain wrong; or a correct result was incorrectly proved; or a paper simply 
contained no results at all! Contrast this state of affairs, said Don, to the math journals 
that were published in the 20s and 30s-leafing through them at random we see a host 
of familiar names and theorems, because so much of what was written then was polished, 
significant, and worth reprinting in textbooks .  The same could not be said of loday's 
efforts-perhaps we have grown increasingly tolerant of substandard work. 
Referees should try to be teachers, said Don. The author you criticize today will be writing 
another paper tomorrow, so try to help him improve his writing. Unfortunately, referees 
wil l  often be over-critical and make quite tasteless comments on papers, knowing that 
they do so under a cloak of anonymity. This only angers the author and he learns nothing. 
Try to supply constructive criticism, Don urged. These human issues are not discussed in 
Forscher's ' Rules'. 
In addition, the referee can contribute to the technical quality of a paper by giving ref­
erences to related work of which the author was apparently unaware, or improving the 
results. Don himself has contributed results anonymously to papers-more than one au­
thor has had to add a footnote: "My thanks to the referee for Theorems 4, 5, and 6 ."  
Don was always pleased to feel that by doing this the image of the journal was improved. 
A journal should be seen as a source of wisdom, so let us be cooperative toward this end, 
not legalistic. 
How should one choose a journal to which to submit a paper? Don thought the answer is 
to look for the one with the best referees, not the one with the least critical editor. After 
all, an author presumably wants to know whether he has really made a contribution to his 
field. So find a journal that has handled papers on related subjects. 
Someone asked whether the letters that appear in journals are also refereed. Don said 
that sometimes they are, sometimes not. There is often nothing to distinguish letters from 
short papers. 
Some journals do not use referees at all. Their readership must be willing to wade through 
a great deal of nonsense. The ACM did at one time have plans to publish an unrefereed 
journal, but to Don's relief that never came to fruition. 
At this point Don confessed to a sneaky trick he had pulled way back in the 60s. At that 
time he had just begun to edit the programming languages material for the Communica­
tions of the ACM and the Journal of the A CM. He had no way of knowing which of his 
referees were any good, so in an effort to calibrate them he sent all a copy of the same paper 
and solicited their opinions. Don had already refereed the paper himself, of course, and 
found it a very badly written exposition of a very interesting algorithm (due to someone 
besides the author) .  As such, it was certainly worthy of the referees' study. 
§ 15 · REFEREEIt';C ( 1 ) 1  
We looked at some of the results. One commentator simply went through line by line, listing 
his complaints point by point. Another made much more general comments: "A paper 
with this title should contain (1) a complete algorithm; (2)  a proof or at least a convincing 
explanation of corrctness; (3) a statement of limitations on the algorithm's applicability. 
None of these can be found here." A third said that the paper contained little that was 
new, and supplied a substantial bibliography for the author to go away and study. The next 
referee liked the algorithm and recommended the paper for publication. Don was surprised; 
he had mistakenly thought that this referee had originally invented the algorithm himself! 
Another critic dismissed the paper as 'incredibly poorly written'. Another commented it 
was not a paper to be read, but rather a puzzle to be solved. 
Don told us that as a result of his experiment, the algorithm actually became quite well­
known. 
On one occasion Don ripped into a paper with a long report on its failings, and was later 
told by the author that those constructive comments had changed his life: The author had 
resolved that from then on he was going to study writing and give a lot of attention to 
exposition. This nameless individual went on to become a renowned professor at a great 
(but here equally nameless) university, and an editor of a fine journal. 
In answer to a question, Don said that if the content of a paper was obviously bad, he 
would not spend time reviewing the grammar. But in studying a paper that really has 
something to say, then he would also try to ensure that it was said as well as possible. 
Don showed us some referees' reports on one of his recent papers. The editor had told him 
that these were 'mostly positive'-in fact two were in favour and one against .  The referees 
in this case had been asked to answer a specific list of questions about his paper-Don 
said that this tedious format might at least cause a referee to consider issues he might 
otherwise have forgotten about. The referees did agree that Don hadn't made enough 
reference to earlier work in the subject. This didn't surpirse him; the paper was his first 
venture into an unfamiliar field. The referees were helpful enough to comment now and 
then that they had particularly enjoyed certain sections, and they provided a whole slew 
of references to other work-references that Don said had led to some new ideas. They 
were also able to point out subtle technical errors; Don had to write a program to convince 
himself that one in particular of these criticisms was valid. Finally, we were amused to 
see that the referees were asked to assign an overall rating to the paper by checking one 
of a series of boxes, ranging from (as the most fulsome praise) "accept" , down through 
"accept with major modifications" and "accept with minor changes" to "Reject: submit 
to _______ " .  When checking this last box (and most damning indictment) ,  the referee was 
asked to suggest a less prestigious journal that might publish such inferior work. By such a 
downward filtering, even the most appalling paper stands some chance of finding its place 
in the pages of what Dijkstra has characterised a "Write-Only Journal" .  With four new 
scientific papers being published every minute throughout the world, we can rest assured 
that many do so.

§ 16. Excerpts from class, November 2 [notes by TLL] 
Today's handout, "Hints for Referees" by D. Knuth (see § 17 below) ,  could have been 
subtitled "Ask and ye shall receive." Last Friday Don mentioned in class tha t he could 
find no copy of this document, but when he returned to his office immediately after class 
he found it sitting on his desk. (To be truthful, he thinks this copy has gone through a 
few revisions since it left his hands; he no longer recognizes the style of all the comments . )  
Before demonstrating to us how highly he esteems referees and the lengths to which he 
will go in order to get referees, Don told us to note an important date on our calendar: 
On Wednesday, November 18, we are to turn in the first drafts of our Term Papers ( "The 
closer to the final version, the better" ) .  
The identities of the referees for a journal paper are usually hidden from the author. Is 
the identity of the author ever hidden from the referees? In some few journals, yes. Don 
is well aware that the name written just below the title of a paper can strongly effect the 
reader's reaction, so he submitted a journal paper using the sobriquet, Ursula N. Owen. 
(Those of us who have read Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None realize that his 
use of the name U. N. Owen is a pleasant allusion.) 
Don doesn't always resort to pseudonyms, but neither does he always get his papers ref­
ereed. On occasion he has recruited his own referees when he found out that his target 
publication was supplying none. As an example, his paper on Literate Programming for 
the British Computer Journal generated no referee reports (and no feedback of any kind); 
they went right into print. 
Don repeatedly stated how invaluable he found "feedback from a motivated reader." He 
showed us the comments that "Ursula" got on her paper, and they were pertinent in more 
than one way. The referee found typographic errors and suggested notation changes, as 
well as finding errors where there were none present. The last set of comments were more 
important than they might at first seem because they pointed out where Don's presentation 
was misleading or overly subtle. 
In another example, the referee significantly improved one of the theorems while remain­
ing anonymous. Instead of being content with an acknowledgement to an anonymous 
contributer, such a referee could be jealous and publish his own competing paper. 
In contrast to such substantive contributions, Don showed us another example with sug­
gestions that he called "facile generalizations" (terminology attributed to Polya): general­
izations that are merely mechanical manipulations of a given a.rgument without creating 
new insight . 
Don says that refereeing is a "cooperative effort-a correspondence between tens of thou­
sands of world authorities," and he is perfectly willing to exploit the system by letting 
referees improve his papers as he helps with theirs. 
He showed us a series of letters passing between himself and the Journal of Number Theory. 
He had produced a result that seemed novel (could not be found by exploring the standard 
pathways in the Math Library) ,  but since Number Theory is not his field of expertise, Don 
was unwilling to claim that the result was not a duplication. He told this to the editors 
§ 16. REFEREEING (2)] 
of the journal and asked for feedback. ( "I put in a lot of time reviewing other people's 
papers. This is my chance to get some of that time back." ) 
The referee reports on that paper found references that Don "couldn't have found in a 
million years." The results were similar but not identical, so the referee offered to check 
with a famous Russian expert. As Don was availing himself of this offer. someone else was 
publishing on the same subject. ( "You have to decide, do you want speedy publishing or 
rigorous checking?" ) 
Finally, he showed us two examples that dealt with ambiguity. In the first, he and David 
Fuchs had written a paper entitled "Optimal Font Caching." One of the refereees pointed 
out that this paper could be about the caching of optimal fonts, or the best of all possible 
caching mechanisms for fonts. An analogous title "Common Sense Amplifiers" was cited. 
(Don and Dave solved this problem by changing the title to "Optimal Prepaging and Font 
Caching." ) In the second, he had to cope with the IEEE Journal on Coding Theory's 
penchant for writing out the words 'one' and 'zero' for the symbols ' 1 '  and '0'. Since 'one' 
is an English pronoun, he was forced to use the word 'unity' in one place to make the text 
unambiguous.

§ 17 .  HINTS FOR REFERU;s j 
§18. Excerpts from class, November 4 . [notes by PMRJ 
Today, Don said, we are going to talk about the use of pictures and illustrations in math· 
ematical writing, and about the problem of "getting across the feeling of complicated 
algorithms." 
But first, by popular demand, Don showed us his first publication. This was a description 
of a system of weights and measures known as the Potrzebie System, which appeared in 
the pages of MAD magazine in 1957. Any resemblance to the Metric System is purely 
coincidental. It an extremely natural and logical system, Don told us. For example, the 
units of time were named after the editors of MAD (the new editors substituted their 
own names). He felt there was also a need for new units of counting, and so coined the 
MAD; 48 things constitute one MAD (or 49, a baker's MAD). Don didn't publish a better 
illustrated work until The 1EX book, he claimed, nor another paid one until he wrote for 
ACM Computing Surveys some 12 years later. MAD forked over no less than $25 for this 
research paper, no mean sum thirty years ago. 'The Potrzebie System' still heads the list 
of publications on his C.V. 
MAD inexplicably declined Don's second article, "RUNCIBLE: Algorithmic Translation 
on a Limited Computer," which was picked up by Communications of the ACM in 1959. 
Perhaps this was because it contained what even Don admits is probably one of the worst 
" spaghetti" flow charts ever drawn. Not only does the chart attempt to illustrate the 
entire algorithm, but it contains an error (a misdirected arrow) .  The article included 
a play-by-play account of the algorithm, which helped ameliorate the obscurity of the 
chart. Back in those days, Don now admits, he didn't know any better. Likewise, full of 
youthful enthusiasm at being able to communicate improvements on a previously published 
algorithm (Don was a Junior then), he failed to mention his co-authors in the paper; Don 
did the writing but other students contributed illustrations and most of the ideas of the 
algorithm. At the time he had no notion there was academic prestige to be gained through 
publication, Don confessed. This is, he said, a. common mistake among young authors who 
frequently overlook proper acknowledgements in their haste to get the news out. At the 
other extreme, he recalled, Paul Erdos once cited a railroad car porter as a co-author. 
Diagrams are good if they are kept small, said Don. As an example of a useful one that 
is not small, he showed us a fold-out syntax chart for a slightly extended version of the 
Algol 60 language. It does convey quite a good impression of what the language is, and 
gives computer scientists something to hang on the wall where chemists put their Periodic 
Tables. 
Don's "Programming Pearls" article came up again. He had ended that paper with the 
observation that the only fair test of his WEB system would be this: Someone should provide 
a challenge problem, and Don would use WEB to write an ultra-elegant solution to it . .  Jon 
Bentley responded to this challenge; he devised such a problem and invited Don to submit 
his solution for publication. Holding Don to his claim that WEB programs should be works 
of literature, Jon then published the solution along with a literary critique. In this review 
Jon commented that Don could have eased the exposition of his data structure with a 
suitable diagram. Don agreed that this would have helped the reader get a handle on 
it (he had described the data structure in words only) .  He told us that diagrams were 
[§18. ILLUSTRATIONS (1) :1 7 ' 
[38 
actually quite easy to do in WEB, a claim that was greeted with a certain skeptical laughter 
from the class (all doubtless recalling hours spent wasted trying to get tables j",_,t  right ) ,  
Referring again to his 'optimal prepaging' paper (which included a diagram in which t",o 
approximately diagonal lines crawled across the page, touching occasionally to indicate a 
page fault ) Don told us that the referee had complained that the figure was too detailed. 
Don disagreed with this, saying that the detail was there for those who want to see it, but 
could easily be ignored by those who don't. Don confessed that he always has been very 
concerned with the minutia! of his subject, and seldom thought any detail too trifling to 
bother with. 
Don discussed a paper he had written with Michael Plass on T]y\:'s algorithm for placing 
line-breaks in a paragraph [Software--Practice & Experience 1 1  ( 1981 ) , 1 1 19-1 184]. The 
main difficulty writing the paper was: How to describe the problem and the new algorithm? 
First of all, they chose a paragraph from one of Grimm's Fa iry Tales as "test data" with 
which to illustrate the process. As Don remarked once before. it is better to use "real" data 
than "sample data" that have in fact been cooked up solely to use as an example. [Grimm 's 
Fairy Tales, along with the text of Harold and Maude, are kept on-line on SAIL (an ancient 
and eccentric CSD computer).] Corresponding to each line of any right-and-Ieft-justified 
paragraph is a real number, positive or negative, indicating the degree to which the line 
had to be stretched or compressed to fit the space exactly. In his paper, Don prints these 
numbers in a column beside his typeset paragraph. Don used a couple of lines of the paper 
itself to show how bad it looks if these adjustments are too extreme ( and of course had to 
tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they "correct" it) .  
Don outlined three basic algorithms: first fit (which essentially packs the text as tightly as 
possible one line at a time); best fit (which can loosen it up if this works better, but still 
works line by line); and optimum fit (optimal in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the 
"demerits" earned by the various distortions of each line, taken over the paragraph as a 
whole) .  To describe this last algorithm, Don drew a diagram. It is essentially a graph, each 
node on level p corresponding to a different word after which the pth line might be broken. 
Edges run between nodes on successive levels, and are labelled by the demerits scored by 
the line of text they define. The problem of finding an optimal fit thus reduces to finding 
a least-cost path from the top to the bottom node; well-understood search techniques can 
be used for this. Don commented that certain "demerit-cutoffs" were used to limit the 
number of nodes on each level and thus speed the algorithm. This means that a solution 
in which one very distorted line permits all the rest to be displayed perfectly might be 
missed. 
If the above account is opaque, it only goes to show why diagrams can be so useful! 
The article includes histograms to illustrate how frequently 'lEX generates more-or-Iess 
distorted lines of text . As he explained, this was biased by the fact that he would usually 
re-write any particularly ugly paragraph. A second histogram confirmed that the text was 
considerably more distorted when it hadn't been hand-crafted to the line-width that 'lEX 
was generating, yet the new algorithm was significantly better than Brands X and Y .  
Finally, we saw an old Bible whose printers were so keen to fill out the page width that 
§ 18 .  ILLUSTRATIONS { I J ]  
they inserted strings of o's to fill up any gaps. 
Don found many illustrative illustrations in the book The Visual DispJay of Quantatati"e 
Information by Tufte. He also recommended How to Lie with Statistics by Huff, which 
advises (for example) that if you would impress your populace with the dazzling success 
of the Five-Year Plan in increasing wheat production by 17%, then draw two sacks. the 
first 6 cm and the second 7 cm tall. The perceived increase, of course, corresponds to the 
apparent volumes of the sacks, and 73 is 58% larger than 63 . . . .  
Don referred to Terry Winograd's book Language as a Cognitive Process. Algorithms for 
parsing English sentences are there illustrated as charts defining augmented transition net­
works or ATN's-nodes correspond to internal states, edges are transitions between states 
and correspond to individual words. Winograd also has a nice use of nested diagrams­
boxes within boxes-to replace the more traditional tree diagrams. 
We saw a scattergram of smiley-faces of somewhat indeterminate significance; a wit in 
SrTN projected Don's amongst them. The idea is that several dimensions of numeric 
data can be used to control features on these faces; humans are supposedly wired to read 
nuances in facial expressions quite easily. 
Don showed us a table from his Art of Computer Programming that listed the many, 
many states of the Caltech elevator. He said he wished that he'd been able to dream up a 
diagram to capture that example more neatly: A listing of events is the best way he knows 
to convey the essential features of asynchonous processes. 
The third Volume of this tome does contain a large fold-out illustration comparing the 
performances of various sort-on-tapes algorithms. Certain subtleties arise from overlaps, 
rewinds, and buffering that tend to elude conventional algorithmic analysis. Don's diagram 
neatly captures these, and clearly shows that certain sophisticated algorithms-one was 
even patented by its author-are in fact slower than traditional methods. Unanticipated 
rewind times can cause significant slow-downs, and the chart shows why.

3 19. Excerpts from class, November 6 .  [notes by TLL] 
We spent the first half of class examining the solutions to a homework assignment (see 320 
below). Don says that the solutions were surprisingly good (see § 2 1 ) . 
One of the proofs described in that section contains illustrations in four colors. Don says 
that color can be used effectively in talks, but usually not in papers (for that matter. 
Leslie Lamport says that proofs should never be presented in talks, but only in papers ) .  
Technical illustrations, even without four colors, cause no end of trouble: Don says that 
the amount of work involved in preparing a paper for publication is proportional to the 
cube of the number of illustrations. But they are indispensible in many cases. 
Don showed us several of the illustrations, charts, and tables from The Art of Compu ter 
Programming, Volume 3, and recounted the difficulties in choosing clear methods of pre­
senting his ideas. He also mentioned some technical and artistic problems that he had with 
an illustration: At what angle should the truncated octahedron on page 13 be displayed? 
His books contain some numerical tables ( "which are sometimes thought to be unenlight­
ening" ) ;  Don says that they can sometimes present ideas that can't be demonstrated 
graphically (such as numbers oscillating about 2 with period 211" , page 41) .  Diagrams with 
accompanying text are also used. Don made sure that the final text was arranged opposite 
the diagrams to which it refers. 
The book contains a running example of how 16 particular numbers are sorted by dozens 
of different algorithms. Each algorithm leads to a different graphical presentation of the 
sorting activities on those numbers (pages 77, 82, 84, 97, 98, 106, 1 10, 1 13, 1 15, 124. 140, 
143, 147, 151,  161, 165, 166, 172, 175, 205, 251, 253, 254, 359). 
320. A Homework Problem 
The Appendix to Gillman's book takes a paper that has horrible notation and simplifies 
it greatly. Your assignment is to take Gillman's simplification and produce something 
simpler yet . Aim for notation that needs no double subscripts or subscripted superscripts. 
This assignment will be graded! Please take time to do your best. 
Here is a statement of Gillman's simplification. This is your starting point. What is the 
best way to present Sierpinski's theorem? 
Lemma. There is a one- te-one correspondence between the set of all real numbers Ii and 
the set of all pairs ( (nk) ,  (tk)) ,  where (nk)k;?:l is an increasing sequence of positive integers 
and (tkh?:l is a sequence of real numbers. 
Notation. The sequences (nk) and (tk) corresponding to Ii are called (nk) and (tk ") .  
The set of real numbers is called R. 
§ 20 .  HOMEWORK: SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRIPTS ] 
Theorem. Assume that (Aa)"ER is a family of countably infini te subsets of R such that. 
for a 'I f3, either a E Ail or f3 E A" . Then there is a sequence of functions In : R --> R 
such that, if 5 is any uncountable subset of R, we have In(5 )  = R for all but finitely 
man.v In .  
Proof. Let the countable set A" consist of the real numbers 
--
If a is any real number, define an increasing sequence of positive integers (In by letting 
If = nr1 and then, after l�_l has been defined, letting I� be the least integer in the 
sequence (nr' , n�· , . . .  ) that is greater than I�-l ' 
Let In be the function on real numbers defined by the rule 
{ ta. In(a) = n ' 
0 ,  
if n = l� for some k � 1 ;  
otherwise. 
We will show that the sequence of functions In satisfies the theorem, by proving that any 
set 5 for which infinitely many n have In (5) 'I R must be countable. 
Suppose, therefore, that (nk) is an increasing sequence of integers and that (tk) is a 
sequence of real numbers such that 
for all k � 1 .  
Let tj = 0 if j is not one of the numbers {nl , n2 , " . } . By the lemma, there's a real 
number f3 such that nk = n� and tk = t� for all k .  
Let 0 be any real number 'I f3 such that a tf. Ail ' We will prove that Q tf. 
'
5; this will 
prove the theorem, because all elements of 5 must then lie in the countable set Ail U {f3} .  
By hypothesis, f3 E A" . Hence we have f3 = Ok for some k .  If we set n = l� , we know by

[Here are additional excerpts from TLL's classnotes for October 16, when the homework 
problem was handed out:] The first thing that we learned in class today was that now 
would be a good time to buy Leonard Gillman's book ( Writing Mathematics Well) .  :>iot 
only have several copies (finally) arrived at the bookstore, but Don has given us a homework 
assignment straight out of the Appendix of this book. 
The assignment (which is due on Friday, October 30th) is to take the "simplified version" 
of the proof in Gillman's case study and to simplify it still further. The main simplifying 
principle is to minimize subscripts and superscripts. When we are done, there should be 
no subscripted subscripts and no subscripted superscripts. As Don said, "Try to recast 
the proof so that the idea of the proof remains the same, but the proof gets shorter." 
The original proof was written by Sierpinski. Don told us that Sierpinski was a great 
mathematician who wrote several papers cited in Concrete Mathematics, from the year 
1909 as well as 1959. But the notation in Sierpinski's original proof quoted by Gillman 
was so complicated that it confused even him: His proof contained an error that was found 
by another mathematician (after publication) .  
While the mathematics used in the proof is  not trivial, it uses only functions and sets and 
should be accessible to us. (This is not to say that it is immediately obvious.)  Anyone who 
is uncomfortable with what sets 
'
are, what it means for a set to be countable, or what a one­
to-one correspondence is, may need some help with this assignment. Don recommended 
visiting the TAs during office hours as a good first step for those who feel they need help. 
(It might also help to remember that Don says, "It's not necessary to understand the proof 
completely in order to do this assignment." )  
Don't worry if  the hypothesis of the theorem seems pretty wild; i t  is pretty wild. I t  implies 
the "Continuum Hypothesis." The Continuum Hypothesis states that there are no infini­
ties between the countably infinite (the cardinality of the integers) and the continuum (the 
cardinality of the real numbers). From 1900-1960, the truth or falsity of the Continuum 
Hypothesis was one of the most famous unsolved problems of mathematics; Siepinski pub­
lished his paper as a step toward solving that problem. Paul Cohen, a Stanford professor, 
eventually showed that both the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation are consistent 
with standard set theory; so the hypothesis can be neither proved nor disproved. 
[Here are additional excerpts from PMR's classnotes for October 23:] The homework 
assignment is due a week from today, Don said; so do it as well as possible, and let's not 
have any excuses! 
320.  HOMEWORK: SUBSCRIPTS AND SUPERSCRfP'l, 
§:n . Solutions to  the Homework Assignment 
Most students pleased the instructor by handling this rather well. Either you already knew 
a lot about writing, or you have learned something this quarter; in any case the exerrise 
seems to have been good practice. 
Several answers or excerpts from answers are attached. First is Solution A, an unexplll'­
gated draft that was written by your instructor before handing out the assignment. The 
main idea here is to "hold back" before enumerating the elements of a set; YOll can say that 
S is countable without writing S = { S I , S2 , " ' } ' This solution also simplifies Sierpinski's 
proof in minor ways. For example, it's not necessary to have the hypothesis C/ f. .8 to 
conclude that C/ E -4.il or f3 E A" , because the existence of a family .-I." that satisfies 
Sierpinski's more complicated hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of a family that 
satisfies the simplified one. 
The grader objected to the last sentence in the first paragraph of my proof. He asks, "Has 
some 'initialization' of L" been omitted?" He apparently wants k = 1 to be singled out as 
a special case, for more effective exposition. The sentence makes perfectly good sense to 
me, but maybe there should be a concession to readers who are unaccustomed to empty 
constraints. 
Solution B introduces two nice techniques of a different kind. First, the lemma becomes 
a sequence of ordered pairs instead of an ordered pair of sequences. Second, the need for 
a notational correspondence between Q and the corresponding sequence is avoided by just 
using English words, saying that one is the counterpart of the other. In other words. we 
can hold back in giving notations for a correspondence, since plain words are sufficient 
(even bet ter at times). 
Solution B also "factors" the proof into two parts, one that describes a subgoal ( the crucial 
property that the functions fn will possess) and one that applies the coup de grace. Much 
less must be kept in mind when you read a factored proof, because the two pieces have a 
simple interface. Moreover, the reader is told that the proof is "essentially a diagonalization 
technique" ;  this gives an extremely helpful orientation. It is no wonder that the grader 
found Solution B easier to understand than Solution A. 
Solution C i s  by another student who found words superior to notation in this case. 
Solution D cannot be shown in full because it contains seven illustrations, some of which 
are in four colors. But the excerpts that are shown do capture its expository flavor. 
A combination of the ideas from all these solutions would lead to a truly perspicacIOUS 
proof of Sierpinski's theorem. 
[§21 .  HOMEWORK: SOLUTIONS OJ 
[44 
Solution A 
Lemma. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all real numbers a and 
the set of all pairs (N, T) , where N is a countable set of integers and T is a sequence of 
real numbers. 
Notation. The set N corresponding to 0 is called N"" and the sequence T is called 
(a I ,  a2, . . . ) .  The set of real numbers is called R. 
Theorem. Assume that there is an uncountable family of countable subsets ..1."" one for 
each real number o . with the property that either 0 E Ai! or f3 E A", for all real a and (3 .  
Then there exists a countable family F of functions i : R ..... R such that, if 5 IS any 
uncountable subset of R, we have i(5) = R for all but finitely many i E F. 
Proof. If a is any real number, we can construct a countable set of integers L", as follows: 
For k = 1 , 2, . . . , let f3 be the ph element of A"" in some enumeration of this countable 
set. Include in L", any element of Ni! that's not already present in L", because of the first 
k - 1 elements of A", . 
Now let F = {h ,  12 ,  . . .  } be the countable set of functions defined for all real a as follows: 
in(o) = { f3n , 0 , if n E L", and n corresponds to f3 E .4" ; if n ¢ L", . 
We will show that F satisfies the theorem, by proving that any given set 5 � R is countable 
whenever { n  I in(5) # R }  is infinite. 
Let 5 be a set such that N = { n  I in(5) # R }  is infinite, and suppose that 
for all n E N . 
Let tn = 0 for n ¢ N .  By the lemma, there is a real number f3 such that N = N{3 and 
( t 1 , t2 ,  . . .  ) = (f31 , f32 ,  . . .  ) .  
Let a be  any real number such that 0 ¢ Ai! ' We will prove that a ¢ 5;  this will prove 
the theorem, because all elements of 5 then must lie in the countable set Ai! ' 
By hypothesis, f3 E A", . Hence there is some n E L" corresponding to f3 ,  and in(a) = f3n 
by definition of in . Also n E Np = N ,  by the construction of L". But f3n = tn ¢ in (5) ,  
so a cannot be in 5 . I

Solution B 
Sierpinski's Theorem 
Lemma. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all real numbers Q and 
the set of all sequences of ordered pairs ((n" t ' ) ) '> I , where the first component (n,) is an 
increasing sequence of positive integers and the second component (t,) is a sequence of 
real numbers. 
We shall call the sequence of ordered pairs corresponding to Q the counterpart of Q ,  and 
vice versa. 
Theorem. Suppose that there exists a family of countably infinite subsets of the reals R. 
denoted by (A")"ER, with the property that Q "I {3 implies either Q E .4.11 or {3 E .-I." . 
Then there is a sequence of functions In : R -t R such that for any uncountable subset 5 
of R, we have In (S) = R for all but finitely many In . 
Proof: Using the existence of (Aa)aER,  we first construct a sequence of functions In with 
the property that for all 0 ,  and for all {3 E Aa , there exists an ordered pair (n,  t) in the 
counterpart of {3 such that In(o) = t .  The construction is essentially a diagonalization 
technique. For each 0 ,  let the countable set A" be enumerated as 
Start with (nl ,  t l )  being the first ordered pair in the counterpart of {31 ' Proceed inductively, 
and let (n. , t k )  be the first ordered pair in the counterpart of {3. such that n. > n'_I . This 
selection can be made because the first component of the counterpart of {3. is unbounded. 
Thus, we have constructed a sequence of ordered pairs ((n.,  tk))'�1 with n. increasing and 
each (n. , t . )  in the counterpart of {3 • .  Using this sequence, we then define the function In 
by the rule 
if n = n. for some k;  
otherwise. 
Indeed, In is well-defined since ni "I nj for i "I j .  Moreover, the sequence (In) has the 
desired property that for every 0 and every {3 in A", there is an ordered pair (n, t )  in the 
counterpart of {3 such that In(o) = t .  
Now we show that any subset S of R for which infinitely many n have In(S) "I R must be 
countable, thereby proving the theorem. If In(S)  "I R then there exists a real t ¢ In( S ) .  
So  if there are infinitely many In such that In( S) "I R, then there is a sequence of ordered 
pairs (n, t)  with n increasing and t ¢ In(S ) .  Let the counterpart of this sequence of 
ordered pairs be {3 .  Thus, every ordered pair (n, t) in the counterpart of {3 has t ¢ In(S) .  
Now consider all real 0 ¢ All U {{3} . By the hypothesis, we must have {3 E Aa . We 
constructed the sequence (In) in such a way that there is an ordered pair (n, t)  in the 
counterpart of {3 with In(o) = t .  But by the choice of {3 ,  we have t ¢ In(S).  Hence, 
In (o) = t ¢ In(S)  implies 0 ¢ S .  Therefore S must be a subset of All U {{3} , a cOl.\ntable 
set, implying that S is also a countable set. 
[§21 .  HOMEWORK: SOLUTIONS 45 )  
[46 
Solution C 
. . .  If the real number a corresponds to the pair ((nk) , ( tk ) ) ,  then we call (nkk2:1 the 
integer sequence of Q and (tkh2:1 the real Jequence of a . 
. . . Proof. Note that a given real number a has associated with it both integer and 
real sequences, as well as a set of reals A", = {aI ,  a2,  a3 , . . .  } .  We add to this list and 
construct an infinite set of integers La = { II , 12 , 13 ,  . . .  } in which each I; comes from the 
integer sequence of a i . 
if n = I; E La,  where (tk)  is the real sequence of a; ;  
otherwise. 
With these functions we will establish the contrapositive of the theorem: If jn (S) of R for 
infinitely many integers n ,  then S is countable . . . .  
Solution D 
As a step toward proving the Continuum Hypothesis, which states that there are no infini­
ties between the countably infinite and the continuum, Sierpinski proposed the following 
theorem. 
Suppose we have a function, special , that maps every real a to a count ably infinite subset 
of the reals (Figure A). Now suppose we make the additional hypothesis that for any two 
reals Q of a, either a E special or a E special (Figure B).  Then we can dra.w the following 
conclusion. There exists . . .

Quotation . . .  a writer expresses himself in quoting words that have been used 
before because they give his meaning better than he can give it himself, or because 
they are beautiful or witty, or because he expects them to touch a chord of 
association in his readers, or because he wishes to show that he is learned and 
well-read. Quotation due to the last motive is invariably ill-advised; the discerning 
reader detects it and is contemptuous, the undiscerning is perhaps impressed, but 
even then is at the same time repelled, pretentious quotation being the surest road 
to tedium.

Don's secret delight, he confessed today, is to "play a library as if it were a musical instru­
ment." Using the resources of a great library to solve a specific problem-now that, to him, 
is real living. One of his favourite ways to spend an afternoon is amongst the labyrinthine 
archives, pursing obscure cross-references, tracking down ancient and neglected volumes, 
all in the hope of finding the perfect quotation with which to open or conclude a chapter . 
Don takes great pleasure in finding a really good aphorism with which to preface a piece 
of writing. So many people have written so many neat things down the ages, he said, that 
it behooves us to take every opportunity to pass them on. Don has been known to take 
such a liking to a phrase that he has written an article to publish along with it . 
So how are to find that wonderfully apposite quotation with which to preface our term 
paper? Serendipity, said Don. Live a full and varied life, read widely, keep your eyes and 
ears open, live long and prosper. You will stumble across great quotations. For example, 
vVebster defines 'bit' as "a boring tool"-Don was able to use this when introducing a 
computer science talk. 
Sometimes one needs to go about the search more systematically. For example, Don's 
TEXbook consists of 27 chapters, 10 appendices, and a preface. His format demands two 
relevant quotations at the end of each of these. His METAFONT book posed exactly the 
same problem. How did he go about it? 
The first secret, he confided, is Bartlett .  There are numerous dictionaries of quotations 
[filed under PN 6000 in the reference section of Green Library], of which B artlett's Familiar 
Quotations is the most familiar. It was here, under the heading 'technique' in the index, 
that Don found a quote from Leonard Bacon deriding Technique as the death of true Art. 
[§ 22 .  QUOTATTONS 4 7) 
:-.Iuw ' TEX ' ,  in greek, means both 'technique' and 'art ' ,  so this seemed pretty appropriate 
for The TE;.X book where the (greek) name TEX is explained. 
When Bartlett fails, we can try the OED. This incomparable dictionary lists every word 
along with contexts in which it has been used; very often it prints a memorable quotation 
that incorporates the word in question. Likewise, we can turn to concordances of Shake­
speare or Chaucer to find every single instance in which these authors used any given 
word. 
Leafing through The TEX book, Don picked out some of his favourites: Goethe on mathe­
maticians (and why they are like Frenchmen); Paul Halmos telling us that the best notation 
is no notation (write mathematics as you would speak it !) .  Tacitus had something to say 
about the macro (or rather, about the ancient politician of that name). 
A stiffer challenge was provided by a book that listed the M ETAFONT code defining each 
letter of the alphabet (as well as other symbols) in a certain typeface; Don had to come 
up with quotes for individual letters of the alphabet. No problem: James Thurber had 
proposed the abolition of '0'; Ambrose Bierce had scathing things to say about 'M' in 
his famous Devil's Dictionary; Benjamin Franklin once wrote to Bodoni concerning the 
exact form of the letter 'T'; a technical report about statistical properties of the alphabet 
deliberately made no use of the letter 'E' .  
Some of the best quotations are taken entirely out of context. The economist Leontief had 
something to say about (economic) output; Don quoted him in his chapter on (computer) 
output. Galsworthy's comments on Expressionists found their way into his section on 
expressIOns. 
In a pinch, said Don, quote yourself. You could even find someone famous and ask her to 
say something-anything!-on such-and-such a subject. In another desperate case, Don 
couldn't find anything much that had been said about fonts. No matter, he quoted the 
explorer Pedro Font writing about something else entirely (the discovery of Palo Alto, as it 
happens) .  If you are Don Knuth, you may even be able to quote Mary-Claire van Leunen 
praising your use of quotation! 
Computer technology now gives us another quote-locating resource. When Albert Camus' 
The Plague is available online, it will be a simple matter for this note-taker to find the 
part in which a writer agonizes for a week before putting a comma in a particular sentence. 
and then for another week before taking it out again; just search for occurrences of the 
word 'comma' in the text. Don used this technique to find quotations involving the word 
'expression' in Grimm 's Fairy Tales and Wutbering Heigbts, both of which are available 
on SAIL. 
If any member of the class would like to demonstrate virtuosity at "playing the library." 
he could try to track down the quotation "God is in the details." Don rather identifies 
with God in this, but hasn't been able to track down the reference. A number of people 
have assured him that it originated with Mies van der Rohe, but despite reading all the 
works and contacting the two biographers of this architect, he has not been able to find it. 
Someone told him that Flaubert once wrote "Le bon Dieu est dans Ie detail." Don hasn't 
the patience t"o search exhaustively in Flaubert '5 voluminous publications, but he did try 
§22 .  QUOTATIO.\ 'i : 
French equivalents of Bartlett-finding the two quotes above (which express the opposite 
sentiment) .  The God-in-details aphorism remains an orphan to this day. 
Don has found another quote that so well expresses his philosophy on the subject of error 
that he is having it carved in slate by English stonecutters, to occupy pride of place in his 
garden: 
The road to wisdom? Well it's plain 
and simple to express: 
err 
and err 
and err again 
but less 
and less 
and less. 
Mention was also made of indexes for books. The Sears & Roebuck catalogue for 189, 
contains the useful advice: "If you don't find it  in the index, look very carefully through 
the entire catalogue." A British judge named Lord Campbell wanted legislation to compel 
writers to index their work (but was never able to get round to it himself). 
Tangentially, Don mentioned that the designers had given his TEXbook rather large para­
graph indentations-perhaps it's the style of the 80s, he said. This meant that he some­
times had to add or subtract words to ensure that the last line of each paragraph was at 
least as long as the indentation on the following one. The page looks rather strange if this 
isn't the case. 
323. Excerpts from class, November 11  [notes by  TLL] 
Today we heard war stories-stories of the wars between Don Knuth and the Scientific 
American editorial staff. 
However, before we got completely on track, Don told us a little about the the book he is 
writing this quarter: Concrete Math. 
He said that this summer he went to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and was 
very impressed. ( "Who would have conceived, in 1937, that such a work of art could be 
made?" )  He said he was inspired; that he wanted to produce a work of art as inspired as 
Snow White, "except that I wanted to finish it in three months." 
A book in three months: This means that Don has to "crank out" four pages a day, 
including Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays. Surprisingly, Don says, "Here it is November, 
and I am still happy." He says sometimes he gets up in the morning and can't wait to get 
writing; at other times he just finds it a chore that he has to do; "but once I get started, 
it's easy-starting is the hard part." 
At this point he delivered the punch line to his story on inspiration: We have one more 
week to finish the first draft of our term papers. We have the good fortune to have two 
professional editors who have volunteered to read our papers: Mary-Claire van Leunen 
and Rosalie Stemer. 
[§23. SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SAGA (1) 4.? ] 
[50 
;"Ioving immediately from his statement that we were lucky to have professionals editing 
our work to the stories of his wars with a professional editor, Don showed us a quotation 
from The Plague, by Camus [found by PMRj . 
"What I really want, doctor, is this. On the day when the manuscript reaches 
the publisher, I want him to stand up-after he's read it through, of course-and 
say to his staff: 'Gentlemen, hats off! ' " 
Of course, the fictional character who made the above statement is portrayed by Camus 
as being not only naive but a bit mentally unstable. This doesn't mean that a person 
couldn't harbor a healthy enmity for an overzealous copy editor. 
Vve now review the correspondence concerning one paper that Don eventually had puh­
Ii shed in Scientific American (henceforth known as SA): 
In the Fall of 1975, Don received a letter from Dennis Flanagan (the editor) .  The letter 
invited him to write a paper, of about 6000 words, on the topic of Algorithms, for SA's 
600,000 readers. It offered him a $500 honorarium for such a paper. (This means he got 
about eight cents per word or eight cents per 100 readers-depending on how you like to 
think of such things . )  
After some correspondence concerning the date that the paper was to be received ( Don 
had been ill and the date needed to be pushed back), we came to the cover letter for the 
original manuscript that Don submitted to SA. He told Mr. Flanagan that he understood 
that some editing would take place, but that he had gone out of his way to try to imitate 
the "Scientific .4.merican style." Don told them, "It will be interesting to see what you do 
to this, my masterpiece." 
Don soon got a letter back from Mr. Flanagan acknowledging Don's paper, telling him 
that it might have to be "slightly edited," and warning him that it might take a while to 
give it the attention it deserves. (Don also got his $500 at this point. )  
Finally, 14  months later, Don received an edited copy of his paper together with a cover 
let ter that explained that it had been "edi ted for the general reader." Don was told to 
correct any errors that they might have inadvertently introduced and exhorted to get back 
to them within the next two weeks. 
To put it mildly, Don was not pleased with the results of this editing. Every sentence 
had been rewritten. He wrote a letter to Martin Gardner-a letter written more to vent 
frustration than in expectation of achieving any result-in which he stated many of his 
grievances. One of his comments covers the general tone: "I was astonished to see how 
many editorial changes were made that took perfectly good English and turned it into 
something that would be worth no more than B - on a high school term paper." 
In addition to showing us his letter to Gardner (and Mr. Gardner's sympathetic response) 
he showed the class the original and the edited versions. Among SA's changes: Changing 
all uses of 'we', transforming some long sentences to several short sentences, transform­
ing some short sentences into one long sentence, removing commas (commas that Don 
found necessary),  changing 'which's to 'that's, removing technical jargon, changing 'most 
common' to 'commonest', and introducing a few errors. ( Don found many of the changes 
§23. SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SA(;A ( I ; : 
gratuitous, but the editorial introduction of errors was useful because it meant that Don's 
exposition had not been clear enough.) 
The next letter we saw was the cover letter for the, now re-edited, manuscript that Don sent 
back to Dennis Flanagan. He mentioned his extensive re-editing, stated that he appreciated 
some aspects of the editing more than some others, and asked to see the galley proofs : he 
said viewing the proofs was especially important since there is "so much technical material 
that is typographical in nature." 
Two weeks later Don got back the proofs and a letter. The letter argued successfully with 
some of Don's objections to the original editing job (they stuck by 'that' instead of 'which'. 
hurray!) ;  less successfully, SA refused to budge on 'commonest'  (boo). The letter also said 
that sending proofs to an author was unprecedented. But the printer was having a terri ble 
time with the mathematics, so they made an exception. (Don pointed out that this was 
largely dictated by the printing mechanisms they were using.) But it was a good thing 
the proofs were sent, because important changes were made during a 1 .5-hour telephone 
conversation. 
By the end of class, about the time that Don showed us his second letter to Martin 
Gardner-the one in which he said he shouldn't have been so frustrated in the first place­
Don admitted that some of the disputed changes really had been appropriate ones. He said 
that the original copy editor had improved his article in some ways, but that his further 
editing had improved it still further. At the end everybody was happy. (Music up.) 
As a final parenthetical remark, he told us about the way that the (quite long) captions 
for illustrations in SA are typeset: The linebreaks are determined by hand. The final 
line always ends at the right margin (there'S no extra white space). To achieve this, the 
SA copy editors must count letters and reword the captions until they fit. One of the 
methods that they use to make things fit nicely is to start at the end of the caption and 
start removing 'the's. ( "It is not placed at root of tree because it is too far from center of 
alphabet ." ) At least, this was the system in 1977. 
Among comments about how the SA editorial staff is overworked and how he shouldn't 
have been so upset, he did get off a parting shot: "After spending all this time doing 
crazy stuff like caption filling, it's no wonder the copy editor had no time for polishing my 
article."

On March 25, Don received the page proofs for his article, which was to appear in the 
April edition. ( "Ever since Martin Gardner's famous April Fool hoax, I had wanted to get 
into an April issue," he mused.)  Don picked up the phone and spent the next hour and a 
half in damage-limitation negotiations with an editor code-named TEB. 
[§24. SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SAGA (2) 51 ] 
[52 
Some straightforward errors were easily corrected: A ' 1 '  had metamorphosed into an ' 1 '  
and an '0' into a ' <p ' .  Typesetters who are unfamiliar with mathematics in"ariably find 
creative things do to with this "empty set" symbol, Don said. Many problems show up 
only at the page-proof stage. For example, one page began with the solitary last line of a 
paragraph and then broke with a new subheading. Since the paragraph could just as easily 
introduce the new subsection as conclude the previous one, Don just moved the subheading 
back to precede it, on the previous page. Don also got his fioor brackets restored where 
square brackets appeared on the page proof. 
Don didn't get his way on everything, though. Brackets were used interchangeably with 
parentheses in a mathematical formula, despite Don's protest that the former have special 
meamngs. 
Neither was Scientific American ( 'SA', hereinafter) able to get hold of a photograph of 
a particular Mesopotamian clay tablet that is housed in the Louvre. It is a table of 
reciprocals, and is probably the earliest example of a large database that was sorted into 
order for ease of retrieval. Don thinks this object definitely deserves a place in the hearts 
and minds of CS folk, being perhaps the first ever significant piece of data processing. 
Even a modern computer might need a second or so to do the work involved. 
On the whole, Don was pretty happy with his article. It enjoys a continuing success 
as an SA reprint; thousands of copies are still sold to schools (with the page references 
carefully renumbered). As far as Don knows, it's the only one of his articles to have been 
translated into Farsi (Persian).  He showed us that in this language, as in others where 
the text runs right to left across the page, mathematical formulre are not reversed. The 
word 'hashing' invariably gives translators pause; it becomes 14 characters in Chinese, and 
a French translator of one of his books once put in a call to the Academie Fran<;aise to 
establish the authorized equivalent. 
All the re-editing was painful at the time, admits Don, but in the long run he has come 
to agree that this cooperative effort did much to remqve the jargon and make the paper 
accessible to a general audience. Martin Gardner, Don told us, attributes his success as a 
mathematics writer to the fact that he is not a mathematician. 
Don's paper for the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory makes for a sadder tale: 
They made such a mess of it that Don decided the game just not worth the candle, and he 
advises everyone to read the Stanford CSD Report instead. For example, IEEE says 'zero' 
and 'one' instead of '0' and ' 1 ' .  Don likes to use 'lg' to mean 'log to the base 2', but they 
changed this without explanation to 'log' despite the fact that to most people this latter 
means 'log to the base 10'; or to number theorists, when it means the natura.l log (base e ) . 
Not the greatest copy-editors, Don sighed. 
More recently, Don wrote for the October issue of the ACM Transactions on Graphics, 
and encountered some really shocking copy-editing. They changed ' . . .  data has to . . .  ' to 
' . . .  data have to . . .  ' .  Now long ago Don was told that 'data' is really plural, but everywhere 
it is used both as a singular or a plural, even in the reliably conservative ( ,antediluvian" 
chimed Mary-Claire) New York Times. Don thought it quite right to use it as a singular 
when referring to data as some kind of collective stuff. Don wrote and complained that 
§24 .  SCIENTIFIC A MERICAN S.�GA (2)1 
the ACM should certainly know about data. In the end, Don kept everyone happy by 
changing the sentence to read ' . . .  data must . . .  ' .  
Mary-Claire van Leunen sanctioned the term ' Automata Theory' ,  although one would not 
normally incorporate a plural adjective into a compound noun. But no-one has ever said 
'automaton theory', and no-one ever will. 
ACM did gracefully admit to and correct some straightforward mistakes, such as 'this 
number plus that number are equal to 63'. But where Don wrote 1000000 they substituted 
1 , 000, 000. Don objected that although this might be justified in text, his use is perfectly 
OK in a formula. Well then, they replied, write 106 .  Fine, said, Don, but what do I do 
when the number is 1234567? The IEEE standard here is to insert spaces, thus: 1 234 567 . 
Don doesn't like this in formulre, but agrees that it may be useful in a high-precision 
context, such as numerical tables. 
Don recalled a remark by George Forsythe that every scientist should try to write for a 
general audience--not just for other scientists-at least once in his life. Don has done 
this three times now, so feels that he's done his bit! He gave his first such lecture to a 
non-technical audience in Norway and found it surprisingly hard to understand their 'mind 
set'. The problem is to make the talk interesting, but convey how it feels to a computer 
scientist to do computer science. The public probably imagine that mathematicians sit 
and factor polynomials all day, and that CS types design videogames. How to convey the 
soul of the subject to them? In this lecture, Don presented a sequence of algorithms for 
a search task. Since we all have to look up information in large tables or indexes now 
and then, he hoped the audience would have a clear intuition of the problem. Brute force 
searching is clearly too slow; binary search is natural and powerful; hashing is better still , 
but very unintuitive to most people. Don was asked to write up his talk for a Norwegian 
magazine called Forskningsnytt ,  'Research News' ( a  sort of Scientiiic Norwegian). In the 
course of doing so he learned enough of the language to wri te v and h instead of I and ,. to 
designate left and right sons in a tree structure. Dr. Ole Amble, a numerical analyst who 
was one of Norway's computer pioneers, helped Don with Norwegian style on this article, 
and got interested in search algorithms as a result. He asked Don whether there mightn't 
be a way to combine the advantages of binary search and hashing? Don at first told him 
"obviously not," but then realized what Amble meant . . .  alas, too late to include in the 
just-published Volume 3 of ACP. But this combination of methods made a nice conclusion 
to his SA paper, which was based on this Norwegian prototype. 
It was in April of 1977 that Don's travails with SA prompted him to investigate typesetting 
for himself; in May of that year he designed the first draft of '!EX and spent his sabbatical 
(and ten more years) perfecting it, putting Volume 4 of ACP on the backburner. 
We had a few minutes left to look at other changes that SA made to Don's original 
manuscript. In the first case we looked at, there seemed to be no reason for restructuring 
a sentence to put Amble's name first instead of the motivation of his discovery. But Mary­
Claire noted that SA always tries to stress the human contributions in science, sometimes 
at the expense of the ideas. Don also mentioned another surprising thing he learned about 
SA's editorial policy: They never display equations. (PMR knows at least one scientist who 
refuses to read SA for this very reason-'How can you explain science without equations?-

Pah l ' ) 
§:l5. Excerpts from class, November 1 6  (notes by TLL] 
After a brief (but charming) musical prelude, Don demonstrated to us that we are not alone 
in being concerned with the mechanics of writing. He showed us four small publications 
that touched on some of the humorous aspects of written rhetoric. 
We briefly viewed a Russell Baker column entitled "Block That That Cursor" ; a "Peanuts" 
comic strip with a punchline concerning comma placement; a. quotation from the Nelv York 
Times ( "Plagiarize creatively, but quotes can be dangerous if you don't acknowledge the 
source" ) ;  and an article by Richard Feynman in the Caltech Alumni magazine. Feynman 
discussed his disappointment with his experience of serving on the Challenger Disaster 
Panel; he complained that instead of discussing ideas, the panel spent all their time " word­
smithing" (deciding how to reword or re-punctuate sentences in the committee's report ) .  
Feynman's dismay at the amount of time he spent dealing with commas, wicked-whiches, 
and typographic presentation is not unique. Don said, "Word-smithing is a much greater 
percentage of what I am supposed to be doing in my life than I would have ever thought. 
That's one of the main reasons I am teaching this course." 
Don also showed us what he thinks is a wonderful piece of writing: a spoof on the Sam 
Spade genre, full of detectives, blondes, .38's, and the 'sweet smell of greenbacks' .  It turned 
out to be a passage from "Getting Even" by Woody Allen. Likewise for the term papers, 
he said, try to have a genre in mind (though perhaps not this one) and do a good job in 
that genre. 
To help prepare us for the guest speakers coming up soon, Don handed out copies of several 
of their works, encouraging us to read them as examples of good practice. First he handed 
out an "Editor's Corner" article published by Herb Wilf last January: 
This issue marks another changing-of-the-guard for the MONTHLY. Paul Halmos' act 
will be a tough one to follow . . .  
Wilf's article contains a nice exposition of problems related to Riemann's famous unproved 
Hypothesis. 
Don also showed us another draft of a paper by Herb: "n coins in a fountain" . This title. 
he said, was just too good to pass up, even though it includes a formula. But Don would 
have capitalized the n instead of putting it in italics. As for the objection about starting 
a title with a symbol, why shouldn't we regard N as simply another English word (after 
all, it appears in most dictionaries as the first entry under 'N')? The paper, however, was 
never published. Delving more deeply into the subject, Herb found that it had all been 
done before. C'est la guerre. 
The next guest speaker after Wilf will be Jeff Ullman, who will tell us how to become rich 
by writing textbooks. Don recommended that we look closely at Chapter 11  of Jeff's book 
Principles of Database Systems (second edition), which shows "excellent simplification of 
subtle problems and algorithms." 
§25. EXAMPLES OF GOOD STH£i 
Don handed out two examples by the third guest speaker Leslie Lamport. One. frotH 
Notices of the American Mathematical Society 34 (June 1987) is entitled "Document 
Production: Visual or Logical?" and Don said "It's a 'flame' but very well written so I 
wanted you all to read it. It's a nice polemic that takes the 'WYSIWYG versus Markup' 
controversy and reformulates the problem along more fruitful lines. "  The other Lamport 
article is entitled "A simple approach to specifying concurrent systems" : it will soon be 
published in Communications of the ACM. 
Don says the latter paper is the best technical report he has seen in the last year or so. 
The paper is unusual because of its question-and-answer format. While dialogs have been 
used effectively by experts in other fields (such as Socrates, Galileo, George Dantzig, and 
Alfred Renyi), this is the first time, as far as Don knows, that such a format has been used 
in computer science. 
Before moving on to the next handout, Don told us about writing his book Surreal 
Numbers. Like Leslie Lamport's paper, Don's book is presented as a dialog. Don's 
dialog presents some ideas that John Conway told him at lunch one day (Don wrote 
the ideas down on a napkin and then lost the napkin). The most extraordinary aspect 
of this book is that Don wrote it in six days ( "And then I rested" ). That week was 
very special for Don. ( "It was the most exciting week in my life. I don't think I can 
. 
" )  ever recapture It. 
When Don wrote the book he was in Norway. He was in the middle of writing one of 
the volumes of The Art of Computer Programming (isn't he always?) ,  and he did not 
expect Jill (his wife) to be sympathetic when he told her that he wanted to write yet 
another book-even if he did think he could write it in a week. Perhaps Jill knows 
more about Don than Don knows about Jill, because she not only didn't complain 
but she got quite into the spirit of the thing. 
Just what was the spirit of the thing? "Intellectual whimsey" probably isn't far off. 
Don rented a hotel room ( "near where Ibsen wrote" ) and spent his week writing, 
taking long walks ( "to get my head clear"), eavesdropping on his fellow hotel guests 
at breakfast ( "so I could hear what dialog really sounds like" ) ,  and pretending that 
Jill's visits were clandestine ( "we had always read about people having affairs in hotels 
. . . " ) . 
Don said he wrote "with a muse on my shoulder." Every night's sleep was filled with 
ideas and solutions; before dozing off he would have to get up and write down the first 
letter of every word of the ideas he had (and he would spend the morning decoding 
these cryptic scribbles) .  He told us that he was more perceptive during this week­
his description of the King's Garden during an evening walk was worthy of Timothy 
Leary. 
All this prolific word production must have left him in verbal debt: When he finished 
the book he tried to write a letter to Phyllis telling her how to type the book. He 
couldn't. Except he must have eventually-the book is still in print and sells several 
hundred copies a year (in seven languages). 
[§25 . EXAMPLES OF GOOD STYLE 
[56 
Still another handout was part of a chapter written by Nils Nilsson and Mike Genesereth 
for their new book Logical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence. Chapter 6. entitled " :'-ion­
monotonic reasoning," presents a new area of research at the level of a graduate student. 
Don says that the chapter has an excellent blend of formal and informal discussion, wi th 
well-chosen examples; this subject had never been "popularized" before, so the task of 
writing a good exposition was especially challenging. Don also praised the authors' typo­
graphic conventions (for example, logic is presented using a "typewriter" font) .  
Don said that we already have Mary-Claire's book, so he didn't have to introduce her to 
us. But he ran across some electronic mail she had written recently, and thought it was a 
particularly elegant essay, so he passed it along (see §26 below). Computer scientists and 
mathematicians are way behind real writers when it comes to exquisite style. 
Finally, just in case we still craved more good examples to read, he handed out some 
excerpts from a paper written by Garey, Graham, Johnson, and Knuth. Don says that 
he included it because it has two proofs of difficult theorems: proofs that are not, and 
probably could not be, trivial. 
Don tried to interest his readers in the first proof (and algorithm) by presenting an example 
as a mathematical puzzle. He says that by solving the puzzle the reader can see that the 
problem is not simplistic-but that an algorithm might be possible. ( "This builds exactly 
the right mental structures in the reader's mind for this particular problem, I think. The 
algorithm itself is the worst algorithm I have ever had to present-but there is probably 
no simpler one." )  While flashing us part of the algorithm-complete with more cases 
than could fit on the monitor-Don said, "The ability to handle lots of cases is Computer 
Science's strength and weakness. We are good at dealing with such complexity, but we 
sometimes don't try for unity when there is unity." 
The second proof involves the reduction of one problem to another. The reduction requires 
a very complicated system-a system that Don found was well served by an extended 
biological metaphor and some involved terminology. As his metaphor, he chose the jellyfish 
( "an unrooted, free-floating tree" ) ;  he named pieces of the data structure stems, polyps, 
tentacles, heads, and nematocysts (the biological term for stingers). 
Mary-Claire asked, "If that structure turns out to be generally useful, are you going to 
be sad that you called it a nematocyst rather than a stinger?" Don said No, but he 
has been sorry about names he has chosen in the past. ( He wishes he had called LR(k) 
grammars L(k) grammars.) When he was writing The Art of Computer Programming, 
Volume three, he used the word "Daemon" to refer to what are now called "Oracles ," but 
the Oracle replaced the Daemon before it was too late. 
Another last minute terminology substitution happened when Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman 
substituted "NP-complete" for "Polynomially-complete" in their text on Algorithms­
even though they had already gotten galley proofs using the original name. The name 
was changed at that late date as the result of a poll conducted throughout the Theoretical 
Computer Science community (suggested names were NP-Hard, Herculean Problem, and 
Augean Problem).

§26.  MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON 'HOPEFULLY· ] 
§27 . . Excerpts from class, October 28 [notes by TLL] 
Class opened as Don introduced today's guest speaker: Professor Herbert Wilf. Professor 
Wi If is on the faculty at the University of Pennnsylvania but is spending his sabbatical 
year at Stanford. 
As Wilf took the dais he pronounced this "a marvelous course." ( "Taken earlier in my 
career it would have saved me and the world a lot of grief-mostly me." )  The course 
topic is one of daily concern for him; apart from writing his own papers he edits two 
very different journals: the American Mathematical Monthly ( "The MONTHLY" ) and the 
Journal of Algorithms. 
The Journal of Algorithms was founded in 1980 by Wilf and Knuth and is a research 
Journal. Results are reported there if they are new, if they are important, and if they are 
significant contributions to the field. If these conditions are met, a little leeway can be 
given in the area of beautiful presentation. But the MONTHLY is an expository journal. It 
is a home for excellent mathematical exposition. (It also seems to be a popular place to 
send "proofs" of Fermat's Last Theorem.) 
Though he told us that he feels "older without feeling wiser" and is uncomfortable setting 
down rules for a human interaction that "involves part brain and part hormone system" 
he gave us several pointers. 
Get the attention of your readers immediately. Snappy titles, arresting first 
sentences, and lucid initial paragraphs are all methods of doing this. 
As examples, he showed us a paper by Andrew M. Gleason with the title "Trisecting 
the Angle, the Heptagon, and the Triskaidecagon" ;  a paper by Hugh Thurston that 
began "Can a graph be continuous and discontinuous?"; and the first paragraph of 
an autobiographical piece by by Olga Taussky-Todd that started with some insight 
into the author's fascination with matrices. Gleason's paper was attention-getting 
mostly because Gleason is famous-"that helps" . 
Get everything up front. Tell your readers in plain English what you are going to 
write about and let them decide for themselves whether or not they are interested. 
( "You. can quintuple your readership if you will let them in on what it is that you 
are doing." ) 
Remember that people scan papers when they read them. Potential readers 
will skim looking for statements of theorems; if all of your text is discursive they will 
having nothing to latch onto. Summarize your results using bold face ( "or neon" ) 
so that the page flippers can make an informed decision. Similarly, drop notational 
abbreviations and convoluted references in the statements of theorems. 
A little motivation is good, but readers don 't like too much. Presenting 
examples that do not yield desired results can be quite useful, but the technique 
loses its charm after a small number of such examples. (Far from overdoing this 
technique, many writers will introduce mysteriously convenient starting points for 
[§27 .  HERB WILF ON MATHEMATICAL WRITING 59 ]  
[60 
their theorems. "Whenever I see 'Consider the following . . .  ' I know the author 
really means to say 'Here comes something from the left field bleachers. '  " 
He gave us the name of three books (not written by anyone in the room) that he considers 
superb books of mathematics: 
Problems and Tbeorems of Analysis, by P6lya and Szego. It has a "Problems" 
section and an "Answers" section. The problems are self-contained, digestible pieces 
of more complex problems. The answers are on the spare side and have been the 
cause of much head-scratching over the years. By solving several of these self­
contained problems, a reader can arrive at an understanding of major results in the 
field. 
Introduction to Tbe Tbeory of Numbers, by Hardy and Wright. This book is 
"short on motivation." Theorems are stated and proved concisely and precisely. In 
the preface the authors claim that "the subject matter is so attractive that only 
extravagant incompetence could make it dull." 
Matbematical Analysis, by Rudin. This book is rigorous. It teaches the reader 
what is and is not a proof. A reader who survives this book feels strong. 
Wilf commented that all three of these books are quite dry, but Knuth objected (along 
the same lines as those used by Hardy and Wright in their preface) and Wilf amended his 
statement: Each of these books is very lean. 
Discussing the change of his own writing style over time, he told us that when he was 
younger he didn't have much self esteem and stuck to established forms.  Now that he 
feels better about himself he has developed his own, much chattier, style. (Speaking of 
chattiness, he is also a fan of the use of the first-person in technical writing.) He says he 
aims to be chatty leading up to a proof, prove it in the "lean and mean" style that Rudin 
would use, and then be chatty again after he finishes the proof. 
The last things that Wilf discussed were two handouts ( § 28 and § 29 below): "Enumeration 
of orbits of mappings under action of en , the cyclic group," and "Counting necklaces." 
Each handout discusses the same mathematical problem, solved the same way. "Enumer.­
at ion of . . .  " takes a half page; "Counting Necklaces" takes four pages. 
Some audience members will appreciate the half page of exposition that is condensed to 
the word "evidently" in the shorter paper; some will merely be annoyed by it. As the . 
Montbly editor he gets letters from people who complain about the informal style creeping 
into recent publications. "Mathematics is a serious business, not a comic pursuit," said 
one such letter. 
Finally, Wilf doesn't mean to say that either of the two approaches is superior ( "They are 
the two sides of the coin" );  he means for us to examine each and decide what techniques 
we want from each.

§29. From MathWorld 
Counting necklaces 
R. U. Certain 
Suppose we have a supply of beads of Ie different colors, and we wish to 
construct necklaces of n beads. How many different necklaces can we make? 
The word 'different' is to be understood in the sense of rotations; two necklaces 
are equivalent if one can be carried into the other by a rotation. Another 
interesting problem would have resulted if we had allowed the customer to 
pick up the necklace off of the counter and flip it over. In the latter case we 
would have been studying equivalences under the action of the dihedral group 
(generated by a cyclic shift right by 1 unit and a 1800 flip) instead of under 
the Clle/ic group, which is in fact what we're going to talk about here. 
For instance, if n = 4 and Ie = 2 there are 6 different necklaces, and these 
are shown below. 
The problem is to find F(n, Ie), the number of different n-bead necklaces 
of at mo.t Ie colon (let'l call th_ (n, Ie) necklaces) . 
Among all (n,le) necklaces we distinCUish a subset that we will call the 
'prime' necklaces. Say that a necklace is prime if it doea not result from 
concatenating a number of repetitions of a ahorter pattern. ThUl, among 
the (4, 2) necldac. above, the am one is not prime because it results from 
stringing together 4 identical .horter atrlnp (via., 'A'). The third and sixth 
ones are also not prime, whereu the second, fourth and fi.fth ones are prime. 
Let M(n, Ie) denote the number of prim. (n,le) necklaces (e.g., M(4, 2) = 
3). 
The re&lOn for concentrating on these prime necklaces will now appear. 
Con.truction. Berin witb some divisor d of n &ltd a prime (d, Ie) necklace. 
Cut tbe necklace immediately to tbe rigbt of one of it. beads. This yields a 
linear .ftring of lengtb d. Make n/ d copies of that linear .ftnn. &ltd concatenate 
them to produce a .fin,le linear .ftrin, of lengtb n. 
We claim that .1I.rll po •• i61. on. 01 the Ie" po •• i61. linur .trin9. 01 n 6eads 
01 Ie eolor. un he wn8trueted onee and On/II one. 611 .uch a cuttin9 opel'CltiorL 
To prove that, let w be such an n.string, and let d be the smallest integer 
§2g. WILF'S OTHER EXTR£;\lE) 
with the property that w is the concatenation of n/ d copies of a string of length 
d. There is always at least one candidate for such an integer d, since d = n 
will work. Evidently, whatever d is, it is certainly a divisor of n. 
Having found d for the given string w ,  construct a necklace of d beads by 
taking the first d beads from w and tying their ends together. The resulting 
(d, k) necklace is prime (why?) and it is the one and only prime necklace with 
the property that if we apply the 'Construction' stated above, the given string 
w results. 
Hence every prime (d, k) necklace yields d different linear strings, and 
every linear string turns up at some point in the game. That is to say, 
L dM(d, k) = kn (n � 1). 
din 
After Mobius inversion, we get 
M(n,k) = (l/n) L �(n/d)kd (n � 1) (1) 
din 
where � is the Mobius function. Hence we have an explicit formula for the 
number of prime necklaces. 
Unfortunately, that wasn't the question. The question was to find the 
number of all different necklaces whether prime or not. 
Fortunately, the la.tter number, F(n,k), is easily obtainable from M(n, k) . 
Take a. divisor d of n and a prime (d, k) necklace. Cut it somewhere, and make 
n/d copies of the resulting string. Concatenate them (sound familiar?) into 
a single n string, but now (this part shouldn't sound familiar) tie its ends 
together. The result of this opera.tion is a. nuklace, not just a linear string. 
Hence it doesn't matter where we ma.ke the cut: wherever the cut is made, the 
end result is the same necklace. 
Bottom line: F(n,k) = Ld, .. M(d,k) 
Since we ha.ve an explicit formula (1) for M and an explicit formula for F 
in terms of M, we're finished, aren't we? Well in a sense yes, but if we stick 
with it we'll find tha.t simplifying the expression is half the fun. Where we are 
is tha.t 
F(n,k) == L M(d,k) 
dl .. 
== L(l/d) L �(d/d')kd' 
dl.. d'id 
The first step in the simplification process is to invoke the Law of Double 
Sums: 'Intercha.nge Them'. This gives

F(n,k) == L kd' L �(d./d.')/d.

[64 
in which the innermost sum is over d's that are simultaneously divisors of n 
and multiples of d'. 
Now that kind of a sum is very confusing to handle unless you use a 
language that has been attributed by a well-known SU professor to Iverson, 
although said professor has since developed its use to a fare-thee-well. The 
idea is to move all of the fine print up from the bottom of the airline ads into 
the main text so you can see that you have to stay over a weekend to get thee 
best fares. 
The way to apply this sage advice (thymely too) is to use the function T(·) , 
the 'truth-value' function. Its value on any particular ' .' is 1 if its argument is 
true and 0 else. In this case we have, 
L p,(d/d')/d = L T(d'!d)T(d!n)p,(d/d') (l/d) 
d'I!!ln d 
But T(d'!d) = T(3t : d = td') , so we can replace d by td' in the inner sum 
above, and sum on t. The inner sum now becomes 
L T(td'!n)p,(t)/t = L p,(t)/t 
c tl(n/d') 
where the fine print has now reverted to the bottom of the ad. 
Next we want to relate this lut sum to Euler's totient function, from the 
theory of numbers. The well known evaluation of the Euler function in terms 
of the prime factorization of an integer n is 
if>(n) = n II (1 - l/p) 
pin 
where the product is over prime divisors of n. IT we multiply out all of the 
factors of the product we get an enormous alternating sum of reciprocals of 
various product. of prime divisors of n. Those product. run through precisely 
the square-free divisors of n, i.e., those in which no prime factor is repeated, 
and those are exactly the divisors of n on which the Mobius function is nonzero. 
What that all boils down to is that 
if>(n)/n = L P,(d)/d. 
din 
IT we substitute into the inner sum that we've been fussing over, and then 
substitute back in (2) we get the finallinal result that exactly 
F(n, k) = (l/n) L if>(n/d)kd (3) 
dl" 
different necklaces of " beads can be made out of beads of k colors. 
§2g. WILF'S OTHER EXTRE.\Il, 1 
There will be a brief pause while everybody lets n = 4 and k = 2 to see 
that the formula really gives F(4. 2) = 6 ...... ..... 0K. now that that's out of the 
way. let's try another simple case of the formula. This time. suppose n is a 
prime number. The virtue of that assumption is that primes have only two 
divisors. so there are only two terms in the sum for F(n. k} . Aper recalling 
that ¢(n) = n - 1  if (and only if) n is prime. we discover that 
F(p. k) = (kP - k + pk)/p. J 
Now the exact number is not the thing that is most interesting here. It's 
the fact that the right hand side is an integer. It has to be. because it's the 
number of ways of doing something! Thus. the numerator. kP - k + pk must be 
divisble by p. and therefore kP - k must be divisble by p, whatever the positive 
integer k might be. Well that is exactly Fermat's Little theorem, and we got a 
proof of it as a spinoff from a combinatorial formula. The main point is that 
counting formulas must give integer answers, and if the answers don't look like 
integers then we may have discovered something interesting. 
By the way, formula (3) must still be an integer even when n isn't prime. 
but it sure doesn't look like it. I wonder what that might mean ...

§30. Excerpts from class, November 18 
"No man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money." 
[notes by PMRj 
-Samuel Johnson, quoted in Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson 
April 5th, li/6 
Today we got an entirely different perspective on the whole ball of wax. Don began his 
fortnight's sabbatical by turning the stage over to one of Computer Science's most prolific 
authors: Professor Jeff Ullman. A large crowd had gathered to hear Jeff's advice on "How 
to get rich by writing books" -an illustration of one of the principles of cover design, he 
said: Attract people with something that isn't in the book at all. 
Jeff started by talking a bit about the pragmatics of publishing-how the money flows. He 
kicked off with a back-of-an-envelope calculation. A book is a megabyte of text. Jeff can 
write perhaps two or three kilobytes of first draft per hour-say one kilobyte per hour of 
finished text. We can all train ourselves up to much the same performance, he asserted. So 
it takes around a thousand hours of labour to write a book. Now then, a typical CS text 
might sell for $40. A good book on a specialized topic, or a mediocre book on a general 
topic, might well sell 1500 copies in the US and 500 copies abroad. (These figures put the 
200,000 copies of Don's ACP sold in the USSR into some perspective.) A 15% royalty is 
standard on domestic sales, a rather lower rate for foreign sales. All in all, our talented 
specialist or so-so generalist can expect to net maybe $8000 over his book's lifetime of 
perhaps five years. Of course, fame as well as fortune is to be gained through publication, 
but Jeff dismissed such non-financial motivations as being beyond the scope of his talk. 
"I told you to be a lawyer. Or a doctor," someone's mother was heard to whisper. But 
Jeff forestalled a mass exodus to the GSB by going on to tell us how to make book-writing 
a going concern. Firstly, he said, it's quite feasible to double the royalty rate. CS authors 
have some leverage with publishers in that their books sell quite well-a publisher's costs 
are very sub linear in the number of copies sold, so he can afford to pay a lot more for a 
book that will sell 5000, instead of 2000, copies. What's more, a computer scientist often 
keeps his publisher's costs down by preparing his own camera-ready copies. Jeff is happy 
to tell you more about how to drive a hard bargain with your publisher-go and talk to 
him about it! 
Secondly, you need to aim for ten thousand domestic sales; say two thousand a year for five 
years. That's 5-10% of the entire market in a topic like compilers or operating systems. 
There's nothing off-the-wall about this, provided you find the right niche: Let yours be 
the hardest book on the subject, or the easiest. Or the best. This wasn't so hard to do in 
the early days of CS, when there was a big demand for textbooks but only a few authors; 
it's certainly going to get harder as the field matures. If you're going for the big bucks, 
advised Jeff, choose a young and booming field-biogenetics perhaps. 
Increase your royalties and sales, arid your efforts can net you as much as a medium-grade 
hooker's: say $100 per hour. Top-notch computer scientists should aspire to no less. 
§30. JEFF ULLMAN ON GETTING RICHI 
A miscellany of tips 
• Find a co-author or two. Co-authors won't save you any time, but they do help 
filter out your idiosyncrasies. Jeff said that when he writes alone "my own craziness 
takes over" and the book turns out a dud. He was just "too weird" in Principles 
of Programming Systems-although not too weird for the Japanese, who continue to 
buy it. His Database book went well, though probably because Chris Date's book 
provided a framework and the necessary "dose of reality." Filtering out oddball stuff 
has a big effect on quality. And since a textbook that is only marginally better than 
the competition will nevertheless grab the lion's share of sales, any small impro"ement 
is well worth having. 
• Jeff never saw a book with too many examples. Use lots. Even a very simple example 
will get three-quarters of an idea across. A page or two later you can refine it with 
a complex example that illustrates all the "grubbies." But finding good examples­
examples that illustrate all and only the points you are concerned with-is not easy; 
Jeff has no recipe. You must be prepared to spend a lot of time on it. 
• Jeff endorsed Don's exhortation: "Put yourself in the reader's place!" If Mary-Claire 
concurs, we may even be convinced. 
• Spend the day reading about a topic, and write it up in the evening. That way, you'll 
get the expository order right. You have an advantage over the experts because you 
can still remember what was hard to learn. 
• Jeff often sees a definition in Chapter 2 and its use in Chapter 5. This just isn't the 
way readers work; it's essential to keep definitions and uses close together. Don't be 
ashamed to repeat yourself if that's what it takes. 
• Those who can, do; those who can't, teach; those who can't teach, show off. Remember 
that the object of exposition is education, not showmanship. 
• There is a tradeoff in using powerful mechanics to justify your methods; they may 
be too opaque. Jeff had to decide whether to spend 20 pages teaching asymptotic 
analysis in order to spend 5 pages applying its theorems, or whether just to say "It 
can be shown that . . .  " and refer his readers to another text. In the end he got around 
the dilemma by doing only the most basic calculations and proving nothing deep. In 
general, keep the level of your exposition down so that you can rely on your readers 
understanding it. 
A couple of tactical remarks: 
State the type� of your variables. Talk about ' . . .  the set S . . .  " not about ' . . ' S . .  ' ' .  
Jeff's English professor, now a leading poet, told him never to use the non-referential 'this ' .  
Recognizing the dearth of poetry in CS, Jeff now forbids his students to use it  either. 90% 
of the time it doesn't matter; the other 10% leaves your readers bewildered. One book 
presents four ideas in a row and then says "This leads us to consider . . . " .  What leads US 
to consider? 
[§30 .  JEFF ULLMAN ON GETTING RICH 671 
[68 
Coping with the competition 
Like it or not, book-writing is an increasingly competitive sport. But just because every 
other introductory Pascal text starts with 'write' statements doesn't mean that yours has 
to starts with 'while', just to be different. Don't slavishly imitate another's style, but 
don't avoid it either. Know the market, know thyself, and work out a compromise of your 
own. Don't hesitate to follow the crowd when they are all going in the right direction. 
This last remark brought Jeff ( "I am not a lawyer") Ullman round to the tricky subject 
of plagiarism. According to Prentice-Hall's Guide to Authors, imitation ceases to be the 
sincerest form of flattery and becomes something much more culpable if a reasonable person 
could not believe that you didn't have the other chap's book open in front of you as you 
wrote yours. That said, remember that you can't copyright ideas as such, but only ways 
of expressing them. Jeff shamelessly admits that his Compilers book borrowed another 's 
table of contents and the general front-to-back expository scheme. 
Jeff showed us a suspicious case in which an author had written "Knuth has shown . . . . , 
and then went on to quote more-or-Iess verbatim from ACP. The coincidence of notation 
is hardly conclusive, he said, but the identical use of italics is pretty damning. 
Don here pointed out that his disciple had actually corrected a typo, for one sentence 
was in fact the exact logical negation of the other. But this book contained much worse 
examples of plagiarism: A dozen or so successive equations lifted straight from elsewhere. 
In these notes, names have been suppressed to protect the guilty. 
Someone asked about second and subsequent editions. Jeff said that these will still consume 
a kilohour or so, although they'll go faster if you can use your earlier examples. But the 
financial advantages are very real: People stop buying a book when it has been out for five 
years, so publish a new edition and start the clock ticking again! 
One person asked about writing survey papers-surely they will contain a lot of verbatim 
quotes? There's no problem since the writer is not presenting the work as his own, Jeff 
said. Besides, accusations of plagiarism hinge on financial loss, and no one writes technical 
papers to make money. But be explicit in your quotation if you feel more comfortable 
doing so. 
Why don't expositions of CS make more use of analogy, asked someone, drawing an analogy 
with physics texts (which are planted thick with analogy, metaphor, and simile). Jeff 
thought it partly due to the nature of the subject, but encouraged us to use analogy where 
we are sure that the reader will get the point. 
Asked about progress on Parallel Computation, Jeff confessed that it may never be finished: 
"That's another point about co-authors . . .  " .  Jeff left us, and Don, to reflect on his maxim: 
"Never spend more than a year on anything." 
§ 30.  JEFF ULLMAN ON GETTING RICHI 
§31 . Excerpts from class, November 20 [notes by TLL] 
Today's special guest lecturer was Leslie Lamport of DECSRC. Leslie, sporting a Mama '. 
Barbeque T-shirt ( "WALK IN - PIG OUT" ),  took the stage and gave us a very active 
lecture. (He clearly believes in one of his own maxims: "You've got to be excited about 
what you are doing.")  
The first thing Leslie told us was that he would restrict his advice to the writing of papers 
(not books) .  "I have one thing to say about writing a paper for publication: Don't. The 
market is flooded. Why add to the detritus?" After the appropriate dramatic pause, he 
continued with, "But seriously folks, somebody has to write papers." 
While we are asking ourselves if our own papers are worth writing, Leslie asks that we 
keep in mind two bad reasons for writing a paper: 
The first bad reason is "to have a long publications list." Leslie says he would like to think 
that the people who are supposed to be impressed by a long publications list would be 
more impressed with quality than quantity. Admitting that this might not always be the 
case, he appealed to our own sense of integrity to police us where others' standards do not . 
The second bad reason is "to have a paper published in a specific conference." Leslie 
has known people whose need to insert papers in specific proceedings is greater than their 
need to disseminate accurate information. This approach "sometimes leads to pretty sloppy 
papers." He told us that he knows of one case where the authors of a conference paper 
promised to send a correction, once they figured it out, to each conference participant. 
Leslie recognizes one good reason to publish a paper: "You have done something that you 
are excited about." 
Just how excited can you be and yet not publish a paper? Leslie was once told: "Judge an 
artist not by the quality of what is framed and hanging on the walls, but by the quality of 
what's in the wastebasket." Similarly, Leslie thinks that we should be judged on the "best 
thing that we have done that we decided not to publish." 
Moving on to how we learn to write well, Leslie told us that learning to write is more like 
learning to play the piano than like learning to type. While both typing and piano-playing 
involve motor skills, a good pianist must spend much time studying music in its entirety; 
he must ·spend more time away from the piano than in front of it. Correspondingly, we 
should learn to write by reading. Leslie payed homage to Halmos and Knuth, but said that 
they can not match Fowles and Eliot: We should read great literature in order to learn 
how to write good mathematical literature. 
We must know what we want to present before we can present it well. As Leslie said, 
"Bad writing comes from bad thinking, and bad thinking never produces good writing." 
We must keep in mind what we are writing-and to whom. 
The question of audience is closely related to where a paper, once written, should be 
published. Appropriate places may be a Tech Report, a letter, a Journal, or the bottom 
drawer of your desk. (Don't really throw anything out: it is good to have the record-, even 
if you don't publish your work.) How do we choose? 
[§ 31 .  LESLIE LAMPORT ON WRITING PAPERS 69J 
[70 
Journal articles should be polished and timeless. Conference papers can be a little rougher. 
Conference papers are appropriate for work that is "not yet ready for the archives."' Tech­
nical reports (usually distributed by an institution) are good for work that is not even 
ready for the general world but still should be written up. 
Leslie asks us to remember that "in each case, you still have readers. That tech report 
may some day turn into a Journal article. You've got to be excited about your writing." 
As for the central theme of a paper, Leslie told us that he enjoys the Elizabethan use of the 
word "conceit" to denote a fanciful or cute idea around which a paper can be built. vVhile 
such an idea can be a good catalyst as we begin to write, we should be willing to abandon 
it .  After all, we use such metaphors or themes in order to present ideas-we should not 
allow them to intrude. The line between what can be called a conceit and the merely cute 
is a fine one. Beware of jokes. Just how funny will a joke be ten years after it was included 
in a Journal paper? 
While jokes should be left out, examples are welcome additions to most papers. Leslie 
said, "It is better to have one-solid example than to have a dry, abstract, academic paper." 
He also said that it is never a mistake to have too simple an example ("at least not for a 
lecture" ). Demonstrating that "examples keep you honest," Leslie told us about a major 
revision of one of his published theories upon discovering that his original draft of the 
theory was not powerful enough to deal with the example that he wanted to use in his 
paper. 
Expressing concern that people often "fix the sentence and not the idea," Leslie told us 
that we can be too concerned with details. For example, he tells us not to think about 
formatting when we are writing. ( "Don't think about format. Do think about structure." )  
He suggests that whenever we have some detail, such as complex notation, we shouldn't 
write it out: We should use a macro. 
Leslie discussed trends in notation, showing us a translation of Newton's Principia Matb­
ematica. Newton stated his mathematical theorems in non-mathematical language that 
was very difficult to read. Instead of saying that something is inversely proportional to the 
square of the distance, we can get the point across better by saying that it is c/ If} .  
Thus algebra has provided us with a tool for presenting the structure of a formula. But 
can't we improve present practice by making the structure of an entire discourse more clear? 
Leslie gave us a handout demonstrating two forms of a proof: a paragraph form and a form 
that looks like the tabular proofs that high-school students produce in Plane Geometry 
homework. (See §33 below.) Pointing out that the tabular proof is much more easy to 
read, Leslie cautioned us that he was not talking about formatting, but the structure that 
the tabular form enforces. He says that writing proofs in such tabular "statement-reason" 
forms will help us clarify proofs that are to be presented in paragraph style. (The flip side 
of the handout also contains an example that Leslie did not have time to explain. The 
example shows some "bloated prose" that Leslie trimmed down by half.) 
In discussing writing itself, Leslie said, "You should be excited about what you are writing 
and that excitement should show." Saying that this principle can especially be applied 
to first sentences ( "You want something that leaps out at you" ) ,  he read us several first 
§31 . LESLIE LAMPORT ON WRITING PAPERS! 
sentences from various compositions. The first sentence can be expected to be nontechnical 
and to represent an author's best effort. He was pleased with some of the first sentences 
from his own work and less pleased with others, but he was ecstatic about some of the 
first sentences he read us by T. S .  Eliot or Allen Ginsburg. Thus it might be a good idea 
to ask ourselves: "What would T. S. have written, if he were writing this paper?" 
What characterizes a good first sentence? Leslie says to "avoid passive wimpiness," but 
to be simple and direct . "Get right down to business." Of course, once you have hit your 
readers in the gut with your first sentence, you can't let them down with your second. 
Continuing in this vein, by induction, "When you come to sentence number 2079, you've 
got to keep socking it to them." (He illustrated this by reading an arresting sentence from 
the middle of The Four quartets by T. S. Eliot , choosing the sentence at random.)  
Leslie finished his lecture by saying, "I am not T.  S .  Eliot. I need to pay more attention 
to my writing. As do we all."

In this section, we describe some 
of the highlights of the research 
area. We discuss some of the most 
significant, elegant, and useful al­
gorithms, and some corresponding 
lower bound results. Since the lit­
erature in the azea iS,vast and var· 
ied, we have found the selection 
and organization of these results 
to be a formidable task. We have 
chosen to simplify our task by re­
stricting our attention to four ma­
jor categories of results: shared 
memory algorithms, distributed 
consensus algorithms, distributed 
network algorithms and concur­
rency control. Each of these cate­
gories has a very rich research lit­
erature of its own, and we think 
that together, they provide a rep­
resentative picture of work in the 
area. Still, our description i. in­

In this section, 
we discuss some of the most signif·

results. 
We restrict our attention to four 
major categories: shared memory 
algorithms, distributed consensus 
algorithms, distributed network 
algorithms and concurrency con·

Although we are neglecting many 
interesting topics, these four areas 
provide a representative picture of

§34. Excerpts from class, November 23 (notes by PMRj 
Nils Nilsson, latest in our line-up of megastar guest speakers, spoke on the subject of "Art 
and Writing." He began by showing us two photographs: Edward Weston's print of a 
snail-shell (strangely reminiscent of a human form) ,  and Ansel Adams's "Aspens in New 
Mexico." Having thus set the artistic mood, Nils went on to talk about what this has to 
do with writing. Novels and plays are recognised as art; mathematical writing should also 
qualify, he said. Writing can be both art and communication; indeed, real communication 
happens only when writing is charged with artistic passion. 
For Nils, a key word is Composition. Nils once took a course in photography from a teacher 
who declared that: 
Composition = Organisation + Simplification. 
This formulation made a lasting impression on Nils. It applies equally to writing as to 
photography. A quote from Edward Weston: "Composition is the strongest way of see­
ing." A typical artistic phrase, said Nils, but what does it mean? Some might say that 
Weston anticipated the findings of recent research in computer vision: The viewer must 
participate, construct models, form hypotheses. There are no spectator sports! Likewise, 
a photographer sees best when a scene is well-composed. 
"Life is very nice, but it lacks form. 
It is the aim of art to give it some." 
- Jean Anouilh. 
But like all art, said Nils, writing should be fun. Just as the painter takes pleasure in the 
smell of his paints, so should the writer feel good when surrounded by the tools of his art: 
paper, ink, typewriter, word-processor, whatever. He must feel a thrill, as Don does when 
pin-pointing a reference. Another key word, then, is Joy. 
But if writing is to be art, we must first master the craft . Only when our grasp of the 
minutire is perfect can we transcend technique and aspire to genius. Nils gave us a "broad 
brush" overview of some important points, along with some autobiographical tales. 
L Start early_ Impressionable minds are best. Some people find that writing becomes 
a real compulsion; if this happens to you, then let the urge take over' 
Way back in 1954 Nils took a Stanford course on "Scientific Writing." Writing an essay 
or two a week, he learned to become clear and organised-and got an A- for his paper on 
"Ionic Oscillations." Nils was pretty pleased, and thus began his career as a writer. In the 
Air Force, he discovered a growing urge to write a book about radar; he realises now that 
this was mainly a compulsion to get the material organised. By 1960 he had an outline of 
the book, but it never saw the light of day; after leaving the Air Force he joined SRI and 
got deeply involved with something else entirely (Neural Nets, as it happens) . 
2. Write, rewrite, rewrite, rewrite _ . ,  _ This dictum really is true, said Nils. It 
is the extremely rare artist who does not need to labour over and over on his' work. 
Mozart was said to be an exception; his first draft was his final version. Beethoven, 
l§34 . NILS NILSSON ON ART AND WRITING 73] 
- [74 
on the other hand, rewrote his work over and over, and even then was never satisfied. 
As someone once remarked: "A work of art is never completed, only abandoned." 
A member of the class quoted Robert Heinlein as saying that a writer must resist the urge 
to rewrite. (But then, Heinlein writes great thick books and pretty poor ones at that. 
Likewise, Barbara Cartland is said to wander about the house dictating her novels into a 
tape-recorder, whence they are transcribed and published. Of the literary qualities of her 
work, the less said the better . )  
"Easy writing makes damned hard reading." Nils couldn't remember the source of this 
quote '* Hemingway put it rather more colourfully, which we blush to repeat here. Think 
of your early drafts as being like an artist's sketches, urged Nils: Be prepared to throw 
away nearly all of them. Neither are you done when the book is finished and on the shelves. 
Maurice Karnaugh (inventor of Karnaugh Maps) wrote to Nils after Principles of Al·tificiai 
Intelligence was published and pointed out that the A' algorithm as Nils had defined it 
would fail on a certain graph. This led to a correction in a subsequent edition. 
Never let anything you write be published without having had others critique it. A univer­
sity is a good environment in which to get feedback on your work, though you may need 
to give some thought to the timing of your requests for comments (unless you have infinite 
resources of willing readers) .  Nils told us about the time that he thought he had a neat 
result in non-monotonic reasoning and circumscription. He wrote it up and sent it to John 
McCarthy, who passed it on to Vladimir Lifschitz, who discovered that Nils's derivation 
"appeared to contain an oversight . . .  " . 
Nils always tries to teach a course on a topic at the time that he is writing it up-it's 
ridiculous to inflict your ramblings on the world unless you are prepared to do this, he 
said. 
Nils decided that since he had the whole book on-line, he would take a crack at publishing it 
himself. He and his wife Karen set up the Tioga Publishing Company. One big advantage 
about this cottage-industry approach is the ease with which the author can make changes 
in subsequent editions. Karen went on to become a full-time publisher; Tioga's theme has 
now changed from AI to nature and the environment. So Nils considers himself pretty well 
"vertically integrated" in the world of books. 
3. Read. 
working. 
Read a great deal; it'll sharpen your style and get your critical faculties 
4. Model the Reader. Deja vu. This should be obvious, said Nils, but there's really 
a lot to it. Ask yourself what the reader's primitives are, and write with them in mind. 
In fact, the whole issue is so complex and important that Nils likes to operationalise it 
with AI-type "dremons." Any number of these have to be running in the background 
as you write, catching errors and providing constructive criticism. You have to be 
asking all the time; "How is the reader going to misunderstand me here?" You must 
* "Easy reading is damned hard writing." -Nathaniel Hawthorne. (Just lucky to find 
it -DEK.) 
§34. NILS NILSSON ON ART AND WRITING] 
automatically insert forests of guidelines to keep him on track. You develop these 
daemons by practice-it's a kind of motor skill, like playing tennis or riding a bicycle. 
A split infinitive should really jar, Nils said: "It's got to light up in red!" The daemons 
have to run automatically; you can't be consciously checking a list of rules all the time. 
Besides, if writing is to be fun, it can't be compulsive! 
5. Master the Medium. You need a good vocabulary, though this needn't mean a 
huge list of big words. There are issues other than pure language: indexes, tables , 
graphs, and how to use them to best effect. As Don pointed out earlier, we can use 
typography to make important distinctions, as with the typewriter font for logical 
formulae. 
In the future, said Nils, it's clear that reacling and writing will be far more interactive 
processes-The Media Lab is not all hype. It's not clear yet what will prove necessary or 
useful; just as i t  took several centuries to invent the index, it will probably take us a long 
time to identify the "stable points" offered by our new technology. We in the audience are 
at the cutting edge of these experiments. 
6. Master the Material. There's a lot of internal feedback involved in wri ting; one 
comes to understand the material in a new way on trying to organise it for publication. 
Nils drew this diagram :

As Mary-Claire said on Wednesday, "How do I know what I mean until I hear what I say?" 
Even Nils sometimes finds himself thinking "I don't believe that!" when he hears himself 
lecture. I am reminded of the (true) story of a professor who was always seen to take a pad 
of blank paper with him when he delivered a talk. When asked what was for, he replied: 
"Why, if I say anything good I'll want to write it down!"  So go to lecture� and classes, 
give talks. All these things help modify your internal model and get things into shape. 
"In a very real sense, the writer writes in order to teach himself, to understand 
himself; the publishing of his ideas, though it brings gratifications, is a curious 
anticlimax."

[§34 . NILS NILSSON ON ART AND WRITING 75) 
[ 76 
7. Simplify. Lie, if it helps. You can add the correct details later on. but it is essential 
to present the reader with something straightforward to start off with. So don't be 
afraid to bend the facts initially where this leads to a useful simplification and then 
pay back the debt to truth later by gradual elaborations. 
"Another noteworthy characteristic of this manual is that it doesn't always tell 
the truth." 
- Don Knuth, The TE;X book (page vii ) 
"Everything should always be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." 
- Albert Einstein 
Ted Shortliffe did a great job with Mycin, Nils said. But with 20/20 hindsight he might 
have done better to invent a simplified system for expository purposes. For example, 
he could have demonstrated the backward-chaining techniques and only later dealt with 
"certainty factors." 
By using simple examples we can get ourselves on the winning side of the 80-20 rule: we 
can convey 80% of the truth with only 20% of the difficulty. Mathematicians, of course, 
like to go the other way: They never state a theorem in three dimensions if it can be 
generalised to n .  Such terse elegance can be painful for the reader. 
8. A void Recycling. With on-line text and sophisticated editors (I  refer to software, 
not the mandarins behind Scientiiic American) it is very tempting to re-use portions 
of old material. Resist the temptation. Almost certainly you are writing in a new 
context, with a new emphasis. Hopefully you are older and wiser, and perhaps even a 
better writer than you were when the old material was written. So do rewrite it , it's 
worth the extra effort. 
9. Aim for Excellence. You've got to keep shooting for perfection, even if you'll never 
get there. What the Great have said on this: 
"We are all apprentices in a craft where no-one ever becomes a master." 
- Ernest Hemingway 
"Someday I'll build the perfect birch-bark canoe." 
- John McPhee 
"Someday I'll write the perfect AI textbook." 
- Nils Nilsson 
"Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?" 
- William Blake 
"The message of these books is that, here in the 80s, 'good' is no longer good 
enough. In today's business environment, 'good' is a word we use to describe 
an employee whom we are about to transfer to a urinal-storage facility in the 
Aleutian Islands. What we want, in our 80s business executive, is somebody 
§34. NILS NILSSON ON ART AND WRITING) 
who demands the best in everything; somebody who is never satisfied; somebody 
who, if he had been in charge of decorating the Sistine Chapel, would have said: 
"That is a good fresco, Michelangelo, but I want a better fresco, and I want it by 
tomorrow morning." 
- Dave Barry 
§35. Excerpts from class, November 25 (notes by TLL] 
Don opened class by introducing guest lecturer Mary-Claire van Leunen and by giving us 
the title of her talk: "Calisthenics." Mary-Claire opened her talk by telling us a story. 
Many years ago Mary-Claire was a frequent passenger on the Chicago bus system. The 
neighborhood where she boarded her #5 bus was a gathering spot for "bummy guys . "  
All of these guys were interested in money: Some begged, others peddled. Among the 
peddlers-hawking wares ranging from trenchcoats full of watches to freedom from the 
peddler's presence--was a man whom Mary-Claire patronized quite regularly. He sold 
pencil stubs (obviously collected from trash bins); but Mary-Claire said his patter was 
charming enough to rate one or two purchases a week. 
"These pencils are magic pencils," he would say. "Buy a magic pencil. Only 25 
cents. " 
"What's a magic pencil?" would come the expected response. 
"With this pencil, you can write the truth." 
Inevitably, someone would pipe up, "But I can write lies with it." 
"Oh, you can break the magic. But if you really believe, you can write the truth." 
Mary-Claire sees this as the wonder and the motivation behind the craft of writing: If 
you work hard, you can explain a new truth to someone you will never meet-perhaps to 
someone who will live after you are dead. 
Such a vocation requires preparation. The Composition Exercises that Mary-Claire has 
given us (see §36 below) were designed to help US become as strong as we can. Our readers 
are more likely to be tolerant of a few weaknesses if they are surrounded and supported 
by strength. 
Mary-Claire has given these exercises to students before, but preparing this draft for 
our class pushed her to really write the exercises. The copy that she referred to over 
the TV monitors was slightly different than the copies that we have been given. Mary­
Claire, hoping that these differences represent improvements, invites us to suggest further 
improvements to the draft. (She says that she might publish something that evolves from 
this draft-but probably not soon: She is not a fast writer.) 
The first set of exercises, labeled "Vocabulary," is designed to increase our command of 
just that. 
The first of the pair is an exercise that was done by little Greek boys: Taking a composition 
and swapping all the old words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) for new ones. What 
[§J5 · MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON CALISTHENICS (1)  77] 
[78 
is the effect of these changes? What happens when a vulgarism is used? When a hoity-toity 
word is used? 
The second vocabulary exercise, the writing of a thesaurus entry, is best done o\-er a 
week. After several days of slowly adding to our set of synonyms, we should compare 
our entry with an entry in our thesaurus. ( Everyone needs at least one thesaurus and a 
good unabridged dictionary. In addition to more than one kind of dictionary, Mary-Claire 
recommends Sidney Landau's book Dictionaries to help us understand how to best use our 
dictionaries. ) 
"Syntax," the next set of exercises, deals with syntactic mastery. Mary-Claire says even 
though vocabulary improvement is more often considered than increasing our command 
of syntax, syntactic armory improvement is more important. She says that most of the 
time we will use our basic three to four thousand words; we must use them in the most 
interesting way possible_ 
Speaking of using words in interesting ways, Mary-Claire has been reading the first draft 
of our term papers. There must be room for some improvement there: Her first comment 
was, "Nobody sits down to write a boring paper." How can we tell when something we 
write is "syntactically impoverished" ? She gathered some statistics that might help us get 
the right idea. 
One of her tricks was to study the first 10 complete sentences on the third page of every 
paper. First she charted the average length of the 10 sentences: They varied from 15.6 
sentence to 24.4 words per sentence. Mary-Claire says that any of us with averages under 
20 words per sentence are in the correct range for adult writing_ (But the writer with the 
24.4 average had better have results pretty wonderful, to compensate for the extra work 
that it takes to read his paper.) 
Sheer variation in sentence length is one indication of syntactic variation and appropriate 
pacing. With 10 sentences we should be aiming for 9 or 10 different lengths. The samples 
from our papers yielded 6 to 9 different lengths. The difference between the word count 
on the shortest sentence to the word count on the longest varied between 17 words to 37 
words. The ideal chart of sentence lengths should look like a bell-curve centered around 
15 to 18 words per sentence. 
She asks us to note that we did not have enough short ( "and punchy" ) sentences. A few 
long sentences are also important. She said, "A well constructed 46-word sentence is not 
a difficult beast, but it had better not be the your crucial point." We should remember 
that we have a responsibility to emphasize and deemphasize our points to the reader; long 
sentences are one method of deemphasizing a point. 
Beyond the word counts, she looked at the the templates used to construct our sentences. 
For example, she found two writers who would appear to be similar if we just looked 
at their sentence length average and variation, but who had quite different methods of 
constructing their sentences. One of these writers used the same sentence construction for 
almost every sentence (adverbial + subject + transitive-verb + object), and the other 
used many different styles of construction. But the second writer was not free of flaws. He 
had two sentences in a row with a full independent clause followed by a full parenthetical 
§35 .  MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON CALISTHENICS (I I ]  
independent clause. Mary-Claire says that we must learn what syntactic usage is unusual 
so that we do not overuse it. 
One syntactic trick not normally thought unusual was startlingly absent from our papers: 
tight parallels. The use of two adjacent sentences with exactly the same construction is 
an effective way to communicate similarity to our readers. Mary-Claire is curious how we 
could all avoid this technique. Perhaps it is an artifact of the way that students of our 
generation were taught? 
Given this motivation to "increase our syntactic muscle," Mary-Claire led us back to 
discussing the "Syntax" exercises. She passed over the first two exercises as obvious, but 
a few comments were made on "periodic" sentences. 
We who have had mathematical training might be tempted to guess that a periodic sentence 
is one that repeats cyclically, but we would be wrong. Periodic sentences are those whose 
grammatical and physical ends coincide: We must get adverbials out of the final position. 
For example, a verb that is intransitive must end the sentence. Period. 
Periodic sentences are not really appropriate in our kind of writing; they are a high literary 
form. Even though such a sentence form is more frequently encountered in church than in 
conference papers, the use of periodic sentences will heighten our awareness that we can 
control sentence structure. 
The next exercise has us recast a sentence so as to change emphasis. What are the emphatic 
positions? The front of the sentence and the back. ( "The middle of a sentence is sort of a 
slum.") But she says not to take her word for it ; we should write sentences with varying 
emphasis and find out for ourselves. 
Mary-Claire says that the last syntactic exercise is "incredibly wonderful" : Write nonsense. 
Write a completely unrelated stream of thoughts with the correct glue: Words like "thus," 
"therefore," and "as we can see." She says this is a fun exercise to do after a couple of 
drinks. (Maybe we need a class lab?) 
Moving on to exercises labeled "Manual labor," Mary-Claire told us that these should 
logically come first, but she wanted to woo us with the logical stuff before we ran into the 
weird stuff. Why is it important to use different methods to copy other people's writing? 
Because writing-and even reading-is partly a manual process. Mary-Claire typed out 
large sections of our papers as she was analyzing them. She said that if you tie a baby's 
hands behind his back, but give him otherwise adequate mental stimulation, he will not 
learn to speak well. 
When we want to read a passage of text seriously, such manual labor can help us slow our 
brains down until we can give the passage the consideration it deserves. (W. H. Auden 
said that the proper way to show contempt for a poem is to copy it on a typewriter; the 
proper way to show admiration is to copy it in longhand.) Memorization and recitation 
can also help us to be able to read word by word. ( "Make yourself into a book that you 
can take to prison should worse come to worst ." )  
Mary-Claire i s  aware that we may not buy this "manual labor" technique a.t first, but she 
asks us to take it on faith. She took the technique on faith for ten �ears and then wrote a 
[§35 MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON CALISTHENICS (1) 
[80 
. .  _ �  _ - - � r'  • •  " � V � " ..J .  
Most writers are aware how important the manual part of composition is: They have very 
rigid restrictions on how they compose. ( "Oh, I can only write on yellow pads with a 
fountain pen." Mary-Claire says we should be able to compose on a cocktail napkin. 
While discussing the section labeled "Frozen sounds," Mary-Claire told us about reading 
aloud to her students their own writing. Some students were chagrined; others glowed. 
She says we should form partnerships with other novice writers: Read and listen to each 
other. But she cautions that a little goes a long way. If the writing is good, we can live on 
that joy for quite a while; if the writing is bad, we won't be able to stand it for very long. 
At this point in the lecture, Mary-Claire noticed that very few minutes remained. So her 
comments on the final exercises were limited to those that she thought were the most 
important. 
Concerning the "Marks on paper" exercises, Mary-Claire quoted from E. M. Forster: "How 
do I know what I mean till I see what I say?" We need to remember that writing is "the 
most forgiving medium known to man." We can work on it until we get it right. 
Rushing past the "Stance, voice, and tone" section, she told us that she borrowed tech­
niques from speech therapists-who ask patients to exaggerate their defects until they 
understand just exactly what characterizes their defects. For example, she says, "If any 
one has ever told you that you are 'breezy,' write something truly off the wall." 
She told us that the sections labeled "Observation," "Same as and different from," and 
"Invention" are less important for us than for pure writers. Our discipline provides the 
glue that writers with more freedom have to manufacture from scratch. 
She warns us that the "Scansion" exercises are hard, but very important. She realizes that 
she may have trouble convincing us that we need to write verse in order to learn to write 
mathematics, but once again she says, "Trust me." 
She reminded us that the "Precis" exercises were touched upon by Leslie Lamport in his 
talk. At some point we cannot reduce the word count of a piece of prose without changing 
the structure of that prose. ( We should never change the meaning, but we will have 
to dispense with some details.) This point comes at different percentages of decrease­
depending on the flabbiness of the original text. 
The final exercises she discussed, "Nearly real," are aptly named. They really are very 
much like real writing. For instance, Mary-Claire says that "Writing a joke is exposition 
at its purest. Things aren't funny unless they a,re well written." 
She suggests that we try "Ben Franklin's exercise," rewriting a passage of someone else's 
from memory and limited written hints-but that we try it with Don's writing. When we 
have finished, what do we like better about Dan's version? What do we like better about 
our own? 
Before the cameraman could shoo us out of the room, Mary-Claire reminded us once again 
that these exercises are "very hard work." She closed with, "I hope they will serve you as 
well as they have served me."

Composition Exercises 
"' Draft · .. 
Mary-Oaire van Leunen 
Unless you plan to do nothing else but composition exercises, there are enough here to last you for the 
next decade. I had a wonderful student who did nearly all of them in a year, but he really did do nothing 
else. Some of the exercises are quite deep, and you might easily be able to do them again and again in 
different guises for the rest of your li!e. I've done all of them myself. 
Many of these exercises tell you to take a passage of such-and-such a length and work some kind of 
transformation on it. Whole pauage should it be, your own or someone else's? Either; or rather, both. 
You can leam diHererlt things by doll\g the exerdJe diHererlt ways. If a piece of your own writing Is still 
fresh enough In your mind so that you can ,eu_1ber what problems you were trying to solve as you 
wrote it, the exper!eiIce of working comp1etely arbitrary changes on it can be exhilarating, not unlike 
setting dollar billa on fire. 
[§36. MARY-CLAIRE'S HANDOUT ON COMPOSITlON EXERCISES

[82 
Vocabulary: 
I .  Replace. 
Take a passage five pages long and replac:e at least three words in every sentence with others 
that rrean approximately the same thing. (- "Get into your hands a 1500-word portion of a 
written work and swap out of every sentence a minimum of three words, substituting others 
without changing what's being said." - "Select a longish section from something you've 
been reading and change the vocabulary of every sentence without changing the 
signification.") 
2. Multiply. 
Choose a word and write a thesaurus enny for it - all the words at every level of diction that 
mean approximately the sarre thing. Compare your enny to the entries in which the word 
actually appears in some real thesaurus. 
Most writers like to have several good desk dictionaries and at least one good thesaurus. In addition, 
you might llke • book by Slclney 4ndau called DictioMria. It has helped me understand how 
dictionaries and thesawwes get made and thus how to use them better. 
Syntax: 
t. Transform. 
Take . passage of five pages and transform every sentence so that it says approximately the 
same thing in different syntax. Change the vocabulary as little as possible. (_ 'Taking a 
five-page passage, transform every sentence to say .n approximation of the same thing in 
different syntax." - "Can you transform every sentence in a passage of five pages so that 
approximately the same thing gets said in different syntax?") 
2. Build tight parallels. 
Write a sentence containing a tight parallel: • pair of structures that match perfectly in the 
number and kind of aU their parts .nd subordinate structures. Push yourself till you can 
construct sentences that contain tight parallels in which sch member is fifteen or twenty 
words long. 
3. Be periodic. 
Rewrite a non-periodk sentence or pair of sentences as a periodic sentence. (A periodic 
sentence is one whote gruNNtical and physical ends coincide - one with no adverbials to 
the right of the preclIcate. The flnt sentence in this paragraph is non-periodic; a periodic 
venion might read: "Rewrite as a periodic sentence a non-periodic sentence or pair of 
sentences.") Write an entire paragraph in periodic sentences; an entire page. 
4. Eulphasize. 
Reast a sentence so as to express the same meurlng but emphasize a different point. 
S. Write nonsense. 
Write a paragraph of coherent, tightly structurecl nonsense - all the connectives and labels in 
place, but n9 �ing. (M.de-up words not allowed.) 
§36.  MARY-CLAIRE'S HANDOUT ON COMPOSITION EXERCISES I 
Manual labor: 
1.  Copy I. 
Copy out a passage of your own writing or someone else's with a pen; with a pencil; with a 
crayon; first with your left hand and then with your right; with a manual typewriter; with a 
word-processor. 
2. Copy II. 
Copy out a passage from somethillg you lil<e; from something you dislil<e; from something 
you find difficult to read; from something you find laughably easy; from someone you'd like 
to imitate; from someone completely unlike you; from something written a hundred years 
ago; from somethillg written last year; from somethillg scrawled off in haste; from something 
overwritten and finicky. 
The first of these copying exercises Is exploratory and interesting, and I certainly recommend that you do 
it, but the second is is in another class altogether. Copying as a means of close reading is an inexhaustible 
source of information. Word-processing has temporarily confused writers about the connection between 
their hands and their brains. What you do with your hands Is the easy part. Use It to support the hard 
part. The hard part which is what you do with your brain. 
Frozen sounds: 
1 .  Transcribe. 
Make a tape recording of five minutes of raello news and transcribe it. Transcribe five 
minutes of a publlc lecture; five minute. of dialog from a television show; five minutes of 
ordinary convelMtion among tluee o� four people. Talk extemporaneously into a tape 
recorder fo� five minutes and traNaibe that. 
2. Usten. 
Read aloud a page of your own writing. Ask a friend of yours to read it aloud. Ask a second 
friend. Ask a stranger. 
Learn to mutter aloud what you're writing as you write it. It's only a minor eccentricity, and there's no 
more efficient way of checking tor both cadence and tone. 
[§36. MARY-CLAIRE'S HANDOUT ON COMPOSITION EXERCISES 83) 
[84 
Marks on paper: 
1. Close your eyes. 
Compose a paragraph with your eyes shut. Start over again from the beginning on a fresh 
piece of paper as often as you like, but don't peek. 
2. Tabulate. 
Write a sentence with two conditionals ("If it rains and if Peter arrives on time ... "); rewrite it 
as a table. Write a paragraph with several linlced conditionals; rewrite it as a table. 
3. Caption. 
De9c:ribe a picture in a single line that fits under the picture exactly; in two lines that fit 
under the picture exactly. 
Stance, voice, and tone:

Choose two words at random from a dictionary and write a sentence that uses both of them; 
choose three words at random and do the same. 
2. Categorize. 
Take twenty nouns at random from a dictionary and arrange them in categories. Write an 
explanation of your scheme for arranging them. 
Usually we don't need to do pure invention; we start from something, even if it's only "What I Did on My 
Summer Vacation." Much of learning a discipline is learning how to do invention - how to recognize the 
kinds of ideas that malce that discipline go forward and how to get yourself into position to have such 
ideas yourself. 
Another part of learning a discipline is learning what you don't have to invent because it's already been 
done for you. The lonN lor taking advantage of that bacl,log of ideas vary from one discipline to 
another, but the underlying habits of thought are simllar. The best set of exercises I have ever seen on 
those habits is at the end of the section called "External Aids to Invention" in Edward P.J. Corbett's

3. Explode. 
Take a piece of metric vene and expand every line by one foot without altering the meaning 
- from tetramell!r to pentameter, for instance, or from pentameter to hexameter. 
Verse-writing is to other compoaition exercises what lifting hundred-pound weights is to touching your 
toes. But you must honor conventional rhyme and stresa in order to get the benefit of writing verse; 
otherwise you'll cheat yourself by writing near misses. For help on words lllce "villanelle" and 
"heumeter: get a prosody handbook; get John Hollander'S, and you'll find yourself reading it for fun.

§37. Excerpts from class, November 30 [notes by PMR] 
During the whole of a dull, darlc, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, 
when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been pa .... ing alone, 
on hor .  ebaclc, through a singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found 
myself, a .. the shade .. of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy Terman 
Engineering building. 
-E. A. Poe (amended) 
Don, like Mary-Claire, scans the pages of The New Yorker for choice malapropisms to 
entertain us. In its columns the law firm of Choate, Hall, & Stewart had been rendered 
as Choate, Hall, Ampersand, and Stewart, presumably by a journalist receiving dictation 
over the telephone. 
We also saw a splendid dangling participle from the same source: 
"Flavor and texture of cooked okra are different from other vegetables. We usually 
don't eat it raw, but in judging at fairs, I frequently taste a slice of a pod to check 
maturity and condition. In soups, it is used as a thickening agent. When fried, I 
love okra." 
[When sober, can't stand the stuff. -The New Yorker] 
Don announced that he had good news and bad news for us. He gave us the good news 
first. Mary-Claire is to speak again on Wednesday. Also, Don finally got up the courage 
to ask Paul Halmos to appear in our guest spot; he readily agreed and will speak next 
Wednesday (9th December). This talk should be a fitting climax to the course. And a 
week from today (Monday, 7th December) we will hear from Rosalie Sterner, a copy-editor 
for The San Francisco Chronicle. 
Having thus softened us up with these cheerful tidings, Don delivered the Bad News: The 
first drafts of the term papers were, well . . .  "their content was not one hundred percent 
pleasing to your instructor." What makes a professor's life worthwhile? The knowledge 
that he has succeeded in teaching something. In particular, there's a joy in the thought that 
a student was able to do something that he couldn't have managed without the professor's 
help. Don confessed that this joy did not run through him as he read our drafts. Indeed, 
he could almost think that many of them were written before the class started. Have we 
been relaxing too much, he wondered? Has our writing in fact changed at all? Have we 
learnt nothing? Disturbing thoughts, he said. 
Of the thirteen papers submitted, eleven were sprinkled with wicked whiches-at least two 
in each. Don himself has been guilty of these in his time, and of course there is no-one like 
a convert for rooting out heresy. But these are the 80s and we are supposed to be sensitised 
to these things. And heaven knows, we've talked about this issue enough in class! So what 
is he to think about this landslide of carelessness? Shaking his head, Don declared that 
we left him with no alternative-he would have to resort to the ultimate sanction: a quiz. 
In keeping with Honor Code protocols, Don left the room while we each wrote· a sen­
tence that used a 'that' correctly where a 'which' would have been wrong, and another 
(§3i· COMMENTS ON STUDENT WORK 
[90 
complementary sentence-which used a 'which' correctly where a 'that' would ha\'e been 
incorrect. A minute passed. And then another minute. There was little to hear but the 
scratching of pencils and the beating of hearts .  
Don returned. We spent a few minutes looking at  the various examples that the class had 
come up with, some correct and some incorrect. By and large, the class redeemed itself by 
the creative solutions that were submitted: 
All the students that know when to use 'which' and 'that' will pass the quiz. The 
exam, which took place at the beginning of class, was not difficult. 
A paper that uses two whiches improperly does not demonstrate that the author 
hasn't learned anything. My first draft , which was written this summer, had a 
million of them. 
Beware of examples that are misleading. My term paper, which contains many 
wicked whiches, is otherwise not too bad. 
CS-types just love self-reference, it seems. 
Is it not true, TLL asked of Mary-Claire, that people invariably get their whiches and 
thats right when they speak? Mary-Claire replied that people almost never say 'which' 
improperly in general speech-it's only when they feel under pressure that they resort to 
this unnatural diction. So unnecessary use of 'which' really conveys a bad tone in your 
writing; it makes you sound nervous. ( Conversely, on paper we can often fool our audience 
into thinking that we are a lot more comfortable than we really are). 
Don observed that all translations of the Bible are strewn with erroneous whiches. ( "Thou 
shalt not llUffer a wicked which to live," he might have said.) A clamour of voices pointed 
out that Fowler is quite clear about the rule. True, but it was never enforced until the late 
iDs, Don countered. It seems particularly strange, he said, that the New English Bible 
should commit this error, as its editors take great pride in the literary qualities of their 
text. Mary-Claire resolved this mystery: Apparently our "oldest and closest allies" on that 
far-off island regard this whole issue as unmitigated nonsense! 
Don made a final plea to us: "You all keep your text online, so it's very very easy to locate 
all your whiches and check them. Please don't cause your instructor any more pain on this 
score!" 
Sneaky Don had saved one more item of good news to lighten our spirits after this depress­
ing interlude: A letter from Leonard Gillman, editor of the Seirpinski proof over which we 
had laboured many moons ago. Professor Gillman was fulsome in his praise of our sugges­
tions, and is now working on an improved write up. Particular credit went to Student B, 
of course. Gillman is an Emeritus Professor as of three months ago-Don drools to think 
of all the free time he must have. 
We moved on. Don claimed to have discovered a new (?) rule only by seeing it broken in 
three of the papers he read. It is this: The text should make sense if we read through it 
omitting the titles of subsections. So, for example, don't say: 
2.  Contour Integration. This technique, invented by Cauchy, is used . . .  
§37,  COMMENTS ON STUDENT \\'o n t-: '  
Rather, say: 
2. Contour Integration. The technique of integrating along curves in the 
complex plane, invented by Cauchy, is used . . .  
The point is that the subheading should not be referred to explicitly or regarded as an 
"integral" part of the text. Think of it as some kind of marginal note or meta-level 
comment. 
We spent the rest of the time looking at the draft of a paper about graph theory written 
by Ramsey Haddad and Alex Schaffer. Firstly, Don pointed to their careful attention to 
definitions. This is particularly important in graph theory as various authors use terms 
inconsistently. A path may or may or not be the same thing as a simple path. At least 
one writer uses the term walk to make a distinction here. So it is necessary to define one's 
graph theory terms clearly right at the start , even the most basic ones. Remarkably, there 
was a time when the symbol ' = '  was not in general use. Fermat never used it, preferring 
always to write ';eq' or 'ad;eq' or fuller Latin words like 'ad;equibantur' that these terms 
abbreviate. So in those days you would have to define the symbol ' = '  at the beginning of 
your article if you intended to use it. (The equals sign was invented by Robert Recorde 
in his Whetstone of Witte, 1557, but it did not come into general use until more than a 
hundred years later. Descartes used ' = '  to mean something completely different. )  The 
moral: Ask yourself what background your readers share, and what they may or may not 
have in common. "Be aware of what's diverse in your readership" . 
We saw a somewhat intimidating multi-part definition. It would become less formidable 
to the reader if shortened. In this particular case, the expression 
could have been condensed to 
since W2 is used nowhere else. (In the Haddad-Schaffer paper, ' . '  means 'zero or more' 
and ' + '  means 'one or more', but let's not worry about that here. )  Try to be succinct, 
said Don: "Less is more." 
It is important to be consistent in your use of terms, and you need to be especially careful 
about this when working with co-authors. In this paper, one writer talked about 'dom­
inators' and the other about 'parents" referring to the same concept. (Freudian slip? ) 
A related issue: Don't define terms that you never use. Don recalled Feynman's complaint 
about New Maths: you are taught the symbols n and U in second grade, but you don't 
use them in any nontrivial way for seven years. 
Next came a tricky question of tenses. "Gabow and Tarjan[Gab83] show that for many 
algorithms that had such a multiplicative factor in their worst-case complexities, the mul­
tiplicative term can be removed." Here 'had' should be 'have'; an algorithm lives forever, 
and its worst-case complexity is a timeless fact about it. However, the problem · solved 
by an algorithm can have different known complexities at different times; therefore 'had' 
[§37 .  COMMENTS ON STUDENT WORK 9 1  
[92 
would be okay if 'algorithms' were 'problems' .  (The quoted sentence also exhibits other 
anomalies. A 'multiplicative factor' is not also a 'multiplicative term' ;  factors are multi­
plied, terms are added. Also the logic of the sentence can be unwound to make the point 
clearer: "Gabow and Tarjan have shown how to impro";e the algorithms by removing such 
a multiplicative factor from the worst-case complexities in many cases [Gab83j ." ) 
We talked about abbreviations for bibliographic references. Don didn't like the lack of 
space before the bracket in " . . .  Tarjan[Gab83j . . .  " ;  neither does he like this kind of thing: 
"In [Smith 80) it was shown . . .  " .  References should ideally be parenthetical; we should be 
able to read the sentence ignoring them and still have it make sense (cf. subheadings) .  Some 
citation styles write up names and dates in full, but this can get repetitious: " . . .  Knuth 
[Knuth83) has shown that . . .  " .  Don's paper on goto's was published first in ACM Com· 
puting Surveys and later incorporated into a book. For this second printing he had to 
make numerous changes to the sentences containing citations, because the originals would 
look strange in the different context and format of the book. Oren Patashnik pointed out 
that the Chigaco Manual of Style recommends that you don't number references, lest you 
have to make changes all through the text every time you insert a new one. This is less of 
an issue when a system like TEX handles such things automatically, of course. The CMS 
is full of such efficiency tips. 
Too many commas can be a bad thing (bad things?).  For example, consider this sentence: 
"Our algorithm to recognize and label the graphs when given a directed graph, G ,  with 
distinguished vertex s ,  can be summarized as follows." Remove the commas around 'G '  
and put one after 'graphs'. A s  a rough guide, put a comma where a speaker would pause 
to draw breath. 
The word "loop" was ambiguous when first used; Don replaced it by "self-loop " .  
A sentence in the paper began "If any Hi (j > 0 )  h as  . . .  " .  In fact i t  was known that Ho 
satisfies the stated condition, so Don suggested that the authors simplify the statement by 
omitting the j > 0 condition. Moral: Give a simple rule rather than an optimal one. 
Elsewhere we saw " . . .  all the Hi 's . . .  " .  This is of course the standard way to form 
the plural of a symbol, but you are going to get into trouble when you start also using 
the construct Hj (that is, Hi primed).  A simple way to avoid the problem is just to 
say: " . . .  each Hi is . .  , " .  Alternatively, you might want to invent another name for the 
concept, particularly if you are going to be using it time and time again. It's just not 
elegant to have too many symbols crowded on the page. At one point the authors wrote 
" . . .  of HiS descendants . . .  " .  This doesn't work at all; you do need an apostrophe for the 
genitive (possessive) case. 
Three small points: 
Instead of " . . .  the one vertex path . . .  " ,  write " . . .  the one-vertex path . . .  " . 
The preposition 'at' would be better than 'of' in " . . .  vertex of distance < d . , .  " . 
We certainly need a space here: " . . .  using 4.3(below) we derive . . .  " . 
Some authors have a disconcerting habit of using a lemma or theorem that is not proved 
until later on in the book. This can leave the reader wondering whether someone hasn't 
§ 37 . COMMENTS ON STUDENT WORK) 
pulled a fast one on him (essentially by using a result to prove that same resul t ) .  So make 
it quite clear to the reader that your proof structures do respect the necessary partial 
ordering. 
U sing ties: 'lEX and other systems allow you to specify that certain blanks are not to 
be used as line breaks. For example, put ties after the word 'dominates' in the phrase 
' v  dominates x and x dominates w '. In " . . .  if e is . . .  " it is best to put such a tie 
between e and 'is'. The idea is to keep line breaks from interrupting or distorting the 
message. 
Beware of the unfortunate co-incidence! Sometimes we cannot use an idiom because some 
word is also being used in another sense. For example: " . . .  n vertices have been deleted 
by this point ."  In one of the term papers, someone was using contour integration to study 
aerodynamics. There were airplanes and complex planes all over the place, much to Don's 
confusion. Another example that came up was the word 'left' .  This can be either left as 
against right (in a tree structure, say), or a past tense of the verb 'to leave'. So 'the node .T 
is left ' might be ambiguous. 
In a final remark for today, Don suggested that a sequence of examples that build upon 
one another is much more useful than a number of unrelated ones. The paper by Haddad 
and Schiiffer has a particularly nice sequence of illustrations demonstrating this point. 
After class, everyone got back two independently annotated copies of their term papers. 
§38. Excerpts from class, December 2 [notes by TLL] 
Don welcomed Mary-Claire van Leunen to her encore lecture by pointing out the intriguing 
books that Mary-Claire had placed on the desk; he said that he hoped that she could now 
tell us all the things that the clock had prevented her from telling us last lecture. Mary­
Claire countered by saying that Don had only invited her back "on the theory that no one 
could possibly be that nervous two weeks in a row." 
Leaving the books alone for the moment, Mary-Claire told us the tale of which and that. 
The story opens in the 17th century, when speakers of English have two relative pronouns: 
which and that. What are relative pronouns? Here are some sentences (exanlples taken 
from the Concise Oxford Dictionary) where which and that are used as relative pronouns, 
both singular and plural: 
Our Father which art in Heaven . . .  . 
These are the ones which I want to learn . 
. . . the one that I mean . . .  
These are the ones that I want to learn. 
Which and that are not always used as relative pronouns. Here are some sentences (again 
from the Concise Oxford) where they serve other functions (along with the technical term 
for the function they are serving) :  
Which? Say which. 
Which one? Say which one. 
(interrogative pronoun) 
(interrogative adjective)

We have no spoken evidence from the 17th century, but Language Theorists believe that 
writing and speech were very far apart. That is, they believe that no one's ideal was 
to write the way that he sounded. Theorists cite two pieces of evidence to support this 
claim: The first is that the Theorists themselves find it difficult to believe that, in the last 
three centuries, spoken English has evolved as fast as it must have if the written language 
and the spoken language originally matched. The second piece of evidence comes from 
examining extant 17th century guidelines on writing or speaking effectively. 
By examining samples of writing from the 19th century (particularly the everyday writing 
that was used for communication rather than as examples of great literature), we can see 
that the written language has evolved into one much closer to the spoken language. Lan­
guage Theoreticians of that time said that this evolution was good, but their admonitions 
came after the direction of evolution was already evident. (We should remember that our 
language belongs to millions of people. It cannot be controlled by the decrees of any one 
person or group.) We now move on to our own century. 
In 1906 H. W. Fowler and F. G. Fowler published The King's English (Oxford University 
Press still has it in print) .  Here the brothers Fowler write down for the first time that 
conversational rhythms are to be reflected in written English. 
In 1926 H. W. Fowler published Modern English Usage (also still available from Oxford 
University Press). In this book the surviving brother continues the explanation of the 
relationship between spoken and written English-but he does so much more clearly. 
While we are following the hot trail of our current subject, we should not lose sight of the 
vast range of the contributions that Fowler made in this landmark book. Mary-Claire calls 
Fowler the "great theoretician of the semicolon." Fowler saw the semicolon, which has no 
spoken equivalent, as a structuring device that operates between the levels of the sentence 
and the paragraph. This is just one example of how Fowler tried to utilize the graphical 
nature of print to the advantage of written English. 
Returning to the evolution of written English toward spoken English, let's examine how 
people use which and that when they talk. 
Speakers do not use which as a relative pronoun because speakers do not normally express 
thoughts that are long enough to contain non-restrictive clauses: OUI spoken sentences 
are shorter than our written ones. People do use which when they talk, but they use 
non-referential whiches to introduce new thoughts that are tacked on to old thoughts.  
Examples of this kind of usage seem strange when written down (because we don't use 
non-referential whiches in written English), but they sound perfectly normal when heard 
§38 .  MARY-CLAlRE VAN LEUNEN ON WHICH VS. THAT] 
on the street. Here is one: 
I went sailing this weekend; which tells you why my nose is pink. 
Fowler realized that written English would sound more like speech if the choice of relative 
pronoun was uniquely determined by whether or not the clause it introduced was restrictive 
or non-restrictive. He wrote several thousand words on this subject; here are a few of them: 
A supposed, and misleading, distinction is that 'that' is the colloquial and 'which' 
the literary relative. That is a false inference from an actual but misinterpreted 
fact.  It is a fact that the proportion of 'that's to 'which's is far higher in speech 
than in writing; but the reason is not that the spoken 'that's are properly con­
verted into written 'which's. It is that the kind of clause properly begun with 
'which' is rare in speech with its short detached sentences, but very common in 
the more complex and continuous structure of writing, while the kind properly 
begun with 'that' is equally necessary in both. This false inference, however, 
tends to verify itself by persuading the writers who follow rules of thumb actually 
to change the original 'that' of their thoughts into a 'which' for presentation in 
print. 
The two kinds of relative clause, to one of which 'that' and to the other of which 
'which' is appropriate, are the defining and the non-defining; and if writers would 
agree to regard 'that' as the defining .relative pronoun, and 'which' as the non­
defining, there would be much gain both in lucidity and in ease. Some there 
are who follow this principle now; but it would be idle to pretend that it is the 
practice either of most or of the best writers. 
There is no doubt that Fowler has had a significant influence on the English language. but 
why is it that his effect on American English has been greater than on British English? 
To answer that question, we move our focus to New York in the year 1925: Harold Ross 
has just founded the New Yorker magazine. 
Ross was a man who liked things to be clearly defined. He took Modern English Usage as 
gospel. For decades the New Yorker had reliably influential prose, and for decades H. W. 
Fowler's dictums were applied blindly to that prose. Mary-Claire was nearly nonplused as 
she mentioned reading a collection of letters from a New Yorker editor to various literary 
luminaries. ( "I'm sorry, but we had to change all your whiches to thats," sounds rather 
presumptuous when addressed to John Updike.) The New Yorker no longer treats Fowler 
as divinely inspired, and they haven't since the 1950s, but that leaves close to three decades 
of blind obedience to consider. 
According to Mary-Claire, Harold Ross's attachment to obedience is not unusual-for 
Americans. She says that Americans look in a reference work, see what it says, and then 
decide to obey or to disobey; Britishers look in the same reference, see what it says, and 
then formulate new and different ways of treating the same questions. Why is it that 
Britishers feel that they are entitled to an opinion but Americans do not? Two··partial 
answers might combine to give us a single satisfactory one.

Most British people have been English speakers for generations, but most Americans are 
descendants of recent immigrants. Immigrants are told, "These are the facts. If you want 
to speak English, follow the rules ."  Perhaps more important, educated British people are 
taught to write from day one. Many of the exercises that Mary-Claire gave us in her lecture 
on Calisthenics are actually used in British Grammar Schools. British University students 
discuss their weekly writing with their tutors-and they regularly write about 2000 words 
a week. 
In 1957, we Americans acquired a new source of authority on writing English-this time 
American English. An old classmate of E. B. White's sent him a copy of the book that they 
had received from their English professor, Will Strunk. The decision-makers at Macmillan 
decided to publish a book that contained Strunk's monograph plus an extra chapter by 
White on "spiritual things." The combination of Strunk's clear and simple instructions 
and White's beautiful prose made The Elements of Style, by William Strunk, Jr . . and 
E. B. White, the landmark of written style for our generation. Here is their entire essay 
on which and that: 
"That" is the defining or restrictive pronoun, "which" the non-defining or non­
restrictive. See under Rule 3. 
The lawn mower that is broken is in the garage. (Tells which one.)  
The lawn mower, which is  broken, is  in the garage. (Adds a fact about 
the only mower in question.) 
Rule 3 says "Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas." 
Mary-Claire has a copy of the first edition of The Elements of Style, in which White uses 
a 'which' for a 'that' (this has been changed in later editions) .  The line originally read: 
. . .  a coinage of his own which he felt was similar to . . .  
The Elements of Style has many departures from guidelines presented by Fowler. It was 
written for the American audience, and it was written for an audience without a high level 
of grammatical sophistication. In contrast, as Mary-Claire said, "Fowler is rough going 
for those of us whose Latin is weak and whose Greek is non-existent." Future editions of 
Fowler may need prefaces explaining what adjectives, adverbs, and the like are. It is most 
common for people to learn those terms when they learn their first non-native language 
(though Latin is the only language to which the terms are perfectly suited) .  
Fortunately for native English speakers, there is  a rule completely lacking in jargon that 
we can use to determine whether a 'which' should be a 'that' :  
If you can substitute 'that' for 'which', do it. 
Mary-Claire attributed this rule to Leslie Lamport. Leslie says that his version of the rule 
is actually: 
If it sounds all right to replace a 'which' by a 'that ' ,  then Strunk & White say 
replace it. 
§ 38 .  MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON WHICH V·S. TlI.·I ! '  
Which brings us to our next issue: Are whiches that could be thats always wrong? Don said 
that now that he knows the rules, he finds every "wicked which" an irritating distraction 
from his reading enjoyment . He seemed to imply that whiches in restrictive clauses are 
always wrong. 
Mary-Claire said that the rules given hold for "everyday, expository prose-shirtsleeve 
prose, not literary prose." (She did not tell us how to decide when the everyday rules 
should be violated.) As for Don's discomfort on finding whiches in well-beloved authors, 
she said "I believe we are encountering obedience here." After class, Leslie Lamport had 
this to say on the same subject: 
I unfortunately have somewhat the same reaction as Don to "incorrect" uses of 
which, for which I curse the evil influence of Strunk & White. When I observed 
that writers such as Dickens and Fowles are "incorrect," I quickly lost my desire 
to be "correct ." However, I can't completely unlearn the reflex of being bothered 
by the "incorrect" usage. 
I still try to use thats when Strunk & White tells me to, because I know that 
many of my readers will have been similarly indoctrinated. But I will throw in 
an occasional wicked which to avoid a string of thats. 
Mary-Claire's final word on the subject: 
" Which and that are not in themselves very important. But tone is important, 
and tone consists entirely of making these tiny, tiny choices. If you make enough 
of these them wrong-choices like which versus that-then you won't get your 
maximum readership. The reader who has to read the stuff will go on reading 
it, but with less attention, less commitment than you want. And the reader who 
doesn't have to read will stop."

[98 
§39. Excerpts from class, December 2 (continued) [notes by TLL] 
During the final moments of class, Mary-Claire finally got to those intriguing books. They 
were worth waiting for. 
First, she reminded us of "Franklin's Exercise" from her previous lecture. She read us a 
passage from The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin where Franklin mentions it: 
A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me, of the 
propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their abilities for study. 
He was of opinion that it was improper, and that they were naturally unequal to 
it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a little for dispute's sake. He was naturally 
more eloquent , had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore 
me down more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted 
without settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some time, 
I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent to him. 
He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of a side had passed, when 
my father happened to find my papers and read them. Without entering into 
the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing; 
observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling 
and pointing (which I ow'd to the printing-house) ,  I fell far short in elegance of 
expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several 
instances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew more attentive to the 
manner in writing, and determined to endeavor an improvement. 
About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. 
I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was 
much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, 
to imitate it.  With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints 
of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without 
looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each 
hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any 
suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with 
the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found I 
wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I 
thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; 
since the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, 
to suit the measure, or of different sound for rhyme, would have laid me under 
a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fix that 
variety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales 
and turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten 
the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of 
hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the 
best order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. 
This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing my 
work afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and amended them; 
but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in certain �articulars of small 
§39 . MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON CALlSTHE.'1[CS (i I )  
import, I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language, and this 
encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English 
writer, of which I was extreamly ambitious. 
Next, she reminded us of the verse-writing exercises that she had so highly recommended 
during the previous lecture. She showed us the book that she and her student, Steven 
Astrachan, had worked through together: A Prosody Handbook, by Shapiro and Beum. 
She said what would have been even better was Rhyme's Reason by John Hollander. 
Mary-Claire said we should all buy Hollander's book, and then she tried to make sure we 
would by playing on the Computer Scientist's love of self-reference. This is Hollander's 
description of one particular poetic form: 
This form wi th two refrains in parallel? 
(J  ust watch the opening and the third line.)  
The repeti tions build the villanelle. 
The subject established, it can swell 
across the poet-architect's design: 
This form with two refrains in parallel 
Must never make them jingle like a bell, 
Tuneful but empty, boring and benign; 
The repetitions build the villanelle 
By moving out beyond the tercet's cell 
(Though having two lone rhyme-sounds can confine 
This form). With two refrains in parallel 
A poem can find its way into a hell 
Of ingenuity to redesign 
the repetitions. Build the villanelle 
Till it has told the tale it has to tell; 
Then two refrains will fu).ally intertwine. 
This form with two refrains in parallel 
The repetitions build: The Villanelle, 
Mary-Claire told us that she once wrote out a recipe for making bagels in Alexandrine 
couplets. It was a good exercise, and it was hard. She says that it was so hard that she 
actually began to believe that the results would be intelligible (and interesting) to someone 
else. She sent the recipe off to a food magazine and received "a truly astounded letter of 
rejection." She cautioned us again that the verse exercises, useful as they are, "really are 
only exercises."  
The final book that she showed us was A Handlist of Rhetorjcal Terms, by Richard A.  
Lanham. She said Lanham is the source for many of the great words she dazzles people 
with. Some of the terms in Lanham's book are more useful than others; there are some 
terms in the book that can only be represented in Greek syllabic verse. 
Mary-Claire and Steven wrote out examples of each term in Lanham's book. Having 
performed the exercise, Mary-Claire confidently told us that it was not profitable. She 
[§39 . MARY-CLAIRE VAN LEUNEN ON CALISTHENICS (2) 99] 
[ 1 00 
said that her warning us not to try exercises that won't do us any good proves that she 
isn't totally crazy-and that the exercises that she did give us are worth doing. 
§40' Excerpts from class, December 4 [notes by P MR] 
"All the officer patients in the ward were forced to censor letters written by all 
the enlisted-men patients, who were kept in residence in wards of their own. It 
was a monotonous job, and Yossarian was disappointed to learn that the lives of 
enlisted men were only slightly more interesting than the lives of officers. After 
the first day he had no curiosity at all. To break the monotony, he invented 
games. Death to all modifiers, he declared one day, and out of every letter that 
passed through his hands went every adverb and every adjective. The next day he 
made war on articles. He reached a much higher plane of creativity the following 
day when he blacked everything in the letters but a, an and the. That erected 
more dynamic intralinear tensions, he felt ,  and in just about every case left a 
message far more universal." 
- from Catcn-22 by Joseph Heller 
Don rewarded today's early birds with the chance to participate in a referendum. We 
voted to decide the due-date for the term papers, Monday 14th or Wednesday 16th . UN 
observers were not surprised to find the latter date was favoured by the populace; the only 
surpcise was that the vote was not quite unanimous. Very well then, said Don: All papers 
to b, h nded to him, his secretary or TA's, by 5pm (Pacific Standard Time) on Wednesday 
16" - ·ember. (The real early birds were rewarded with some cookies that Sherry was 
har.( ' . ··Jund. And very good they were too). 
It \Va.; course too much to hope that we could get through the whole of a CS class 
wi tho\.: .·omputers rearing their ugly heads; today they did. Don's topic was computer 
prograus that are supposed to help us with our writing. Two such-style and dict ion­
are available on Navajo (a CSD Unix machine). These are relatively old programs. State­
of-the-art systems cost a lot of money, and so naturally Stanford doesn't have them. There 
is a program called sexist, for example, which attempts to alert us to controversial word 
usage. Don recalled the occasion when the (London) Times quoted him as saying that it 
wasn't appropriate to talk about 'mother and daughter' nodes in a tree structure, and he 
received a lot of irate mail as a result. People seem to be less uptight about such things 
these days, he said_ 
The style program takes a piece of text and scores it according to 'readability'. The 
analysis is very superficial-way below the level of human critiquing. However, said Don, 
these programs are kind of fun. And they do provide an excuse to read the document 
from another point of view. Even if the analysis is wrong it does prompt you to re-read 
your prose, and this has to be a good thing. Don recalled Richard Feynman's anecdote 
about his first day at Oak Ridge Laboratories: Having no idea what he was supposed to 
be doing, Feynman pointed to a random symbol in the blueprints and said, "What about 
this then?" A technician immediately agreed that Feynman had spotted a significant and 
potentially dangerous oversight in the design. 
§40. COMPUTER AIDS TO WRITl.W; ] 
To illustrate the programs, Don had run them on a dozen or so sample texts. For instance, 
he used a passage from the rather ponderous introduction to a book by Alonzo Church; 
samples of PMR's and TLL's notes for CS 209; versions of his own exposition of binomial 
coefficients, vintage 1965 and 1985; vVuthering Heights ; Grimm 's Fairy Tales; and part 
of a book about the Bible that Don is writing on weekends. The style routine produces 
four different readability grades for any piece of text. Each is literally a "grade" in that 
it indicates what level of education the piece suggests. The basis of the grading is very 
straightforward; it's a linear formula whose variables are the average number of syllables 
(or letters) per word and the average number of words per sentence (or sometimes the 
reciprocal of this value). For example, there are constants Q ,  {3, l' such that 
grade = Q (words/sentence) + {3 (syllables/word) + 1' .  
How were Q ,  {3 ,  and l' determined? The authors of each readability index simply look at 
a large number of pieces of writing and assign them a grade-level 'by eye'-that is, they 
estimate the age of the intended reader. Each piece of text is then characterised by three 
real numbers: the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables 
per word, and the subjective grade level. So each piece determines a single point in 3-space 
(plotted against three orthogonal axes) ;  the set of pieces determines a scatter of points in 
3-space. Standard linear regression techniques are used to find the plane that is the "best 
fit" for these points .  The three parameters above define this plane. 
Someone asked whether we should be shooting for some specific grade level, and if so, what 
level? Don replied that his usual aim is to minimise the level, although overdoing this will 
defeat the purpose. 
In addition to the raw scores, a variety of other parameters come out of a style analysis: 
average length of sentences, percentage of sentences that are much shorter or longer than 
the average, percentage of sentences that begin with various parts of speech, etc. The 
program also attempts to classify sentences into types and tabulate their frequencies, as well 
as telling us the percentages of nouns, adjectives, verbs (active or passive), etc. A sentence 
is considered "passive" if a passive verb appears in it anywhere, even in a subclause. 
Curiously, style classifies any sentence that begins 'It . . .  ' or 'There . . .  ' as an "expletive." 
This seems a little strange to those of us who are old enough to remember Watergate. We 
always thought that it was quite a different class of words that the transcribers of Tricky 
Dicky's tapes felt the need to delete. 
Don's theological piece stood out as being pitched at a significantly lower grade level than 
the other specimens. He was initially surprised by this, and double checked the data 
to make sure there was no mistake. But on reflection he concluded that we usually write 
more obscurely when writing about our own field. The two versions of his binomial chapter 
had very similar scores, despite their having been written twenty years apart. Church's 
piece scored high. Don said that the statistics were misleading here; although Church's 
sentences are quite long, they are not ugly but musical. Still they were not a special joy 
for the reader. 
The style output also noted a lot of passive voice in Church (perh'l-ps not surprising in a 
[§40. COMPUTER AIDS TO WRITING 101 ] 
[ 1 02 
technical work) and a paucity of adjectives in Grimm's Fairy Tales. Don noted that Mark 
Twain didn't think much of adjectives either. 
A companion program called diction operates on different lines. It has an internal dic­
tionary of 450 words and phrases that it deems 'questionable' and flags them, inviting the 
writer to find an alternative way to express himself. For example, diction doesn't like 
the word 'gratuitous' ,  and flags its use as an error. Neither does it like the phrases 'num­
ber of' or 'due to'. Don noted that copy editors generally prefer 'because of' to 'due to' 
in ordinary writing, and perhaps diction is overlooking the mathematical usage: "This 
theorem, due to Cauchy, is used . . .  " .  In Don's book TEX: The Program, the copy-editor 
changed all Don's 'due to's to 'owing to'; Don changed them all back again. But he 
searched unsuccessfully for a reference to the mathematical usage in his dictionaries, so 
he wondered aloud if he was completely out of line with the rest of the world. The class 
unanimously reassured him that ' due to' was quite the elegant way to give credit for a 
scientific innovation. Lexicographers are out of touch here. 
The word 'very' is also on dict ion's list of suspects. Don recalled that someone had once 
advised him thus: "Try changing all your 'very's to 'damn's and see what results. Don't 
use 'very' unless you would happily use 'damn' in its place." Damn good advice! 
The diction filter also objected to 'literally' and 'in fact', but partially redeemed itself by 
catching a wicked 'which'. A sister program, explain, expands on diction's objections 
and recommends improvements. For example, explain suggests that we write 'if' instead 
of 'assuming that', and 'really' instead of 'actually'. In practice, users reportedly accept 
about 50% of diction's suggestions. And that's as it should be-we've got to keep these 
machines in their place. 
§41.  Excerpts from class, December 7 [notes by PMRj 
Today we heard from our penultimate guest speaker, Rosalie Sterner. Rosalie is a wire 
features editor at the San Francisco Chronicle, teaches copy editing at Berkeley, and has 
worked as a copy editor for the San Francisco Chronicle, the Kansas City Star, and Chicago 
Daily News. So she wields an ultimate pen. 
It's a sad truth, Rosalie said, that people who should be able to write well often can't. She 
illustrated with a newspaper headline: 
DISABLED FLY TO SEE CARTER 
and a story that began: "Doing what he loved best, golf pro John Smith died while . . .  " .  
She told us about the occasion when · a newspaper was having trouble fitting the word 
'psychiatrist' into a headline, and resolved the problem simply by writing 'dentist' instead. 
Rosalie went through a story filed by an experienced journalist, pointing out its good and 
bad features and the changes she had made. 
"Nine out of ten books bought in this century by the U.S.  Library of Congress, one 
of the gre
'
at research libraries of the world, will self-destruct in ao to 50 years." 
§41 . ROSALIE STEMER ON COpy EDITING) 
She faulted this sentence on a number of counts. The 'great research libraries' phrase 
puts the wrong focus on the sentence--we are not really concerned about the status of the 
Library of Congress in this article. 'Nine of ten . . .  ' would be better, she said; the word 
'out' is superfluous. And does the Library of Congress buy the books that it houses? No. 
Publishers give books to the Library of Congress, as required by law. 
The second sentence noted that the problem is plaguing fine book collectors, among others. 
What does 'fine' modify here, Rosalie asked: the books or their collectors? 
"Yet many books several hundred years old are in excellent condition, Dr. Norman 
Shaffer, the congressional library's director of preservation, said yesterday." 
Rosalie thought the subject and verb too far apart. Moreover, she said, it raises the 
question: " Why are they in excellent condition?" 
Other points: " . . .  the cheaper process of making their products . . .  "-cheaper than what? 
"Another solution lies in persuading . . .  "-a solution to what? And who should be doing 
the persuading? Rosalie saw a systematic error here. A hallmark of good writing is that 
it answers more questions than it raises, she said. 
Someone asked whether reporters perhaps write a little sloppily in the knowledge that 
the copy-editor will go over their copy and clean it up? Rosalie said that they certainly 
3houldn't do this. Someone else pointed out that it's probably a bad idea to start talk­
ing about solutions (to problems) in the same breath as chemical solutions. This is the 
"unfortunate coincidence" problem that Don talked about recently. 
Rosalie shuddered over an extremely awkward sentence about acids and alkalis-fortunate­
ly someone in the class was able to decipher and explain it. "One hopeful sign . . .  " was 
another problem-the sign is not full of hope. Over and over again we saw sentences in 
which the subject and verb are separated by many words-these are hard to read. Rosalie 
pointed out a number of places in which whole phrases could be dropped without any loss 
of meaning: "Dr. Shaffer said one of the most encouraging signs is the fact he has heard 
one of the largest paper manufacturers . ' . .  " can be reduced to "Dr. Shaffer said one of 
the largest paper manufacturers . . .  " .  Whenever you see "he has heard" you can often 
improve or delete it, Rosalie said. A similar case: "The reason for removing the spaces 
from the list is that . ,  . "  can be (better) written "We remove the spaces because . . .  " . 
Rosalie conceded that good writing is very difficult. We must strive to be clear, coherent, 
accurate, and concise. This last is especially imp,ortant, she said, and quoted Pascal: 
"I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter." 
Rosalie was pleased to note that the first drafts of our term papers were quite a bit better 
than something else she had read recently-a report by a local software company. After 
just a few weeks we are pushing out the envelope of Silicon Valley literacy! But many of our 
sentences could be improved, she said, by cutting them shorter. Out with the semicolons, 
in with the periods. Don't write one long sentence if you can say the same thing in two 
short ones. A semicolon should be used only where the separated clauses have a very 
close relationship, and even there a period is often better. She quoted William Zinsser 
in his book On Writing Well as saying "The semicolon all too ell$ily conveys 'a certain 
[§41 .  ROSALIE STEMER ON COpy EDITING 103) 
[ 1 04 
19th-century mustiness' and slows the pace of the writing." Another common error was 
the frequent repetition of a word like 'this', 'they', 'just', or 'then'. Reading the piece 
aloud will often help you spot such over-uses. 
Rosalie wasn't too keen on some of the conversational idioms that crept into our writing: 
sentences that begin 'Anyway, . . .  '; an algorithm described as 'pretty straightforward' 
(perhaps a bad idea in a paper on pretty-printers?). Neither did she like the phrase 
'again iterate through'-this sounds awkward; surely the same point could be put more 
smoothly? A lot of sentences suffered from not having their subject near the beginning: 
"If . . .  , the graphic interface . . .  " .  Someone suggested that these kinds of problems-as 
well as over-use of the passive voice-are easily avoided if we stick to a subject-verb-object 
style. 
Someone asked whether 'in the context of' wasn't a "noise-phrase" --one that could be 
deleted without any loss of meaning? Rosalie said that this was often so, but that some­
times it can mean something. In the example we were looking at, the phrase had been 
used early on, so it seemed reasonable to repeat it somewhere else to make it clear to the 
reader that we were once again talking about the same thing as before. 
A student asked whether perhaps there aren't different styles of writing appropriate to 
scientific journals and to newspapers? Newspapers would probably put a greater premium 
on simple, direct sentences, for example. Rosalie said that there might be something in 
this, but that clear writing was always good. 
The sentence "Each of the b.z's are then multiplied by this factor" can be improved on 
two counts: Change 'are' to 'is' and eliminate the passive voice. How about: "Multiply 
each b.z by this factor"? 
If you are using commas to insert a parenthetical note, you must put a comma on both 
sides: " . . .  this node, b, is thus . . .  " .  
Rosalie didn't like a sentence that began 'It is unlikely . . .  ' "  The pronoun reference problem 
appears: What is unlikely? There is no uniform rewrite-rule for this, but we can usually 
find an alternative construction that conveys the same meaning. Like Jeff Ullman, Rosalie 
wasn't enthusiastic about 'This is done by . . . 'i better, she said, to say "This procedure 
(process, step, etc.) is done by . . .  " .  
A very common error is the misplaced 'only'. To illustrate, Rosalie took the sentence "I hit 
him in the eye yesterday" and inserted 'only' in each of the eight possible positions. Sure 
enough, each resulting sentence carries a somewhat different force: 
Only I hit him in the eye yesterday. 
I only hi t him in the eye yesterday. 
I hit only him in the eye yesterday. 
I hit him only in the eye yesterday. 
I hit him in only the eye yesterday. 
I hit him in the only eye yesterday. 
I hit him in the eye only yesterday. 
I hi t him in the eye yesterday only. 
§41 .  ROSALIE STEMER ON COPY EDITING] 
• 
If you say "Here we only calculate the position of two vertices" you probably mean "Here 
we calculate the position of only two vertices" . 
We saw a sentence that contained four or five occurrences of the word 'then'-surely a 
trifle excessive? Someone remarked that the sentence was probably an anglicised version 
of a line of computer code, which abounds in 'if . . .  then . . .  's, sometimes deeply nested. 
Another line that caught Rosalie's eye was: " . . .  saving the computation for the place where 
it is really needed." The word 'really' was used again the same paragraph. She thought this 
sounded altogether too vague for a piece of technical writing: Is the computation needed 
or not? What is this "really needed"? There was a definite difference of opinion over 
this question: Some people in the class couldn't see any objection to this usage. Someone 
argued that the "really" amounted to stylistic advice (as in "when painting a house, be 
especially careful on the window-frames, where precision is really important" ), but it is 
by no means superfluous-the word makes a substantive contribution to the meaning of 
the sentence. Rosalie's objection stemmed mainly from the fact that the word "really" is 
much over-used in colloquial speech. In the end we agreed that it would probably be better 
to say something like: " . . .  saving the computation for those vertices where the additional 
work contributes more to the visual quality" . 
Can an object witness a property? To Rosalie's ear this was a strange construction. But 
the class assured her that this is common usage in computer science. Technical terms take 
on an anarchic life of their own! 
In the last minute, Rosalie showed us a list of pairs of words that are frequently-and 
sometimes amusingly-conflated. For example, 'prostrate' and 'prostate'. One common 
confusion is 'alternately' vs. 'alternatively'. These are not synonyms. (Alternately, Tracy 
and I take notes in class. You could read them, or alternatively you could take your own 
notes. )

§4�. Excerpts from class, December 9 [notes by TLL] 
Don started class by introducing Paul Halmos. Paul is a distinguished author, a professor 
of mathematics at the University of Santa Clara, and a spicy and entertaining lecturer. As 
Don said, "He brings our program of guest speakers to a triumphant conclusion." 
Paul started his lecture by wondering why we had called him here. "I don't have anything 
new to say," he said. "What I had to say has already been majorized by Don and Mary­
Claire." He said that even the act of talking about mathematical writing was difficult, by 
comparison with the act of talking about mathematics itself. We don't have to remember 
much about math, because we know its structure; we can develop and discover the material 
as we talk about it. The structure of mathematical writing is much more elusive, so how 
do we know what to say about it? Sure, Paul brought several pages of prepared notes to 
class, but he claims that even those won't help h.im much. 
Not that the subject of mathematical writing isn't important. Some mathematicians have 
disdain for anything other than great theorems. "Anything else is beneath them." But 
they are wrong. Mathematicians who merely think great theorems have no more done 
their job than painters who merely think great paintings. 
Paul has read our handouts, and he wants to make a few comments. He wants to have a 
dialog with us; he admonished us to break in whenever we feel the urge. 
He is going to drift in and out of many different topics but only after he has given us an 
anchor and a rough outline. The anchor? Two basic rules: 
Do organize material. 
Do not distract the reader. 
The outline? Four aspects of good mathematical communication: 
Semantics (words, and the job they do); 
Syntax (also known as grammar); 
Symbols (very meaningful to mathematical writers) ;  
Style (synthesis of the above). 
Turning first to Semantics, Paul spoke to us about the natural process of change inherent 
in language and how it affects our word usage. Some changes are good-some changes are 
bad. According to Paul, one of the most often discussed symptoms of that change is the 
word 'hopefully'. 
The most recent literary tradition, handed down to us by our grandparents, tells us that 
'hopefully' means the exact opposite of 'hopelessly' :  
"I  don't have have a chance in the world to be promoted," he growled hopelessly. 
"My chances look good," his colleague grinned hopefully. 
But another, impersonal use of 'hopefully' has become popular-an evasive form in which 
one can say "Hopefully he won't be re-elected" instead of "I hope he won't." This confiicts 
with the normal usage of other words that can end both -fully and -lessly. Although we 
may think that interest rates will rise, we don't say "Thoughtfully interest rates will rise." 
§42. PAUL HALMOS ON MATHEMATTCAL WRTTTNGj 
Although we may fear that muggers are in the street, we don't say "Fearfully those muggers 
are still out there." Consistent English usage would prohibit 
Hopefully I'll visi t you again next year, 
as much as it prohibits 
Hopelessly I'll not be able to come. 
Paul doesn't like the new usage, which he calls "illogical and ugly." The mere fact of change 
is bothersome. But he realizes that his is only one vote, and he seems to be outnumbered. 
On balance, it is perhaps a good change, one that might even make communication easier. 
"The English language won't collapse if the other side wins." In fact, Paul says, 
Arguably the change is a needed one. 
But he is surprised to hear himself saying that. 
Paul sees other changes as needless and careless. It grates on his ears when he hears, 
The earthquake decimated more than half the houses. 
Of course some would say, Why do we need to reserve a special word for the random 
destruction of one out of ten? Paul thinks muddying the meaning of the word is bad, but 
he admits that it is harmless. 
Other unneeded, and harmful, obfuscations should be discouraged. 'Imply' does not mean 
'infer',  and 'disinterested' does not mean 'uninterested'. To confuse these words is to' lose 
valuable distinctions. Tragically, the differences between these words are becoming so 
confused that if we are writing for a large audience, and if we need to make use of the 
distinctions, we probably shouldn't.  
Evidence of bad changes can even be found in our handouts. In §4, one of the TAs (not the 
one with the charming British Accent) used 'reference' as a verb. Paul's response: "There 
is no such verb, and if there were, it sure as hell wouldn't be transitive." How would it 
sound to say "1 quotationed the author"? 
Barry Hayes pointed out that in Computer Science, 'reference' is a technical term used 
as a verb. Technical terms like 'majorize' sometimes creep into our vocabularies. Don 
supported him by saying that computer programmers "reference and de-reference things 
all the time." Paul's response: "My condolences. You know, the French say English is 
ruining their language. How the French feel about English is how 1 feel about that." 
We moved on to Syntax. "Obviously," said Paul, "people approve of it; nobody uses un­
grammatical English on purpose." Syntax changes more slowly than semantics. However, 
he once heard the following lovely sentence: 
If I'da knowed I coulda rode, I woulda went. 
This has rhythm, it's communicative, it's personal; but of course it's not grammatical 
English. Therefore it distracts the reader from what is actually being said. Here's another 
non-made-up example: 
Us'll go along with she if her'll go along with we. 
[§42 . PA UL HALMOS ON MATHEMATICAL WRITING 
[ 1 08 
If we are trying to communicate with people who use such grammar, we should use their 
language so as not to distract them from what we're saying. But as technical writers we 
are presumably not addressing that audience, certainly not in print. 
Paul would like to advance the thesis that grammar is logic. This notion is abhorrent 
to linguists, who see grammar as illogical, inconsistent, and contradictory; and they are 
right. Nevertheless, grammar is the organizational principle that lies behind linguistic 
communication. A typical English sentence like 'He saw her' contains case, tense, and 
gender; such things give a tremendous amount of information in condensed form, and they 
can be seen as logic. To identify grammar with logic is less of an error than to reject logic 
altogether. 
Speaking of case, Paul says, "Cases are good things, even though in English by now they 
are vestigial." They do exist, and they must be treated with respect. We say 
I don't know him, 
but we wouldn't be caught dead saying 
I don't know he. 
Similarly, we say 
He is the President of France, 
but never 
Him is the President of France. 
Therefore we would not logically ask, 
Whom is the President of France? 
Simple, right? Well, there are more confusing cases too: 
I don't know who is the President of France. 
Or should it be 'I don't know whom is the President of France'? A grammatical push-pull 
is involved here. (The nominative wins, and 'Who' is correct.) 
Paul would like to stamp out abuses such as 'I hate whomever said that'. An attention to 
logical rules of grammar helps us to clarify our own thinking in general. 
Taking issue with part of our first handout, Paul says the rule "A preposition is a bad 
word to end a sentence with" is "reactionary grammarian balderdash". Consider: 
Palo Alto is a good place to live in. 
Don Knuth is fun to have a drink with. 
There aren't many people I would say that to. 
All of these are examples of prepositions in "post position" that could only be ruined by 
being made grammatically pure. (We have all heard Winston Churchill's famous statement 
about "the sort of nonsense up with which I will not put ." )  Why should we do gymnastics 
for sentences with only one preposition at the end? Paul gave us a famous sentence ending 
with five prepositions: 
.. 
What did you want to bring that book I didn't want to be read to out of up for? 
§42 .  PA UL HALMOS ON MATHEMATICAL WRITI.VG] 
On the discussed and re-discussed subject of 'which' and 'that', he says that :-'Iary-Claire 
stole his thunder. It is worthwhile to get it right, but it is not terribly important. 
We began discussing Symbols by discussing punctuation. Paul urges everyone (contrary 
to rule #25 in § 1 ) to place quotation marks logically, every time. He gave us what he 
sees as a ridiculous example from Kate Turabian, whom he calls "The Antichrist," in The 
Chicago Manual of Style: 
See the section on "Quotations," which may be found elsewhere in this volume. 
Paul was incensed. "Horrors" ,  he said. "You see the iJlogic, don't you? There's no 
reason for it . It's not a grammatical convention-it's a totally arbitrary typographer's 
convention. The battle against this sort of stupidity can be won." He has succeeded in 
getting his own books punctuated logically. Bob Floyd gave support by mentioning how 
deadly such conventions are in a book about computer programming. 
But then Don remarked that one of Paul's two main points was not to distract the reader. 
Paul said, "And your implied, snide, argument?" "Well," said Don, "I guess I'm implying 
that you think you're distracting only the copy editors and not the readers." "Yes, I believe 
that 's right, with respect to commas and quotation marks." 
Mary-Claire asked, "Just how far are you willing to go in the direction of logic? Are you 
willing to place periods outside the quotation marks in actual dialog that already has its 
own punctuation?" . Her example: 
He said, "No." . 
Paul said that if you push him in a corner he might go so fas as to say "Yes." .  And 
Mary-Claire responded, "That's what I thought. Luckily there's not much dialog in the 
sort of stuff you write." . (Paul conceded that he doesn't really have an ear for dialog and 
doesn't have immediate plans to break into the world of fiction. He would love to write 
a novel, some piece of literature that isn't expository, but he's not being held back by an 
inability to punctuate.) 
The second Symbols-related point that Paul wanted to bring to our attention was the 
subject of written versus symbolic numerals. He gave us an examples where 'one' could 
either be a pronoun or a numeral, depending on the context: 
What are we to do when x is one? 
The sentence preceding that one may have been 
The solutions of the equation are the singularities of the 
function we are studying. 
Or it may have been 
Everything is clear when x is 2 or greater. 
Another example (this time from Birkhoff & MacLane's classic text): 
The first few positive primes are 
2, 3, 5, 7, 11 ,  . . . . 
Any positive integer which is not one 
lS42. PAUL HALMOS ON MATHEMATICAL WRITING 1 09] 
[ 1 1 0  
or a prime can be factored . . .  
He urges us to remove such ambiguities by using ' 1 '  when we want to speak of the numeral. 
The number of solutions is either two or three. 
The only solutions are 2 or 3. 
Paul now moved on to the final area of discussion: Style. 
Rule #6 in § 1 suggests that we use 'we' to avoid passive voice. This use of 'we' is equivalent 
to "the reader and 1" . Paul says that even better is to avoid both passive voice and the 
use of 'we' through judicial use of imperative and indicative moods along with an outlying 
kind of non-sentential phrase. For example, 
We can now prove the following result: 
becomes 
A consequence of all this is the following result.  
Or, 
Consequence: A implies B.  
The latter technique can occasionally be used in a sequential manner, 
Consequence 1 :  X. Consequence 2: Y .  
ending wi th a final blaze of glory, 
Conclusion: Z .  
Alternatively, here's an example of imperative mood: 
All we need to do to get the answer is to replace x by 7 throughout. 
Just say 
Replace x by 7 throughout. 
Paul finds this less distracting. Using 'we' is not a crime, but it adds an irrelevant dimension 
that can often be replaced by something clearer and smoother. 
He gave a lengthier example of a typical passage that shows how both 'we' and passive 
voice can be avoided without sounding artificial: 
If U is (something) ,  then the spectral theorem justifies the assumption 
(something) . If f is (something) ,  then (something) equals (something) .  
Since, however, y is (something) , it follows that· (something) .  Since, 
moreover, the assumption (something) imples that (something) ,  the Le­
besgue theorem is applicable. This completes the proof of convergence. 
(The example would be more effective, of course, if the (something) s  were replaced by 
meaty concepts, but that would distract us from the point at issue.) 
* Passive, God forgive me, or at least not active; but this phrase is standard aJ;ld inof· 
fensive to my ear. 
§42. PA UL HALMOS ON MATHEMATICAL WRITl.V; ! 
An audience member asked if using 'we' introduced a light tone that imperative doesn' t  
have. Paul agreed that it does, and stated that he isn't sure he wants that tone in his 
writing. 
Another questioner asked about first person singular? Paul likes it, but he admits that it 
can be disturbing: "Who does that jerk think he is?" He reluctantly agrees that the first 
person singular should be avoided in formal technical writing. 
Leslie Lamport asked at this point if the use of 'we' could not be avoided by avoiding 
prose proofs in favor of tabular proofs. Paul didn't like that idea at all: He finds symbols 
insidious and much prefers prose proofs. But then he had second thoughts, saying that he 
and Lamport might not disagree too much on the need to rethink the techniques of proof 
presentation. Outline form (not too heavily symbolic) might be advantageous. 
Paul said that he casts all possible votes in favor of Rule #9 in § 1 :  Do not echo unusual 
words. We had been told that this is a good idea because it avoids monotony. Paul says 
that it is a good idea because two uses of the same word in unrelated passages will be 
associated in the reader's mind and cause unwarranted connections. (Bob Floyd says that 
it will also cause technical typists to omit all words between the two occurrences.)  
Paul's next bugaboo ( "Do I dare do this thing?") was the phrase 'he or she' when he 
feels the traditional neuter pronoun 'he' would be sufficient. As soon as he brought this 
up, Mary-Claire disagreed, but Paul held the floor and quoted from authority by reading 
Mary-Claire's words from page 4 of her own book: 
This 'his' is generic, not gendered. 'His or her' becomes clumsy with repetition 
and suggests that 'his'. alone elsewhere is masculine, which it isn't. 'Her' alone 
draws attention to itsfM and distracts from the topic at hand. 
Mary-Claire responded, "Deeply moving quotation, but it is not true that the traditional 
solution to this problem in English is 'he'. The traditional solution is 'they'." 
Many people in the audience stated pieces of opinions, but time was nearly up. "To each 
their own." Paul moved to the next topic: Proof by contradiction. He emphasized that 
proofs by contradiction should not be used if a direct proof is available. For example, 
he noted that. proofs of linea.r independence' often say, "Suppose the variables are linearly 
dependent. Then there are eoefficients, not all zero, such that . . .  contradicting the as­
sumption that the coefficients are nonzero." This circuitous route can usually be replaced 
by a direct argument: "If the linea.r relation . . . holds, the coefficients are all zero. Hence 
the variables are linearly independent." 
Don pointed out that proof by contradiction is often the easiest way to prove something 
when you're first solving a problem for yourself, but such stream-of-consciousness proofs 
don't usually lead to the best exposition. 
Paul wound up his speech by repeating his opening rules: "Do organize," and "Do not 
distract. " 
The trouble is that it is hard to say what organization is. But we recognize it when we see 
it. "Give me a book, or a paper or a manuscript, and I'll tell you if it is organized," said 
[§42. PAUL HALMOS ON MATHEMATICAL WRITING 1 1 1 1  
[ 1 1 2  
Paul. The material is in linear order, but organization means much more than that. " The 
plot of an exposition is rarely a straight line." Branches and alternative threads must be 
woven together. Paul says he spends most of his writing time working on organization of the 
material. He suggests that we look at Roget's Thesaurus, an Encyclopedia, a do-it-yourself 
article, and a·good textbook, for increasingly complex examples of non-linearly-organized 
presentations. 
"Do organize," and "Do not distract." Except that all rules are made to be broken. When 
you want to jar your readers, Paul suggests that you distract them by changing your 
notation, screaming ungrammatical sentences, or being awkwardly repetitious. 
His final words to the class were, "Anything that helps communication is good. Anything 
that hurts is bad. And that's all I have to say." 
§43. Excerpts from class, December 1 1  [notes by TLL] 
The final lecture of CS 209 was partially devoted to course evaluation. (We were, no doubt, 
harsh but fair. )  Don told us that we would spend the last 40 minutes of class looking at 
the notes of people who have been going over our handouts but haven't had a chance to 
speak. (More course evaluations, perhaps?) Don said that he wanted to "end on a note of 
honesty and truth." 
The first comments that he addressed were from Nelson Blachman (father of course member 
Nancy Blachman).  Nelson is very interested in writing (he writes papers frequently), and 
he took the time to suggest improvements to the first few handouts. 
Don liked some of these suggestions, but he found others incompatible with his personal 
style. He said, "The main thing that I get from this is that the style has to be your own. 
You will write things that someone else will never write." Don says he has learned this 
lesson well by writing an annual Christmas letter with his wife, Jill. "We get along 364 
days of the year," he said, "but there is no way that we can write a sentence acceptable 
to both of us." (They have solved the problem by writing alternate paragraphs.) 
Among Nelson's suggestions were: 
Changing 'the above proof' to 'the proof above'. Don agrees with this change 
mostly because editors are forever calling him on it, but the original usage doesn't 
sound terribly odd to him. Nelson says that 'above' and 'below' are two adjectives 
that never precede the things they modify. Don thinks 'above' has become an 
adjective, but 'below' hasn't (yet). 
Changing ' ,  i.e.' to ' ;  i.e. ' .  Don says that that is a matter of taste and pacing. 
Changing the spelling of 'hiccups' to 'hiccoughs'. Don's dictionaries preferred the 
shorter spelling. 
Changing 'depending on the usage, the terms this, that, or the other might be 
used' to 'depending on the usage, the term this, that, or the other might be use<:i'. 
Don didn't see this as an improvement. 
343 · FINAL TRl"THSi 
- " 
/ 
Changing 'programming language notation' to 'programming-language notation'. 
Don said that the suggestion might be appropriate for readers in other disciplines, 
but in our field the hyphenation would become annoying. Analogous cases are 
'random number generator' and 'floating point arithmetic', each of which is po­
tentially ambiguous, but so familiar in computer science that a hyphen looks 
wrong. 
Then Don briefly showed us an example of a problem that often occurs when mathemati­
cians are allowed to typeset their own text. A novice typesetter tends to make fractions 
like n(n+1;(2n+1) instead of using the more readable slashed form n(n + 1 )(2n + 1)/3 .  
Next, we returned to Mary-Claire'S essay on 'hopefully' (see §26 above). Don says that 
he passed it out to us more for the style of the essay than the content, but it does make 
good technical points as well. To his surprise, Mary-Claire said that after re-reading it 
she actually wanted to improve the style. (This proves once again that nothing is perfect . )  
Here is what Mary-Claire wrote to him: 
1 )  The dates should be expressed in the same terms. Given that I'm going to need to 
say '1637', I have to say 'late in the 1500s', not 'late in the 16th century'. 
2) The sentence 
Impersonal substantives, on the other hand, serve less often than per­
sonal ones at the head of the kind of active verbs we modify with adverbs 
of manner 
is so horrid I'd prefer to think I was drunk when I wrote it. To fix it I have to 
rewrite the whole paragraph, sliding 'adverb of manner' up earlier: 
As with most adjectives, both of these 'hopeful's regularly produced 
'-ly' adverbs of manner. The kind of hopefulness that means expectant 
and eager produced adverbs more readily than the kind that means 
promising and bright. There's nothing mysterious about that difference 
in frequency. The pattern 
(personal noun) (active verb) (adverb of manner) 
is very common. People can carry themselves hopefully or eye a desirable 
object hopefully or prepare themselves hopefully for a possible future. 
The pattern 
(impersonal noun) (active verb) (adverb of manner) 
is less common. Impersonal nouns serve less often than personal ones 
as subjects of the kind of active verbs that we modify with adverbs of 
manner. Nonetheless, a wager can be shaping up hopefully, a day can 
begin hopefully, . . .  etc. 
Bob Floyd sent a few comments to Don, beginning with his opinion of the usage of. hope­
fully. First , he reports that only 44% of the American Heritage Usage Panel found the 
[§43 .  FINAL TRUTHS 1 1  :I ]  
[1 1 4  
use of hopefully as a sentential adverb acceptable. Bob also provided several authoritative 
quotations to support his objection to its use. (Don said that this is the main concern: 
Using 'hopefully' raises hackles in many people, distracting them from what you're trying 
to say; that's why he doesn't use it .  But he thinks some of the documents that Bob uses to 
support his position were probably written by the the people that Mary-Claire was calling 
ignorant in her essay.) 
Tom Henzinger, who is Austrian, observed that the German language has a common 
word 'hoffentlich' that corresponds precisely to the new English usage of 'hopefully'. This 
reminded Don that he often needs words that the English language just doesn't have. For 
example, we have hundreds of ways to say that Jane beat Jim, but we have few ways to 
say that Jim lost to Jane. (And we have to use two words in the latter case where only 
one is needed in the former.)  Don said: 
Our language often lacks verbs that correspond to "reflexive" relations. We have 
an abundance of words like 'dominate' but none like 'dominate or equal to'. So 
we must use long-winded phrases like 'less than or equal to'; sometimes, but not 
often enough, we can say 'at most'. 
Returning to Bob Floyd's comments, Bob sent Don several citations to support his claim 
that exclamation points should be used only with actual exclamations or interjections. 
Some examples: Ouch! Stop! Thief! Well, I'll be! To Don's surprise, none of the authorities 
even mention that exclamation points can indicate surprise! Paul Halmos, speaking from 
the peanut gallery today, told about a trick he has to get around this: You can put the 
exclamation point in parentheses(!).* Then everybody is happy, because you've made an 
exclamation of surprise. 
Bob said, "Advice to always avoid splitting infinitives is unwise." Don agreed that split 
infinitives can provide good emphasis and that rewrites can sound forced or awkward. 
About not ending sentences with prepositions, Bob said, "You have no case, give up." Don 
agreed, saying that he had not understood the issue. "Coming from Milwaukee, where half 
the people speak English with a heavy dose of German, has made me oversensitive to 
sentences that end funny." However, there is a problem with sentences ending with prep­
ositions, namely when they already have a structure that accommodates the preposition 
in the middle: 
Avoid such prepositions, which such sentences end with. The people who don't 
like the rule against prepositions in post position would never think of writing 
such sentences, so they probably have forgotten why the overly restrictive rule 
was first formulated. 
Bob next objected to Don's suggestion not to omit 'that's. Don admitted that there are 
cases when leaving out a that produces a better sentence. For example, 'He said he was 
* Don was able to use that trick the next day in Chapter 8 of his book. (Who said this 
course wasn't practical?) But he found that it was like an unusual word: You can't easily 
repeat it twice in the same chapter. 
§43.  FINAL TRUTHS) 
/ 
going' is a better sentence than 'He said that he was going. ' But, in this example ·that · 
is not needed as a grammatical help because the pronoun (in nominative case) keeps the 
syntax clear. In technical writing we often have more complicated sentences, which can 
benefit from the extra information that 'that' provides. 
Someone in the class mentioned a related issue: Should the word 'then' be used in sentences 
like "If I get there early enough, (then) I will save you a seat." (Rosalie had suggested 
that it should not . )  Don says that there is a difference between technical writing and 
newspaper writing, and he believes that well placed 'then's can make a paper more easily 
understood. In that particular sentence he would definitely leave out 'then' :  but in mathe­
matical contexts (where the phrase after the comma is likely a mathematical statement) he 
would definitely leave it in. Don says that our brains only have time to do simple parsing 
when we are reading for speed and comprehension. As Paul Halmos said, "Anything that 
helps communication is good." 
The final subject that Don introduced was a behind-the-scenes discussion between Mary­
Claire, Don, and one of the class members: Dan Schroeder. Dan received the comments on 
his term paper and objected to the claim that he had "wicked-whiches" ; he gave involved 
logical reasoning in support of why his whiches really should be whiches. Don said, "If you 
have to think that long about the sentence, it is probably wrong." Mary-Claire said that 
writers have to contend with overly-sensitive readers like Don, who wince at all whiches 
that aren't preceded by commas or prepositions. 
In one place Dan did not place a comma before a which because he was concerned about 
coincident commas. This is what Mary-Claire has to say about coincident commas: 
Coincident commas are not a sign of bad construction, any more than the co­
incidence of a final comma and a period, or a final comma and a semicolon, or 
any other two marks of punctuation. Where two commas coincide, we write only 
one. Where a comma and a period coincide, we write the period. Etc. Truly, 
coincident punctuation is not a problem. 
(Did you catch the coincident periods there?) 
After this comment we were thrown from the room in order to make way for another class. 
As always in this course, there was more to say than there was time to say it in. 
Postscript: The instructor received an anonymous contribution after class, in response to 
his request for a poetically stated computer program: 
This algorithm to count bits 
Rotat es VALUE one left and sums its 
tvo ' s-comp negation 
in a zeroed location

(Not only does this rhyme and scan, it also works. In fact ,  it may be the fastest way to 
do sideways addition on the GE635 and similar machines.)
