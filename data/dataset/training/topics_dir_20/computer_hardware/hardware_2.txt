What are peripheral devices?
What is meant by the terms a. Input  b. Output  c. Storage?
List four devices for each of a. Input b. Output c. Storage.
For each of the devices listed below, copy their name and describe briefly what
each is used for, and who would be most likely use them:
a. Joystick i. Dot matrix printer
b. Digitising tablet j. Laser printer
c. Touch sensitive screen k. Robot
d. Light pen l. Voice Answer Back
e. Optical Mark Reader (OMR) m. Hard disk

h. VDU
Choose two of the input devices and compare them.
Think about how easy they are to use, what they are to be used for, and how
suitable they are for a particular purpose.
Choose two output devices and compare them.
Think about who will read the output (is it for use within the company or will it go to
customers and clients).  Consider the speed of the device, the quality of the output,
the cost of the device and of the materials it uses.
Choose two of the storage devices and compare the benefits of one over the other.
