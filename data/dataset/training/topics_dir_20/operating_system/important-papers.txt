CAppendixImportant OS
papers
This Appendix contains important operating system papers. What makes them
important? There are a variety of ways for a paper to get included in this list.
Some papers contain fundamental breakthroughs in operating system design
or specific operating system functional areas. Others describe research that lead
the way for new areas of innovation. Some describe promising research that
has not yet borne fruit. Some provided a distillation of previous work, but that
distillation resulted in better understanding of operating system functionality
that lead to new research or solutions. The list of important papers here is
not all inclusive, of course, but tries to be a fundamental reading list for those
interested in core operating systems research publications.
